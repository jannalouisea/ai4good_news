But the “yaki?”

You might not understand why Vivian Kaye’s million-dollar, Hamilton-based hair extension business carries the tongue-in-cheek name, KinkyCurlyYaki.

Certainly, she says, banks and business advisers have not.

But the women who buy Kaye’s products online — 80 per cent of them in the U.S. — they get it.

“If you’re a Black woman who’s ever worn hair extensions you know what yaki is,” said Kaye, 42.

The term originates from the yak hair that was used in the past to make hair extensions and weaves. The silky texture of “yaki” hair resembles a Black woman’s hair that had been chemically straightened — a style that used to be the standard professional look for Black women.

Kaye’s company is an offshoot of her own search for naturally textured hair — all KinkyCurlyYaki products are made from human hair sourced in India and manufactured in China.

She has been overlooked by banks, business accelerators and other agencies that failed to understand her products and her market. But that has also cost them the opportunity to participate in KinkyCurlyYaki’s success.

Now she wants to share what she has learned by coaching other women, who don’t necessarily have the vocabulary, confidence and experience to parlay their ideas into a thriving enterprise.

“Any time I talk to anyone who is in a position to give money, they always ask, ‘How did you build a $1 million business and no one’s given you money to do it or to grow it,’ ” she said.

The answer is obvious: “I’m not serving an interest that would be of interest to you. The demographic I serve looks like me.” said Kaye.

“It’s almost as if no one wanted to help me just get a piece of my own self,” she said.

Black hair care is a $6 billion industry dominated by Asian manufacturers and suppliers. But they weren’t supplying the kind of textured hair that Kaye wanted.

“I wanted to look ‘presentable’ but I wanted something that would look authentic on me. What I found was that when they did have kinkier textured hair it was buried underneath the silkier textures,” she said.

“They were always selling silky hair because that was seen as beautiful whereas nappy hair or kinky hair was seen as ugly,” she said.

During a recent video chat, with her six-year-old son Xavier in the background watching TV in their Hamilton living room, Kaye appears more suburban soccer mom than the polished entrepreneur pictured on the KinkyCurlyYaki website. Her long gold painted nails are the only visible link to the beauty business.

She spent her early adult life working in Toronto but since Xavier she’s replanted herself in the Hammer close to her immigrant family who came to Canada from Ghana when Kaye was a baby.

Her dad was a mechanic. Her mother stayed home to raise four girls. After attending French immersion at Cathedral High School in Hamilton, Kaye headed to York University to study anthropology but she dropped out following a bout of depression.

Her French helped her land a series of call centre jobs and she loved the customer service aspect of the work. Eventually she made her way to a tech start-up where she was a one-woman marketing department.

When that ended, she took a job with an office services franchise company. She ran a wedding decorator business on the side.

She remembers wanting a bigger car for her business. When she slipped out to a dealership on her lunch hour, the salesman said her vehicle was worthless on a trade.

Her manager noticed she was down and he offered to go back with her.

“We went there the next day — me and my big, white, tall male boss — and literally all they could talk about was golf. And the guy was, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah, we’ll give her this for the trade-in….’ And the next thing you know I had a truck,” she said.

Even as a wedding decorator, she recognized the shocked expressions when meeting clients she had previously only spoken with on the phone.

“Racism is alive and well, the quiet racism we have here in Canada,” says Kaye.

She left her full-time office job in 2010 when her wedding decor business was doing well and she wasn’t worried about making rent on her Mississauga apartment.

Two years later at a networking event, a Black woman pulled her aside and asked about her hairdresser. Kaye had sourced her hair, going through a manufacturer to get the precise textured products she wanted. But she wasn’t thinking about selling the look.

“That woman asking me if I would tell her who my hairdresser was paid the highest compliment. She, as a Black woman didn’t know I was wearing a weave. She thought it was my own hair,” said Kaye.

That is when the light bulb went on.

When the summer wedding season died down in December 2012, the idea resurfaced. Kaye remembers thinking, “Let’s just launch the thing. Let’s just sell some hair online.”

The business took off. In 2013, KinkyCurlyYaki had done just under $500,000 (U.S.) in sales.

“This is someone who was an immigrant, a college drop out, who had no idea how to run an e-commerce business,” she says.

In 2016, after becoming pregnant, Kaye moved back to Hamilton, bought a house and ran the business from her basement. She was so busy raising her son, it took her about three months to notice that sales had passed the $1 million mark.

KinkyCurlyYaki now operates out of a 1,000 sq. ft. warehouse space in Hamilton.

“When I look back I’m really disappointed because I didn’t have access to any other resources. I wish I was more educated about taking on debt,” she says.

She had her immigrant parents’ aversion to debt and operated on cash.

“It worked for me but I think it was detrimental to the growth of my business,” she says.

Encouragement and education were scarce.

The bank that monitored the movement of U.S. funds into her account — part of the payment system Kaye was using at the time — would call to ask where all that U.S. money was coming from but never offered to help her expand.

Two years ago, she attended a pitch competition in Montreal — an event where entrepreneurs showcase their ideas to attract funders. Kaye wasn’t pitching but she noticed who was.

“White guys … were getting money for ant farms that didn’t exist. Here I had a viable product that was actually making money and I couldn’t get money for it,” she says.

She was encouraged to apply to the Canadian Technology Accelerator in New York. When she did, she says she was told, “We love you but we don’t know how to help you. We don’t understand the demographic, we don’t understand the product that you’re doing, we don’t have any connections in that industry.”

But, she adds, “I’m pretty sure if I had an ant farm they would figure out who could help me.”

“A lot of businesses like mine fall through the cracks because we don’t have the connections or the network that a lot of other people do.”

Now with COVID-19 interrupting KinkyCurlyYaki’s supply chain, Kaye has turned her attention to business coaching and mentorship through a company called Founders Fund.

It’s an offshoot of another social enterprise called, Tease Tea. Its CEO Sheena Brady and Kaye are peer mentors who connect about every three weeks to discuss their challenges and celebrate their victories.

Started last year, Founders Fund is a national membership-based, online growth accelerator, providing mentoring, leadership and grants to women entrepreneurs, who are vulnerable of slipping through the cracks.

Among its approximately 500 members, 34 per cent identify as women of colour and 31 per cent identify as immigrants. Of the $225 annual membership fee, 50 per cent goes directly into funding grants for women’s enterprise, said Brady.

In its inaugural year, Founders Fund gave about $40,000 to five companies, she said.

“(Kaye) just got what we were doing from Day 1, where a lot of people didn’t get it. We need to have successful people who have made it on the other side,” said Brady. “She’s an incredible storyteller. She’s really good at keeping people engaged and inspired.”

Kaye is passionate about the program “because there was nothing like that available to me. Because I’m part of it, other women of colour joined,” she said.

Black women don’t go where they don’t see themselves, said Kaye.

When white women tell her they don’t understand that, she asks them to think about their own discomfort when they are in a room full of men.

“If you don’t feel welcome or appreciated in that space, how do you think we feel going into all white people spaces?

“If we are welcome the next thing we know the photographer’s there taking pictures specifically of you because they want to show how diverse the event is,” she said. “Sometimes I’m willing to be that token because then I’m getting my foot in the door.”

Kaye wants to help build the confidence of “women who don’t fit into that girl boss criteria, that skinny white woman drinking lattes with her white friend and Gucci purse.

“I’m the exact opposite of that. I’m a plus-sized, Black single mother who shops at Dollarama and understands the struggle.”",[],1540,0.920270930270653

Perez',2020-07-13 00:00:00,"In a work-from-home world, hitting the local café for a daily caffeine fix has become a ritual of the now-forgotten past. And no matter how much kitchen brewing consumers take up, that just can’t seem to make up for the demand blow.

Global coffee consumption is set to fall this year for the first time since 2011, the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts. That’s even with a huge surge in bean buying at the grocery store amid pantry loading. Shutdowns for cafés and restaurants — which typically account for about 25 per cent of demand — were overwhelming, and it could be a while before things pick up again.

The disappearance of café culture is happening in every major region. Researcher Marex Spectron estimates globally more than 95 per cent of the out-of-home market was shuttered at some point during the pandemic. It’s the latest cruel twist of the coronavirus, which has ripped so much away from people that not even the simple pleasure of lingering over a latte is safe.

For Notes, a coffee-shop chain in London, restrictions are easing in the city, but most of its 10 cafés that cater to office workers remain closed.

“It will be a slow and staggered comeback for us as a lot of the offices in London are not coming back on until after summer, and some may even open only next year,” said co-founder Robert Robinson.

Consumers have shown they’re hesitant to dine out in droves again as economies reopen. Coffee shops, which often depend on morning commuters and afternoon breakers, have been especially hard hit. Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. has lost much of its breakfast crowd during the coronavirus pandemic, while Starbucks Corp. is retooling its model, rolling out a “pickup” store format that doesn’t have any of the tables and chairs that traditionally made its cafés a popular hangout spot.

“If you feel like having a cappuccino, ordering it online doesn’t really work as coffee is all about the social aspect,” said Robinson.

A hobbled recovery for coffee demand could be devastating for the roughly 125 million globally that depend on the crop for their livelihood. Growers were already struggling through financial crisis after years of bumper harvests sparked a prolonged bear market. Citigroup Inc. predicts that futures for arabica beans could drop roughly 10 per cent in the second half of the year to about 90 cents a pound, hovering near break-even costs. Meanwhile the International Coffee Organization has warned of the dangers of child labour in producing regions as poverty increases for farmers.

Brazil’s Suplicy Cafes Especiais, one of the country’s largest café chains, was forced to postpone payments to farmers for cargoes that had already been delivered. Meanwhile, orders for new supplies will resume only gradually, chief executive officer Felipe Braga said in a telephone interview.

Suplicy operates 25 stores, the vast majority of which have been closed by COVID-19 restrictions since mid-March. A handful reopened recently amid easing lockdown restrictions, but then they were shuttered once again because not enough customers were coming through.

“Some of our franchising partners already warned us that they will close” permanently, Braga said.

Still, some shop operators are taking steps to change their business model, which could help spark some rebound.

Max Crowley’s two Bandit coffee shops in New York’s Midtown and Chelsea neighbourhoods remain “on pause,” hobbled by the closure of local offices. Meanwhile, he’s just opened up a new Hamptons location in the Town of Southampton, an enclave where many New York City dwellers fled to at the peak of the pandemic and where well-to-do residents spend summers.

“Manhattan traffic is still very light. The Hamptons is very busy. It makes sense for us. It’s where many of our customers go,” Crowley said.

There’s also some optimism the worst is over.

In Asia, the fastest-growing market for coffee, consumption at restaurants and cafés is expected to recover in the second half of the year as many countries emerge from lockdowns, according to Tan Heng Hong, APAC food and drink analyst at market research company Mintel. And the USDA also predicts a rebound in global demand next year.

Still, a global second wave of infections could halt reopening plans. McDonald’s Corp. has said its pausing the resumption of all dine-in services in its U.S. restaurants as the virus flares up in areas across the country. And even if stores open, fears of contagion could continue to keep customers away. Starbucks is operating about 95 per cent of the company’s U.S. stores, but comparable sales were down 43 per cent in May.

Plus there’s the economic downturn, which generally spurs consumers to trim their dining out expenses.

The Dalgona coffee sensation — a fluffy, whipped beverage made from instant coffee that was popularized on social media — shows that consumers are trying to recreate the fun café experience at home instead. That could end up helping to rescue prices of robusta beans, used in instant varieties, to the detriment of pricier arabicas.

Robusta futures are down 13 per cent this year in London, while arabica beans slumped 25 per cent in New York.

“We believe that consumers will move down price points, and turn more to cheaper, instant coffee, as they tighten their belts amidst the gloomy economic outlook,” Taohai Lin, a consumer and retail analyst at Fitch Solutions. “Consumers will continue to embrace home brew and instant coffee, both because they will still avoid heading out to cafés, and also because it is generally a cheaper alternative.”",[],923,0.9255022297475769

Greg Abbott of Texas said that bars across the state would have to shut down a second time because coronavirus cases were skyrocketing, Mick Larkin decided he had had enough.

No matter that Larkin, an owner of a karaoke club in Wichita Falls, Texas, had just paid $1,000 (U.S.) for perishable goods and protective equipment in anticipation of the weekend rush. No matter that the frozen margarita machine was full, that 175 plastic syringes with booze-infused Jell-O were in place, or that there were masks for staff members and hand sanitizer for guests.

That day, June 26, Larkin and his partner dumped what they had just bought into the trash and decided to close their club, Krank It Karaoke, for good.

“We did everything we were supposed to do,” Larkin said. “When he shut us down again, and after I put out all that money to meet their rules, I just said ‘I can’t keep doing this.’”

It was harrowing enough for small businesses — the bars, dental care practices, small law firms, daycare centres and other storefronts that dot the streets and corners of every U.S. town and city — to have to shut down after state officials imposed lockdowns in March to contain the pandemic.

But the resurgence of the virus, especially in states such as Texas, Florida and California that had begun to reopen, has introduced a far darker reality for many small businesses: Their temporary closures might become permanent.

Nearly 66,000 businesses have folded since March 1, according to data from Yelp, which provides a platform for local businesses to advertise their services and has been tracking announcements of closings posted on its site. From June 15 to June 29, the most recent period for which data is available, businesses were closing permanently at a higher rate than in the previous three months, Yelp found. During the same period, permanent closures increased by three per cent overall, accounting for roughly 14 per cent of total closures since March.

Researchers at Harvard believe the rates of business closures are likely to be even higher. They estimated that nearly 110,000 small businesses across the country had decided to shut down permanently between early March and early May, based on data collected in weekly surveys by Alignable, a social media network for small-business owners.

Christopher Stanton, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who was one of the researchers, said it was difficult to accurately gauge how many small businesses were closing because, once they shut their doors for good, the owners were hard to reach. He added that it could take at up to a year before government officials knew the true toll the pandemic was taking on small businesses.

At the moment, 39 states continue to record growing numbers of new cases daily.

It is not clear how many of the businesses Yelp is tracking count as “small” — defined by the Small Business Administration as those with 500 or fewer employees. But the company found that, among the tracked businesses — which include restaurants, retailers and other independent, consumer-facing operations — retail businesses, led by beauty supply stores, have been closing at the highest rate since the pandemic began. Restaurants are the next hardest-hit group.

Small businesses account for 44 per cent of all U.S. economic activity, according to the SBA, and closures on such an immense scale could devastate the country’s economic growth. Collectively, such businesses are one of the largest employers in the country, said Satyam Khanna, a resident fellow at the Institute for Corporate Governance and Finance at New York University School of Law who has written about the effects of the pandemic on small businesses.

So when small businesses close en masse, an entire sector of the economy suffers, Khanna said. There is lower cash flow, higher debt and more unemployment. “That leads to a big drag on the eventual recovery,” he said. “Because they are such an important source of jobs, losing them the way we are losing them now is going to make things far worse than they otherwise need to be.”

Because small businesses depend heavily on foot traffic and operate on thin margins, they are especially vulnerable to the ripple effects of a widespread shutdown.

For nearly two decades, Rich Tokheim and his wife sold sports memorabilia — hats, T-shirts, coffee mugs and other trinkets — to fans in Omaha, Neb., at their store, The Dugout. Since 2011, The Dugout has occupied prime real estate across the street from the city’s 24,000-seat baseball stadium, which usually hosts the College World Series each spring.

The 2020 World Series was cancelled in March. In the weeks that came after, other sporting events were scrapped — starting with college sports and extending to professional leagues that have struggled to relaunch their activities.

Tokheim, 58, watched his business fall off with growing unease, but it was only after a friendly chat with a retired college athletic director in May that the gravity of his situation hit home. He was already worried about the state of the virus in Nebraska and whether there was enough tracking. Then the athletic director predicted that if college football was really cancelled for the year, it would be the end of Division I sports as a whole.

“That really put me in overdrive,” Tokheim said. He negotiated an early exit on his store lease and announced a clearance sale at the store. The Dugout closed for good June 30.

The government’s Paycheck Protection Program, rolled out in April and administered by the SBA, earmarked $660 billion of aid for small businesses but stipulated that a loan would be forgiven only if most of it was used to pay employee wages for eight weeks. The rules were later relaxed, but in a sign of how many small-business owners did not feel confident that they would be on steady ground by the time repayment was due, roughly $130 billion of aid money remained untapped when the program ended in June.

Even for those who took a PPP loan, survival is no guarantee. Nick Muscari, a 38-year-old restaurateur in Lubbock, Texas, availed of one of these loans. His restaurant, Nick’s Sports Grill and Lounge, had been the culmination of Muscari’s life’s work — his years of toil as a waiter, pizza cook and manager at restaurants and bars beginning in his teenage years. Three years ago, he bought out the two partners who helped him start the restaurant in 2010. He considered it a crowning achievement, but to do so, he had to borrow money. He still owes a bank $80,000.

Muscari tried to ride out the spring lockdown that temporarily shuttered his restaurant with the help of the PPP money. But when the state’s second closure order took effect June 26, he decided to close for good.

“It had been in the back of our minds, just like, you know, if this happens again, can we make it?” Muscari said. “We were following all the rules, and people were spread out. We never had anybody catch the virus in our establishment.”

Muscari, with the business closed and its 30 employees jobless, has nothing left but his house and his car. He also expects his landlord to try to sue him for the eight years’ worth of rent he is contracted to pay on his defunct restaurant’s space.

Many small businesses are also finding it onerous keep up with constantly changing local guidelines, while others are deciding that no matter what their local officials say, it just is not safe to keep going.

Gabriel Gordon, owner of a tiny but popular barbecue restaurant in Seal Beach, Calif., decided to close permanently after studying the restaurant’s layout. He had determined that the kitchen would never be safe for multiple staff members to occupy at once while the virus was still active in the area.

“It’s essentially two hallways that are 11 feet wide,” Gordon said, describing the shape of the restaurant, Beachwood BBQ. “There are food trucks that are larger than my kitchen.”

Whatever the specific reasons may be for each closure, Justin Norman, Yelp’s vice-president of data science, said that the federal government should offer small businesses more help. Norman said Yelp was concerned about the effects of small-business closures, especially those owned by people of colour, on society. Yelp, however, also has a financial interest in maintaining a robust small business environment, because it relies heavily on advertising by businesses on its platform.

“The time is right now to inject more capital, or we may lose them forever,” Norman said.

“It’s going to make our economies worse; it’s going to make our communities worse.”",[],1449,0.880768753926769

To its credit, when it officially reopened its Magic Kingdom on Saturday, Walt Disney World went beyond a policy to “recommend and encourage” the face coverings as fellow Florida theme park Legoland has. They were mandatory for all guests 2 and over.

Even so, the decision to reopen the park highlights some stark international differences. On Sunday, Florida reported 15,300 new cases of Covid-19—a daily record for any state. On Monday, Hong Kong reported a multi-month high of 52, prompting its own Disneyland to close again. Note that it is no small city, with a population of around 7.5 million.

Those visiting Hong Kong Disneyland almost certainly came with their own masks, as they are nearly ubiquitous there. Many Americans eschew them and may not have had one when they showed up at the Orlando theme park. Disney World helpfully installed vending machines selling plain ones for $2 each at its gates—a sensible move and a fair price.

But Disney wouldn’t be Disney if it didn’t see a merchandising opportunity too. It will sell you a four pack of cloth masks depicting characters such as Mickey Mouse for $19.99.

Next up: Walmart,'Gunjan Banerji',2020-07-13 00:00:00,"Tesla Inc.’s shares vaulted toward another record Monday, continuing a head-spinning rally for the electric-car maker that has made it more valuable than many of the titans of American industry.

The company’s shares jumped 13% Monday to $1,744.11 (U.S.) and have more than quadrupled in value in 2020. The stock has climbed in nine of the past 10 sessions, rising nearly 30% in the past three trading days alone.

In comparison, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are sitting on small losses this year and the U.S. economy has entered a recession as the pandemic put a halt to business activity around the country.

How big has Tesla gotten? Tesla’s recent surge puts its market value of roughly $321 billion above that of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest bank in America; Procter & Gamble Co., and UnitedHealth Group Inc. The electric-car maker is also bigger than Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. combined, according to FactSet data.

The rally has been driven in part by optimism surrounding the company’s coming earnings report on July 22. Some investors are expecting the car maker to deliver a surprise profit. That would make the company eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 index, potentially driving even more activity around its shares. At least $1.6 trillion of mutual and exchange-traded funds track the index, according to Morningstar Direct data. A company must report an accumulated profit over four consecutive quarters to be included in the index. Tesla’s profits over the past three quarters have marked its longest run of profitability so far.

If it were in the S&P 500, it would be the 10th-biggest company in the index, slightly behind Walmart, whose market value is about $374 billion.

The rally is a remarkable feat for one of the most hotly debated stocks in the market. Equally passionate bulls and bears have pounced on Tesla—buying its shares or shorting the stock in a wager that the shares will tumble. The shares’ rapid ascent has evoked memories of the 1990s tech bubble for some investors. Others compare Tesla to a technology company such as Apple Inc. that is sure to change the world.

The survey, which polled about 1,000 people in Canada, found that 26 per cent of respondents have increased their use of contactless payments and 42 per cent have decreased their use of cash.

In the U.S., only 22 per cent reduced their use of cash, McKinsey found. The survey was taken in June and asked consumers about changes they made in the previous month.

“Canadians, more than people from other countries, are looking to reinvent how they will pay,” Miklos Dietz, a senior partner at McKinsey, said in an interview. Examples of contactless payment include paying bills online, ordering pizza via delivery apps or tapping a debit card on a payment machine at the supermarket instead of using cash.

“Financial institutions need to put payment strategy quite high on their strategic agenda because the shaping of the future of the Canadian economy will be heavily influenced by what’s happening with payments in the next year or so,” Dietz said.

Online services

This digital transition may be here to stay. According to McKinsey, 16 per cent of respondents say they will use online banking services more even after the COVID-19 crisis is over, and 23 per cent say they will visit branches less often for transactions.

The latter number is higher than in France, Germany and the U.S., where between 13 per cent and 17 per cent said they’ll use branches less often after the pandemic.

The survey also showed that people wanted help from banks through the economic uncertainty. Half of Canadians want financial institutions to waive late fees on credit card and loan payments and 42 per cent want them to reduce minimum credit card payments.

As such, less mainstream banking options may appear more attractive for customers, Dietz said. “I would expect new ideas coming from all financial institutions,” he said. “I think this is an unusually good opportunity for smaller financial players, credit unions, to be ahead of the curve.”",[],339,0.9346808499547729

The federal government is extending its wage subsidies for companies hit hard by COVID-19 until December, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday.

The subsidy covers 75 per cent of wages up to $847 weekly for employees of companies and non-profits that have seen a drop in revenue of at least 30 per cent.

The government has said the eligibility rules may be tweaked so that businesses aren’t discouraged from growing for fear of being cut off from the aid.

“We need to make sure the subsidy is appropriate for the challenges facing enterprises in actually rehiring and getting people back to work,” Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week.

The subsidy, which had paid out $18.01 billion to 252,370 companies as of July 6, is one of the federal government’s programs aimed at supporting the economy amidst the pandemic.

Daniel Lefebvre, vice-president of Restaurants Canada, said the extension is good news, but that he hopes to see changes to the program as well.

Lefebvre said he hopes that more businesses will be eligible. In a survey of Restaurants Canada members done in late June and early July, 44 per cent of respondents said they didn’t qualify for the subsidy.

The restaurant sector has been particularly hard hit, he said, and the subsidy has allowed many restaurants to open again.

Lefebvre also said many businesses are walking a tightrope: buoyed by the subsidy but operating at a limited capacity, they fear making just enough revenue that they won’t qualify for the subsidy anymore. “We have a lot of people that are right around the 30 per cent threshold,” he said.

He wants to see the subsidies scaled to allow for various levels of revenue loss and wage support, avoiding a “cliff” where restaurants go from having 75 per cent of their wages covered to none.

Last week’s fiscal and economic “snapshot” saw the program’s budget raised to $82.3 billion.

As the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) is slated to end in the fall, more Canadians will be looking to their employers to keep them afloat. As of July 5, 8.25 million people had received almost $54.8 billion through CERB.

In an emailed statement, the Retail Council of Canada welcomed the extension, calling it “critical to retailers of all sizes.” The council said it supports a “ramp” allowing for some wage support as revenues begin to climb again.

Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), said he’s “frustrated” that it’s taking so long for the government to release changes to the wage-subsidy program.

Like the Retail Council of Canada and Restaurants Canada, the CFIB is advocating for a scaled approach to eligibility so businesses aren’t placed at a disadvantage by making more than 70 per cent of last year’s revenue.

Kelly said such changes were promised back in May, when the government extended the program to August, but that those changes never came, and many businesses began July not knowing whether they would receive the subsidy.

“We need to know the details of who will qualify,” he said. “That all-or-nothing approach really doesn’t work.”

Kelly said he’s “optimistic” the changes will include a ramped approach to eligibility.

As COVID-19 raged across the U.S., Americans seeking out familiar flavours filled their shelves with salty, crunchy treats, driving double-digit sales growth for brands like Tostitos, Fritos and Cheetos. Even newer snacks like fruit-chips line Bare and Off The Eaten Path, a maker of black bean and chickpea crisps, saw double-digit growth. Beverage sales were one key weakness, as both in-restaurant and grab-and-go gas station sales lagged during the lockdowns.

“Consumer eating habits continue to evolve with consumers spending more time at home, which benefits the at-home breakfast, snacking and dinner occasions,” chief executive officer Ramon Laguarta said in pre-recorded remarks about the second quarter.

PepsiCo shares rose 2.3 per cent at 11:30 a.m. in New York after an earlier gain of as much as 2.7 per cent. The stock was little changed this year through Friday.

As one of the first big packaged-food companies reporting results for the spring months, PepsiCo is being closely watched by investors for a look at how consumers are responding to 2020’s upheaval. The company is well-positioned because of its high global share of the market for snack foods, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

And snack foods, it seems, carried the North American consumer through a difficult quarter. Ruffles potato chip brand saw high-single-digit growth, while oatmeal line Quaker’s organic revenue spiked 23 per cent in the quarter. The snack and beverage giant sees the trend toward more breakfast meals at home remaining strong after the pandemic subsides, and the company said it has marketing plans to retain any new Quaker customers it picked up during the quarantines.

With an increase in online grocery shopping, PepsiCo said its 5-year-old e-commerce business is projected to have $3 billion (U.S.) in sales this year, up from about $2 billion last year. While it’s not yet clear how much of the gains will be sustainable, chief financial officer Hugh Johnston said on a call with analysts “we’re prepared for it to stay large.”

Other packaged-food companies have been pummeled by Wall Street after reporting strong spring quarters, since investors didn’t see signs they could hold onto the gains. But PepsiCo says it’s optimistic it can capitalize on these new buying habits.

In fact, after reporting a 0.3 per cent slide in the latest period for organic revenue, a closely watched indicator of growth, the owner of the Mountain Dew and Doritos brands said that metric will turn positive in the current quarter, predicting a low-single-digit boost. The company said it still won’t make an outlook for 2020.

“As we look ahead for North America, we expect our overall business to perform well, assuming there is no large-scale disruption in economic activity or population mobility as a result of the recent surge in COVID-19 infections in many markets,” Laguarta said. “With this in mind, we expect our snacks and food businesses to remain resilient, albeit with some moderation in growth while our beverage businesses should deliver better performance during the second half of this year.”",[],513,0.9231747216226754

Trudeau, who said in a news conference he had spoken to the U.S. president earlier in the day, told him that with the North American economy getting back up to speed, Canada’s aluminum smelters would soon be back producing value-added specialty products for the American auto sector.

The spectre of new tariffs emerged last month after Canadian producers, unable to shut down production and with their usual customers hamstrung by the impact of COVID-19, were forced to make a more generic form of aluminum and ship it to warehouses in the United States.

That alarmed certain U.S. smelter owners and operators, who have been urging the U.S. trade representative’s office to slap fresh levies on imports from Canada.

The pandemic “caused certain disruption in the aluminum sector that is starting to realign itself, given the economies are starting up again and manufacturing is getting going,” Trudeau said after his call with Trump.

“I impressed upon him that it would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time where we’re celebrating NAFTA and at a time where we want our businesses and our manufacturers to get going as quickly as possible.”

Canada has been on the outside looking in when it comes to the coming into force of NAFTA’s successor, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which took shape in 2017 and 2018 before a backdrop of steadily worsening relations between Trump and Trudeau.

While Trump welcomed Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to a celebratory event at the White House last week, Trudeau kept his distance, citing the tariff dispute and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic among his reasons. A readout from Monday’s call said the prime minister “expressed regret” for being unable to attend.

The U.S. trade representative reportedly gave Canada a deadline of July 1 to impose export restrictions — the very day the USMCA took effect. That deadline has come and gone without a hint from either the White House or U.S. trade ambassador Robert Lighthizer about what happens next.

Trudeau said he and Trump also discussed the Canada-U.S. border, where non-essential travel has been curtailed since March in an effort to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus. The 30-day bilateral agreement to limit discretionary cross-border travel without restricting trade or essential workers has been extended three times and is now set to expire July 21.

Since the last extension, however, the public health crisis in the U.S. has exploded.

More than 100,000 new COVID-19 cases were identified over the weekend, particularly in southern states that reopened early, with Florida emerging as the new epicentre. Canada has had 108,000 confirmed cases in total, compared with more than 3.3 million cases and 135,000 deaths in the U.S. to date.

Hospitals in major urban centres across the United States are again nearing capacity and health care workers face another critical shortage of personal protective equipment like masks and respirators.

Recent polls suggest Canadians remain unequivocally opposed to reopening the border any time soon — a predictable symptom of the accelerating crisis in the U.S., said Kathryn Friedman, a University at Buffalo law professor and Wilson Center global fellow.

But there could be other lingering foreign-policy irritants at play, she added.

“I wonder if the United States had treated our dear neighbour, friend and ally a little bit better over the last three-and-a-half or so years, if the reaction would be as harsh,” Friedman said. “Maybe people are just like, ‘Well, too bad, I don’t care if you want to open the border.’”

Friedman is among several Canada-U.S. experts, border community leaders, northern state lawmakers and others who want to see a plan for when the time comes to lift the restrictions.

“I think we have to have this conversation,” she said. “I think we have to engage the right people now, so that when the border restrictions are eased, whenever that’s going to be, they are done so responsibly.”

It’s less a question of when and more a question of how, Friedman said — what sort of controls, testing and screening measures and other tools will need to be in place even after the emergency has passed.

“I’m more concerned that the climate will change, and some relevant government officials won’t have given any thought to how this border opening is going to take place,” she said.

“We have to get our act together and really think more clearly about how we’re going to handle these kinds of situations in the future, and really use science-based data — an evidence-based, science-based approach — to health screenings when it comes to border restrictions and border policies.”

Trudeau demurred Monday when asked whether this time, Canada and the U.S. might negotiate a closure that lasts longer than the standard 30-day window.

City of London companies played an important role for centuries in organizing and funding the trans-Atlantic passage of African slaves and the Caribbean and American plantations where they were forced to work. Directors of the companies earned fortunes from the trade. The Bank of England, Barclays PLC and Lloyd’s of London insurance market are among those to apologize for or acknowledge links to slavery since the May killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis prompted protests world-wide.

“Britain was the most efficient and profitable slave trader in terms of return on capital largely because of the role of the City of London in providing cheaper finance, better insurance rates, better reinsurance rates and, critically, funding the construction of the shipping industry,” Hilary Beckles, chairman of a reparations commission representing Jamaica, Barbados and 10 other Caribbean nations, said in an interview.

Mr. Floyd’s death has sparked renewed calls from Caribbean governments and from Black British campaigners descended from slaves for British companies to pay reparations. They say apologizing isn’t enough and are calling for more discussion about reparations. Companies are so far resisting those calls, choosing to focus on improving workplace diversity.

On July 6, the Caricom Reparations Commission, chaired by Mr. Beckles, called for British companies to participate in a summit to discuss how they can contribute to the Caribbean.

“The City of London as we know it now would not have been without the slave trade,” Mr. Beckles said. “We are calling for a dialogue in which we say from our point of view this is what we think would be an appropriate attempt at remedy. In the case of the financial institutions of London we are looking for a development strategy.”

The City of London Corp., a centuries-old council which manages the financial district, declined to comment on whether it would participate in a reparations summit, as did spokesmen for the Bank of England, Barclays, Lloyd’s of London, Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, Lloyds Banking Group PLC and law firms Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Farrer & Co. They have all acknowledged historic links to slavery.

British politicians have long resisted discussions on the issue. Speaking to Jamaica’s Parliament in 2015 on the most-recent official Caribbean visit by a prime minister, David Cameron emphasized Britain’s role in ending the slave trade. “I do hope that, as friends who have gone through so much together since those darkest of times, we can move on from this painful legacy,” Mr. Cameron said.

“Finance could be the best healer,” Darrel Blake, a former banker who leads a slave-trade money trail tour through London’s financial district, said on a June 20 tour.

The Bank of England said it wasn’t directly involved in the slave trade but “is aware of some inexcusable connections involving former governors and directors and apologizes for them,” a spokeswoman said.

Lloyd’s of London, the insurance market founded in the 1680s, said it was sorry for its role in the trade.

“This was an appalling and shameful period of British history, as well as our own, and we condemn the indefensible wrongdoing that occurred during this period,” a spokesman said.

A Barclays spokesman said the bank is “committed to do more to further foster our culture of inclusiveness, equality and diversity, for our colleagues, and the customers and clients we serve.”

Mr. Beckles said commitments to improve diversity are a public-relations stunt. “That is not a sincere effort to participate in reparatory justice,” he said. “We are talking about the damage and the harm done to millions of people and the death of millions of people.”

Last year he brokered a £20 million ($25 million U.S.) reparations agreement with Scotland’s University of Glasgow, which benefited from slavery. The university is raising the money mainly through grants and donations to work with the University of the West Indies on research projects to improve health care and economic development in the Caribbean. The agreement is a model for companies to follow but no such conversations have started, Mr. Beckles said.

“We are happy to share our experience,” David Duncan, the University of Glasgow’s chief operating officer, said in an interview.

That agreement has set a precedent that makes companies wary, said Malik Al Nasir, a British citizen who has researched his family history and found he’s descended from slaves and slave traders in Guyana.

“Companies know that there is liability here,” Mr. Al Nasir said in an interview. He wants the United Nations to lead a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate and quantify slavery reparations. U.K. lawmaker Layla Moran has written to companies with links to slavery and asked them to do more.

Calls for reparations for slavery are also increasing in the U.S. in the wake of Mr. Floyd’s killing, according to Ana Lucia Araujo, a Howard University professor who studies slavery. A bill embracing the idea was first introduced in Congress in 1989 but the issue of reparations has languished for decades.

The British government abolished slavery in the 1830s, paying £20 million—the equivalent of billions of dollars today—to compensate slave owners because they were deemed to have lost property. Beneficiaries are listed on a University College London website.

The government finished repaying debt used to fund the compensation payments in 2015. Compensating slave owners was unjust according to Mr. Blake, whose ancestors, like those of Mr. Beckles, were slaves.

“My taxes have gone back to the government to replace the money that was given to the slave masters that owned my family,” said Mr. Blake, who worked at Barclays and HSBC Holdings PLC before becoming a teacher. “How ridiculous is that?”",[],977,0.96487066881032

Scripps Co.’s Stitcher Inc. podcasting unit for $265 million (U.S.) in cash.

The satellite-radio giant’s foray into the rapidly growing podcasting industry follows similar moves by media and technology companies, including Spotify Technology SA and iHeartMedia Inc. Sirius said it could pay up to $60 million more if Stitcher achieves certain financial metrics in 2020 and 2021.

The Wall Street Journal last week reported that the two companies were nearing a deal.

Sirius said the transaction, expected to close in the third quarter, would enable it to reach more than 150 million listeners.

“With Stitcher, we will expand our digital audio advertising presence and look to generate new ways for creators to find and connect with their audiences,” Sirius Chief Executive Jim Meyer said.

Stitcher runs a free podcast listening app and a premium $4.99 monthly service that lets subscribers listen to podcasts without ads. It owns podcast networks such as Earwolf, Stitcher Originals and Witness Docs, and its shows include “Freakonomics Radio,” “SuperSoul Sunday from The Oprah Winfrey Network” and “Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend.” With outside networks and shows, Stitcher distributes and sells advertising for more than 250 podcasts through its Midroll media advertising unit.

Sirius generates most of its revenue from subscriptions to its satellite-radio service but in 2018 agreed to buy internet-radio streaming company Pandora Media Inc. for $3 billion—adding a business more reliant on advertising and with podcast aspirations of its own to its lineup.

Nearly half of COVID-19 deaths in Canada are linked to long-term care homes.

In a recent report on five nursing homes in Ontario, details emerged of elder abuse and neglect, unsanitary conditions and severe burnout among personal support workers (PSWs) in the throes of the pandemic.

But the challenges in the way Ontario cares for its seniors extend beyond recent months. PSWs in nursing homes feel chronically undervalued by the health-care system, receiving low pay for long hours and strenuous working conditions.

The Star asked students and recent graduates specializing in senior care and public policy what they see as solutions to Ontario’s nursing home crisis.

Lamia Aganagic, University of Toronto

We’re facing a big demographic challenge in Ontario. The number of seniors in need of care is expected to increase significantly by 2030. Provincial governments in particular are facing higher costs and spending on service provisions because we’re seeing an increasing number of seniors with one or more chronic conditions. You may find that patients are not only dealing with dementia and Alzheimer’s, but also a mobility impairment or mental illness. This all impacts the care they need to receive.

One way to alleviate the challenges is to look to virtual care; care that generally happens over the phone or through video. The Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN), which functions as a virtual-care network in Ontario, does this well — but the system could be expanded significantly.

Virtual care becomes especially useful when considering things like patient transfers at long-term care homes (LTC). Senior patients being transferred from an LTC home to the emergency department are at an increased risk of death because they’re exposed to a whole bunch of other things on the way, and they may end up in a state that’s worse than when they left. These transfers are often unnecessary. With virtual care, doctors could identify patients who need a consultation, then notify their regional hospital, helping to reduce unnecessary transfers. In this way, virtual care works as a kind of preventative measure by eliminating unnecessary transfers and the risks associated with them.

Sara Clemens, University of Toronto

I’ve worked as a nurse and as a health-care aide in long-term care facilities. I’ve worked as a director of care and I’ve worked in policy and research for LTC homes. Certainly, low staffing and lack of resources is a major concern for this sector. This has been a problem for decades, but it’s become especially obvious during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We need to look at alternative models. Some of the recommendations for adequate staffing levels at these homes come from reports that are 20 years old. They’re outdated and don’t reflect our current reality. We’ve become accustomed to having fewer registered nurses in LTC homes, while we’ve seen acuity go up, meaning that people are coming into LTC homes with more illnesses, more medications and closer to death. So, although we’re seeing that individual residents need multiple people taking care of them, the number of registered nurses in these facilities have gone down.

Our government will feel the economic repercussions of this pandemic for a while, so we shouldn’t expect them to start pouring money into better funding for senior care. Instead we need to cost our solutions. We need to consider how many beds we can actually afford and then fund those beds at 100 per cent quality of care instead of underfunding more beds.

We need to look to robots and automation, and how they can be part of the solution. Our workers are overwhelmed physically and mentally. Automation that helps do certain aspects of their jobs — giving medication, assessing pain — will help staff infinitely. This way, we can stop tying quality of care to staffing levels and consider other factors that will help.

Meghan McMahon, University of Toronto

The pandemic has put a spotlight on the immediate and long-term problems facing LTC homes. There are at least three major issues we need to address in order to get back on track: pandemic preparedness, the regulatory framework and staffing levels, and investment in data and research.

We need to address pandemic preparedness in long-term care homes. We need to learn what went wrong in Ontario, what went right in other jurisdictions, and to have plans and the capacity in place to ensure the devastation that unfolded here doesn’t happen again. This means full-time pay and benefits for workers, PPE for all staff, capacity to isolate and cluster, and ways for family members to visit loved ones while maintaining safety in the home.

We also need to look closely at the legislation and regulatory frameworks that underpin this sector. We often hear criticism that senior care is the most heavily regulated sector — but it’s also underregulated in some ways. There are very few requirements, for example, on the supply and skill mix of staff in facilities. In Ontario, LTC homes are required to have a registered nurse on duty 24/7, but the rest of the staffing supply and skill mix is left to the individual facility to decide. Our staffing levels in Ontario are considerably lower than international recommendations, and this is in the context of a population that is elderly, frail and has increasingly complex care needs.

Lastly, we need to invest in data and research. We need data to help us understand what’s happening on the ground, which interventions are working for whom and where the gaps in quality care are. While we have publicly reported data on quality of care at LTC homes, we don’t have quality of life indicators. We don’t adequately capture things like resident experience or satisfaction with care. If anything, the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on resident isolation has revealed the importance of assessing and monitoring these issues. If we don’t have this data, we’re hindered in our ability to design effective systems.

Research is needed to inform the design and implementation of LTC solutions, drawing on the evidence of what’s worked and what’s failed elsewhere. We have a talented health research community in Canada and their skills can be harnessed to help fix LTC homes in the future.

Aaron St. Pierre, Laurentian University

Irrespective of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are several major problems facing senior care in Ontario. One of the biggest has to do with staffing and recruitment; there aren’t enough people taking care of the elderly.

In Ontario, we have a minimum wage for PSWs that’s a few dollars higher than standard minimum wage. Plenty of PSWs make little more than those amounts. So that’s one huge barrier that dissuades people, especially young people, from pursuing a career in this area. Given the work PSWs have to do — taking care of people at their most vulnerable — they deserve to make much more.

Organizations across the sector also need to think about how they recruit. Going to universities and colleges, doing the leg work to bring in more young people, would help significantly. Nursing students and even PSW students are not always aware of the jobs that might be available to them. Going directly to these places, informing students of their job options, would help resolve some of these major staffing issues.",[],1216,0.916065340857173

Finally putting the needs of people first,'Joseph Hall',2020-06-25 00:00:00,"Pain fades. But trauma stays.

It follows us down roadways and sidewalks, into our schools and neighbourhoods — it changes the very infrastructure of our lives.

The legacy of social trauma left by COVID-19 will do this quite literally, experts say, shaping the way we plan and build Toronto and its surrounding regions over the coming decade.

“Overall what we have to do is get our minds around the fact that it’s not the ‘things’ that matter anymore, it’s the people,” says James McKellar, a real estate and infrastructure expert at York University’s Schulich School of Business.

“And we have to begin to understand that cities are for people and that we have done a terrible job in accommodating certain people,” McKellar says.

A more comforting, accommodating city, attuned to pedestrians and cyclists and less dependent on hurtling trains and beeping traffic, would be the best therapy for COVID-19’s trauma, McKellar and other city planning experts say.

It won’t be new-subway sexy.

Rather it means wider sidewalks, safer street signals and crossings, neighbourhoods filled in with “gentle development,” better parks and hundreds of additional kilometres of bike paths and lanes.

It will also mean the eradication or fundamental alteration of the shameful long-term-care facilities we offer our elderly — places whose human warehouse horrors and pitiful staffing strategies the virus so vividly exposed.

And all together — due to the need for closer, safer communities and the overcoming of crushing government debt that COVID-19 survival required — that means a scaling down of infrastructure projects and ideas as we move toward Toronto 2030.

“I’m not saying don’t build the transit and so forth, but let’s not assume that the big problems are going to be solved by big infrastructure,” McKellar says.

“In many ways, the problems are going to be solved by a lot of small things that just make the city more livable.”

This might mean something as simple as building more playgrounds, McKellar says.

Or, says Ryerson University’s Cherise Burda, it might mean something as radical as replacing a planned subway expansion with a far cheaper dedicated bus-route strategy; so-called bus rapid transit (BRT).

BRT provides buses with their own laneways, separate from those bearing automobile traffic.

“If we’re looking at limited resources (because of COVID-19 expenditures), there’s never been a better time to look at the business case for building transit infrastructure,” says Burda, head of Ryerson’s City Building Institute.

“And I think a really good example of that is the Scarborough subway. I know people don’t want to talk about that again, but that’s a $5-billion project,” she says.

Burda says that money would be better spent on building a vastly cheaper and longer bus rapid transit network — like the one that criss-crosses Ottawa — in Scarborough and other underserved areas of the city.

The three-stop Scarborough line could take 15 years to build; bus rapid transit routes could be moving before the decade is through, and provide faster transit along poorly served corridors like Jane St., Dufferin St., Steeles Ave. W. and Finch Ave E.

“And you could do all of that for less than the cost to build six kilometres of Scarborough subway,” Burda says.

She also says the city should more seriously pursue its existing cycling plan, updated last year, which would place every Toronto resident within one kilometre of a designated cycling path.

The University of Toronto’s Eric Miller, a planning and transportation expert, says many of the things on his list of infrastructure priorities would have been there pre-COVID-19, and that the virus has only highlighted their importance.

Like Burda, he would include far more buses, with underserved neighbourhoods in the city’s outskirts at the top of the list.

“We’ve always been so fixated on, ‘Let’s build the big subway, let’s talk about spending tens of billions of dollars,’ ” says Miller, director of U of T’s Transportation Research Institute.

“But the really big impact we could have on improving travel in this region ... is much better surface transit,” he says.

This would include in particular a far greater number of buses along existing roadways in the city’s suburban regions, running with traffic-signal priority to make them move more quickly, Miller says.

For people living some distance from bus stops, which tend to be on arterial roads in the suburbs, scheduled ride-sharing programs could take passengers the “first and last mile” of their daily commute, he says.

“The importance of transit has been highlighted by COVID-19, and we have this huge question of, ‘How do we move people if we can’t crowd them onto buses?’ ” Miller says.

He says expanded and faster bus service would allow people to more easily physically distance on the vehicles, and bring more equitable transit to areas where many of the essential workers who are bringing us through the pandemic live.

“And surface transit is something you can do ... in very short times,” Miller says.

“So over the next 10 years, we could dramatically improve how we deliver surface transit, particularly to places like Scarborough and Etobicoke, not to mention Mississauga and so forth.”

Miller’s infrastructure list for the next decade would also place decent, affordable housing near the top.

“We know we have a housing problem, certainly in the city of Toronto, more generally in the region,” he says. “And we talk about it, but we don’t do anything about it.”

The virus has only highlighted the perils of this inaction.

“In these COVID-19 days, where is the disease spreading? The disease spreads first of all where too many people have to ride buses (together), but also where too many people are overcrowded,” Miller says.

Packing large or multiple families into small apartments or houses is a key disease vector, Miller says.

And these tightly housed people are often among the essential workers who are lifting us through the current crisis.

“Hopefully we’ve come to appreciate how important, how essential these sorts of workers are — who we pay minimum wage and who we don’t orient our policies toward, whether it’s housing or transportation,” Miller says.

“COVID-19 is highlighting how important these things are and how inequitable in particular these things are.”

The inequities revealed by COVID-19 have been most stark and frightening in the region’s long-term-care homes, several of which have been decimated by illness and understaffing.

“It’s been a shambles clearly. The devastation that has occurred with COVID-19 in these homes is just heartbreaking, to say the least,” Miller says.

“Clearly that system is completely broken and needs complete reinvention,” he says.

The first order of business, Miller says, would be to shift the entire long-term-care system to the public sector, where much better oversight and wage and working conditions can be enforced.

On the infrastructure side, however, Burda says the homes must also shrink in size and be enfolded within local communities.

“Rather than warehousing seniors in big facilities in remote areas, we need to think about making them part of the neighbourhood,” she says.

“More facilities, better rooted in the neighbourhood, rather than bigger facilities far away.”

However it’s done, Miller says, better long-term care is a moral imperative.

“If nothing else changes five years from now, if we don’t have a vastly superior long-term-care system for the province, then shame on all of us, we have failed miserably,” he says.

Among other infrastructure considerations, McKellar says COVID-19 trauma has almost certainly ensured people will be more comfortable gathering outside rather than indoors for the foreseeable future.

And that means Toronto should launch European-style projects to reclaim roadways from cars — either permanently or periodically — in many parts or the city.

“What you find in Europe is that on a nice day a whole area of the road gets taken over by seating,” he says.

“We’ve already said the car gets about 50 per cent of the city and we get the rest. Well, we might not be able to give the car 50 per cent any more.”

A fluid transition from cars to patio seats on the roadways might also require getting rid of sidewalk curbs, as some European cities have done, McKellar says.

“We’ve chopped the city up and said, ‘Well, even if there are no cars on the road you can’t go on the road, it’s called jaywalking,’ ” he says.

“So we’re going to have to change our attitude toward the public environment and small things. Like, on every street, do we really want those big curbs is something we’ll have to decide.”

McKellar also sees the potential to bring amenities closer to the mental comfort of our homes through a better, more intense use of the city’s school sites.

“Another example I would use is the stupidity of school sites ... we have huge assets in the school systems,” he says, noting that many of these sites could accommodate far more city services.

“We’re still in silos, where we build a library, we build a school, we build a health centre. Why can’t we start to put those things together and make it convenient for people?”

Indeed, McKellar sees such integration as a partial solution to the long-term-care crisis — especially for facilities that offer retirement-home levels of care.

“Right now, the models that we use is old people go to old folks homes, children go to daycare centres,” he says.

“Well, my mother was at a home in Calgary where the daycare centre was in the seniors home, and it brought such life and joy to those seniors.”

Burda says neighbourhoods could also become more self-sufficient and livable by supporting locally focused infrastructure like cycling lanes and “gentle” lowrise development to fill in the city’s existing residential neighbourhoods.

She says Toronto should pursue sidewalk, bike route and development projects that would place everyday needs like groceries, medical care and schools within 15 minutes of every resident.

Small-bore infrastructure projects such as intersection and crosswalk improvements that make it easier and safer to travel on foot — as laid out in the city’s Vision Zero plan — would help in this quarter-hour goal, Burda says.

McKellar says a reluctance to build things like integrated school and library nodes or smaller-scale infrastructure was often based on a desire to maximize the economic stimulus that public works could provide.

“But let’s not use (that) excuse, let’s go back and use the infrastructure we have and make it more people friendly,” he says.

“And all the new infrastructure should exemplify new ways of thinking that put people back in the equation.”

Such smaller-scale infrastructure building would also be easier on a hugely depleted public purse, as governments climb out of the fiscal canyon that COVID-19 continues to dredge.

There is a huge reserve of private capital, especially within big pension funds and the like, that is eager to fund new for-profit infrastructure, McKellar says.

“For example, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is heavily investing in charging stations for electric vehicles,” he says.

“There is something that is going to have a huge environmental benefit if we can entice more and more people into it. Electric buses would be another one.”

Miller says the promotion of electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed to support them across the city and beyond would be a major step in the fight against climate change — an even more existential threat than COVID-19.

“We have to keep our eyes on what’s coming down the pike, and what’s coming down the pike is climate change,” he says of our infrastructure planning.

“We’ll be able to get our buses, but the buses may be underwater because the roads keep flooding.”

Private institutional capital could also flow into new and better data delivery if — as some expect — governments choose to regulate such systems, McKellar says.

“I think we’re coming to the point where we’re saying, ‘Shouldn’t this be a regulated utility?’ ” he says.

“And if it is a regulated utility, a pension fund would say, ‘That’s perfect for us, we’ll build a system and the government will set the rate.’ ”

Of course any infrastructure planning for the city and beyond depends on getting the virus under control.

And though people are optimistic that a vaccine or effective therapy will be found in the near future, COVID-19 could linger for years.

“Right now, we just don’t know,” McKellar says.",[],2006,0.9295761829812212

Four urban planning students share their solutions,'Jacob Lorinc',2020-06-04 00:00:00,"Toronto is among the 10 most expensive housing markets in the world. Between 2016 and 2019, the GTA added more than 325,000 jobs and only 102,000 new homes — only two per cent of which are considered affordable.

For many, the prospect of living comfortably in the city’s downtown has become a pipe dream, especially for students who find themselves increasingly unable to afford the cost of living that accompanies life within city limits.

The Star asked four urban planning students to offer their solutions to Toronto’s housing crisis. One common theme connected their visions — housing must be seen as a human right accessible to all, and not as a commodity for developers to maximize profits.

As a kid growing up in co-operative housing in Cabbagetown, I always assumed I was living in a normal apartment building. I didn’t know what “co-operative housing” meant or how it was any different than any other type of housing. When I grew older and became more interested in urban planning, I realized that, partly, this was because of the democratic decision-making structure and investments put into the housing where I lived.

To improve housing in Toronto, governments need to provide housing affordability in perpetuity and invest more in the quality of life for residents. At the co-op where I grew up, our housing had summer day camps, field trips for Easter, Halloween parties and annual Pride parties. These kinds of housing models were developed and financed throughout the 1970s to 1990s, and show how innovative a model like this is for building mixed-income communities.

We can look to models like the one used in the city of Amsterdam for inspiration, where the city requires a high percentage of low-income and moderate-income housing to be included in every new development. Not only does this make the city more affordable, but it helps to remove the stigma often associated with affordable housing — it’s just a normal way of life that the government helps facilitate. It underscores the reality that housing is a human right.

The financialization of real estate and housing poses a big problem in Toronto. Since the global financial crisis of 2008, real estate investment trusts have increasingly pursued residential and commercial property to yield financial returns to their investors, rather than focus on providing adequate living conditions for their tenants. That’s why we’re seeing renovictions, rent hikes and other tactics designed to maximize profit, and that’s why the people who play a fundamental role in our society — essential workers, including taxi drivers, grocery store workers and other service providers — are being pushed outside the downtown core.

There’s no one strategy that will solve the affordability crisis — nothing’s a silver bullet. A multipronged approach is the only way to address this.

By adopting models like community land trusts, where non-profit organizations acquire and preserve land for community benefit, we can help bring down the high costs of housing. Land trusts remove property from the speculative market in perpetuity, so it can stay affordable. The recent collaboration between housing groups, the City of Toronto and developers in the Bloor-Dufferin neighbourhood could be an interesting model to adopt moving forward, as the developers have agreed to contribute several million dollars to an affordable-housing land trust. Partnerships like these can be used to secure permanent affordable housing as part of new development projects.

To understand what’s going on today, we need to look at Toronto’s affordability crisis with a broader lens and understand the history of urban planning and housing in Canada. Right now, we’re seeing the negative impacts of decades worth of defunding and divestment from federal and provincial governments throughout the 1980s and 1990s. If we think about Canada’s colonial history, including ongoing practices of settler colonialism, and how its planning resulted in racialized segregation, we can understand why there are two sides to Toronto — one that’s highly concentrated with low-income and racialized communities living in affordable housing complexes, and the other that’s full of well-off people living in higher-income neighbourhoods, most of whom aren’t impacted by the housing crisis we so often talk about.

This is why all three levels of government need to step in. We can’t have livable affordable housing without governments that are willing to help.

A lot of our public housing stock is in bad condition. Years of defunding and divestment have led to an endless backlog of repair and maintenance needs. If we want to create better affordable housing in Toronto, we need to make significant investments in repairing and maintaining those buildings.

We also have to build affordable housing in different areas of the city. Toronto is filled with concentrations of poverty, where low-income residents are kept in secluded parts of the city. The city can create mixed-income neighbourhoods that include lower-income housing with new development projects at greater depths of affordability. People who work in lower-paying jobs downtown shouldn’t have to commute from Etobicoke or Scarborough because they can’t afford rent downtown.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how different life can be in Toronto depending on where you live. The virus spreads through clusters of low-income neighbourhoods while higher-income residents in secluded neighbourhoods mostly avoid it.

Our governments create policies that suit those who can profit from housing. We’ve seen inclusionary zoning rolled back, and regulations around rent control removed. Now, younger people who can’t afford the downtown are forced into the suburbs, creating longer commute times and offering fewer amenities. Ultimately, housing in Toronto is seen as a commodity when, in reality, we should see it as a human right.

We can look to cities not too different from our own, like New York City, for new approaches to changing the way we think about housing. Its community land trusts, for instance, are community-owned, community-operated and take land off the speculative market. They function as non-profits: all rent goes into maintenance, repairs and similar necessities that benefit the tenants.

Though they’re largely community-run, we still need the city and all levels of government to fund initiatives like community land trusts. The government is particularly helpful for land acquisition costs and with reducing property taxes on these places. Of course, New York City has no shortage of housing problems, but the models it has adopted are ones we should adopt, too. And ideally, we should expand these projects significantly.",[],1110,0.9439082708432823

Their family lives in Toronto’s High Park area, renting a place for $1,830 per month. They had to find it quickly — they were kicked out of their previous apartment when the landlord’s daughter needed a place to stay after university.

“(We) really struggled to find an apartment that fit our budget that could accommodate Jake being six-foot-two,” Amy says. “We ended up paying way more than we wanted, but we don’t plan to stay long.”

With no debts, they have dreams of buying a home outside the Greater Toronto Area to start their family. But recently Amy suffered health problems that prevented her from returning to work after the pregnancy.

Now, they live on a single income of $70,000 — earned by Jake who’s a software developer. “We live a very modest lifestyle, but things are still tight living on one income,” she says.

On top of the goal of buying a home within two to five years, the couple is also hoping they can start an Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) for their baby. They say that they’re not big spenders and make frugal day-to-day choices to boost their savings.

“We try to home cook as much as possible,” says Amy. Breakfast and dinner are almost always made at home. For lunches, Jake takes leftovers to work, but occasionally grabs a sandwich to go or heads to a restaurant with colleagues. Sometimes, with his stressful work schedule, he’ll opt for a snack from the vending machine.

At home, Amy’s schedule is also jam-packed. With the doctor’s checkups, taking the baby to free play groups, walking the dog and grabbing groceries, the errands can pile up.

On the weekend the couple have a bit more time to indulge their interests, such as geocaching — an outdoor activity using GPS to play hide-and-seek with containers marked in specific locations — and taking part in free community events with the baby.

The two want to move out of their expensive rental spot soon and hope a financial adviser can provide some clear direction on how to start.

We asked them to share everything they bought in a typical week:

The advice: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners, says it sounds like Jake and Amy are having a tough time financially with the decrease in income due to Amy’s health problem and the added stress of a new baby to provide for, coupled with a new, more expensive rental. Here’s his advice:

> Living outside the GTA could have a big impact on their cost of living. There are surrounding suburbs and towns with considerably lower real estate prices. The potential commute into the GTA is a real consideration, though. There’s a cost to that — both literal and figurative — especially when you’re raising a family.

> Amy’s health problems highlight a real risk for them. What happens if something prevents Jake from working? They’re paying health premiums, but don’t appear to have life or disability insurance — they should get on that.

> I’d also question the health premiums. They’re paying out of their bank accounts, so this makes me think it’s not a company or group plan, but rather an individual health insurance plan. I’d take a close look at what is actually being covered currently, and what could actually be covered based on the plan maximums.

> The RESP is a great idea for their little one. That said, given cash flow is tight, and their child isn’t even a year old, I’d maybe hold off for a while. RESPs provide 20 per cent government grants on your contributions up to $2,500 per year. But you can catch up on a full previous year in a future year.

> They may not have a car payment now, but they will eventually have to budget for a replacement. Especially if they move outside the GTA.

> Despite the common advice to start saving for retirement while you’re young, I’d really be focused on getting through these lean years with a newborn and hopefully getting Amy back to work and getting into a cheaper rental.

Overall, there are pros to the way they are living, Heath says. “Good on them for cutting costs with mostly home cooking. Their minimal spending on coffees and lunches will help keep their expenses low at a time when their cash flow is tight.”

The results: They actually spent more in the second week (but it was the holidays!) Spending in week 1: $611.16. Spending in week 2: $821.45.

What she thought: Amy and Jake say that despite spending more, they did “quite well” seeing as it was the holiday season — therefore gifts galore! “This week was a bit unusual for us leading into Christmastime with buying gifts for family, drinks for a Friendsmas party and extra gas for driving to our parents’ houses.”

Take-aways: Being a cautious pair, the couple says that Heath’s advice helped affirm several things they were already hoping to do. First, they’ve decided to cancel their health insurance after crunching the numbers. Also, following the advice, they’re holding off on the RESP contributions for the baby until they have more cash flow.

Another big change? They’ve moved up their timeline to leave Toronto. “We love it here, but it really doesn’t make financial sense to live here anymore, especially now that Jake has five years of post-university work experience and can apply to a wider range of jobs in less expensive cities,” Amy adds.

After doing the #MillennialMoney challenge, they say it was reassuring to find out that they’re doing a good job of limiting their spending. “It’s nice to have an expert affirm things that we felt in our gut.”",[],993,0.9312324419938639

With a bit of time and effort, you can be — and it will almost certainly lead to a stronger financial position. Here are five ways to become money smart:

Make a date with yourself every week to work on your finances

Financially literate people spend at least 20 minutes a week learning about money matters and staying on top of their finances. They read about wealth, meet with advisers, work on their budget and pay bills.

Whether they like the subject of money or not, immersing themselves in financial learning every week helps the financially literate stay on top of financial goals.

Carve out time every week to start learning about money. There are literally thousands of free resources online, and hundreds of documentaries to watch. Start with a search about how to save more money.

Investigate lenders before committing to one

In a recent survey conducted by Loans Canada, nearly 40 per cent of respondents — all of whom were already indebted — skipped out on comparing offers from lenders.

Unfortunately, loan stacking — having multiple loans from multiple vendors — tends to be a result of not being strategic about what you borrow for, and from which lender. And that stack of debt can be tough to handle efficiently.

Comparing loan terms, rates, frequency and amount of payments allows you to make an informed decision and gives you leverage to negotiate with competitive offers. And it’s fairly easy to do through online loan and rate comparison websites.

Work your budget

A 2019 Government of Canada financial capability survey found that Canadians who stick to a budget — about half of those surveyed — are better able to stay on top of their spending. People who budget also tend to have squirreled away enough savings for emergencies and retirement plans.

One of the biggest barriers that non-budgeters say gets in the way is a lack of time. There are, however, hundreds of digital tools to speed up the process compared to even a decade ago. And if you prefer to keep your banking separate from your budget, you could use a free Google budgeting template.

Keep a pulse on your credit score

Financially literate people keep an eagle eye on their credit score to prevent fraud and to monitor their progress toward improving it. Generally speaking, a score less than 600 is suboptimal with 900 being the highest. Paying bills on time and in full and reining in your credit cards is the best way to improve your credit score.

And there are plenty of free credit score tracking services like CreditKarma.

When it comes to your personal finances, never guess. There’s just too much at stake. If you don’t know what to do about your finances, or you are just unsure, get help.

Having low financial self-awareness is dangerous and generally leads to poor money decisions. Working with a professional, even if it’s just for the short-term, can help improve your financial self-awareness and increase your financial literacy.

Can they afford a home?",'Evelyn Kwong',2020-03-02 00:00:00,"Emily and Tom are both 26 years old. Emily, a registered nurse makes $69,000 a year, while Tom, an apprentice tradesman, makes $44,000. Their monthly spending adds up to around $6,000, and the $300 to $800 left over goes straight into paying off debt.

“We’re looking to buy a house ASAP,” Emily said. What’s the rush? The couple, who currently rent a home in Scarborough, just found out they’re expecting.

“Ideally we’d settle in Whitby, but our budget for homes is under $300,000,” she said. The two also say London is a good option to look at, but before real estate becomes a reality, Emily still has to pay off $12,000 in OSAP debt and Tom has to pay off $5,000 remaining of a consolidation loan from a fitness membership that went wrong.

“Hopefully we can pay it off by the middle of next year,” Emily said, adding they are eager to start their family life.

They’ve tried to be frugal to make their dreams a reality. In a typical workday, Emily and Tom pack a lunch. Emily will treat herself to a Starbucks drink three times a month while Tom buys a coffee and breakfast once a week. “Also, we both eat out from a fast-food restaurant once or twice a month.”

On the weekends, the two are typically homebodies unless they’re going to a friend’s house. Also for their date nights, they try to find ways to budget. “We never go out to drink, we go on dates maybe once every three months and typically spend just shy of $100 per date with food included.”

Their two largest monthly spends? $1,695 split between the two of them on rent, more than $700 on car insurance, about $550 on groceries and $400, which is non-negotiable, for charity.

On top of their more realistic goals, the couple is hoping to finally go on vacation for the first time. “We’d also like to go to either Disney World, Ireland, or the Caribbean for our first vacation sometime in the next few years,” Emily says.

We asked the couple to send in a sample of their weekly expenses for a #MillennialMoney expert to examine. Here’s what happened.

The expert: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners Inc., has advice for the couple, who he says, has an exciting year ahead.

> It sounds like the home budget is pretty modest at $300,000. They will need a minimum 5% down payment or $15,000.

> As they are considering a home purchase, remember that with babies come changes in income and expenses. I’m sure some sort of a parental leave for one or both of them will reduce their combined income for a period of time. EI maternity and parental benefits will replace only a portion of their incomes.

> I would focus the extra $300 to $800 leftover cash each month on Tom’s consolidation loan. It is likely the interest rate is higher than Emily’s OSAP loan rate.

> Debt repayment may be a better option than investing given the interest rates they’re paying, especially given their time horizon for a home purchase seems short. It’s not wise taking risk to invest if you may need your money in a short period of time.

> One thing to consider while Emily is off work is she may have the opportunity to buy back service in her pension plan. This is often a good opportunity to take advantage of and she should consider it during or after her maternity leave.

> Having a baby is a good time to re-evaluate insurance coverage and estate planning. Both Emily and Tom may need more life insurance. If they don’t already have wills and powers of attorney, they should consider them in advance of their new addition to the family.

> It’s hard to criticize generous philanthropists, but this couple should consider whether an expected decrease in income and increase in expenses should cause them to reconsider their $400 per month in donations, even if it is just temporarily.

The results: They spent less. Spending in week 1: $2,262. Spending in week 2: $551.91.

What Emily thought: Compared to last week, the couple is proud of how little they spent. “We will save from there,” Emily said. Next goals: “We’d like to reduce spending on snacks and coffee.” Added bonus, Tom will no longer need to use the 407 toll to go to work as he did in week 2, which will mean more savings.

Take-aways: With help from the Millennial Money expert, now Emily and Tom have shifted into looking more seriously into how to buy a home. “We will likely have to rent to save up for a down payment and maybe will need to pay off debts before purchasing a house as well,” Emily said.

In addition to that, the two had already planned to transfer any child tax benefits into an RESP, so they were glad to hear this affirmed by the financial coach as the “best investment strategy.”

Despite the desperation to pay off debts, the couple agree their charitable contributions are still not debatable, and that they will continue to give just as much.

Instead, they’ve found different areas to save money. “Emily’s family lives here, and they have offered child care which would offset child care costs with her return to work,” Tom added.

How can she prepare for the future?",'Evelyn Kwong',2020-07-13 00:00:00,"Editor’s note: This week features a special Gen Z edition of #MillennialMoney.

At 19, third-year nursing student Priya faces a lot of uncertainties about her future. In the back of her mind, she’s thinking about how she’ll pay off her accumulating student loans, which are especially high because of her field.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, she’s been studying from her home near Milton and not from the student residences where she usually lives and pays rent.

Priya has kept her job working at a cafe throughout the pandemic, making around $1,000 a month working just weekends.

The cafe is near her family home, so before COVID-19 she took transit to and from school Friday afternoons and Monday mornings.

“When it’s good traffic, it’s about an hour one-way,” she says. Other days the commute could take an hour and a half to two hours, twice a week. “That’s around three hours of my time that I could be studying or having some time to myself between constant studying, school, classes and work,” she says.

That’s why she’s hoping to purchase a car — once she gets her licence. “Once I get my G2, I want to eventually get a car, which would cut those commute times. But that also comes with insurance and gas expenses too,” she says.

On a typical school day, she’ll pack a lunch of leftovers from the dinner she cooked the night before. “I will do all my groceries for the week with my parents when I go home on the weekend and then cook for myself all week,” she says.

Now that it’s a summer, Priya is working weekdays and weekends, but she very rarely packs a lunch for her work shifts. “I usually eat food from work, for free.”

With lockdown restrictions loosened, after work she’ll hang out with friends at home, go for food, bubble tea or coffee, or watch a movie at a friend’s house to keep costs low.

Priya wants to start saving to be better prepared to tackle her OSAP when she graduates in two years, but with the hurdles of maintaining her grades, keeping a job and commuting, she needs some direction.

We asked Priya to share her daily spending to get a better idea of her financials.

The expert: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners Inc., shares some advice for Priya.

Priya is living pretty lean as a student with a part-time income of about $12,000 per year. She is doing all the right things now from a spending perspective by keeping discretionary spending low, packing lunch during the school year and cooking so she has leftovers. She’s lucky to be able to eat for free at work. Credit cards can be pretty enticing to other young people in her position as a means to supplement spending. She has done well to live below her means.

I note she comes home from school in order to work on the weekends. One way for her to boost her cash flow could be to find work closer to where she rents and goes to school so she can pick up a few hours of work during the week more easily without having to commute to work. Rent eats up 60 per cent of her income, so she doesn’t have much left to spare.

She has lots of OSAP student debt to pay back, but as long as she has at least 60 per cent of a full course load her loan should be interest-free. Any extra cash she can save in the interim should be deposited to a Tax Free Savings Account so whatever interest she earns is not subject to tax. An RRSP account would not be appropriate for her, as her income is so low that it is tax-free, making RRSP tax deductions useless for her right now. I would keep her savings in a TFSA or very conservative investment with little to no exposure to stocks. She could need her savings on short notice, so that does not lend itself well to riskier long-term investment options, despite the potential temptation.

When Priya completes school, OSAP repayment becomes a more enticing option for extra cash flow. This is because the potential return she can earn on saving and investing may not be as high as the interest rate on her OSAP loan, especially for conservative or even moderate risk investment options.

Once she gets her G2 licence and can drive on her own, she wants to get a car. I remember that dream myself. G2 licences were introduced partway through the year I turned 16, so my friends with early calendar year birthdays got full G licences and could drive on their own without a parent. But the reality is that cars can be a luxury for even those working and earning a good living, let alone a young person with student debt. These days, ride-sharing services make it easier to get around and avoid the monthly payments to have a car at your disposal.

Result: She spent less! Spending in Week 1: $156. Spending in Week 2: $30

How she thinks she did: “This was pretty light!” Priya says. A big part of why? Ever since she started this exercise of recording her spending it’s made her much more conscious. “I am really trying to be mindful of the money I spend now that I can see it right in front of me.”

Also, living at home since pandemic restrictions has shown her that eating meals at home and working more — as it’s summer and she’s closer to work — helps save a lot of unnecessary costs.

She does note, however, that outside of COVID-19 times she’d be spending at least $100 more a week. “I’d probably be going out a lot more, which means more on food and drinks with friends,” she says.

Take-aways: After reading Heath’s advice on finding a job closer to school Priya has decided to live at home and commute to school daily instead of paying rent for student residence. “Rent was getting expensive,” she says. After doing the math, spending more on commuting made more sense especially if she can live and eat at home. “It’ll also give me more time to slow down and do things I want to do.”

Another realization? “A car is such a luxury.” Priya admits that even though she’ll have to take public transit more, she probably can’t afford a car for at least a year.

Finally, it’s time that she opens up a savings account. “I was never taught this during school and it is important because I know I’ll have a lot to pay back,” she says. She’ll be asking her older siblings for advice on a TFSA and how she can start preparing to pay off OSAP sooner rather than later.

Here are five smart ways to get it back,'Lesley-Anne Scorgie',2020-07-13 00:00:00,"Yes, we are all in this together, and we need to be kind and lenient with each other, but it is not greedy to ask for your money if someone owes you; especially if you need it.

At this point in the pandemic, nine times out of 10 the reason you haven’t got your money is because the person or business legitimately can’t afford to give it to you. But clearly documented creative alternative solutions can sometimes fix this problem. Here are a few tips to help get your money back.

Agree to a flexible payment plan

Get on the same page about the person’s or business’s timeline to have the money, then offer up a more flexible payment schedule such as three monthly instalments of $250. Chances are that a little more time will prevent you from losing money and help the borrower get back on their feet. To be clear, this solution does not require you to reduce, or eliminate, the debt, which could be very bad for your finances. It’s an extension.

Now might be the perfect opportunity to barter services

Does your debtor have a skill or service that could be of value to you? Painting, safe child-minding, meal preparation, gardening, photography, digital storefront setup, chiropractic treatments and such. Could a swap of services, rather than payment, resolve the debt? Typically this works well if the debt is on the smallish side, but I’ve seen it work when the money owed is in the thousands, too; a few months rent in exchange for a clearly scoped home improvement, for example. Note that this solution only works if you can afford to go without the cash.

Exchange something of value

Taking “collateral” up front when lending money is a common practice because it protects the lender from nonpayment. But, you can still ask for it after the fact. If both parties agree, this is a straightforward trade. For example, a motorcycle in exchange for an $8,000 debt, or a gently used MacBook in exchange for a $1,500 debt. Once the ownership is transferred to you, you can decide what to do next; sell it on Facebook Marketplace or Kijiji, keep it for your personal use or trade it.

Negotiate a reasonable time for your vendors to honour your deposit or credit

Deposits for events are tricky because they are typically non-refundable. But if the coronavirus has delayed your wedding, retirement party or other large event, most businesses will allow you to rebook for a future date, thus using your deposit. The same goes for credits — flight credits, pre-booked services like monthly waxing or gym memberships — all of these should be honoured at a future date.

The challenge here is whether the vendor with whom you have the deposit or credit has the staying power to make it through the pandemic and still honour their commitment to you. My advice is to keep in contact with them, and if it’s looking like they might be headed for bankruptcy see what you can do to negotiate getting your money back … before they close their doors.

Sometimes less is better than none

I’m not a huge proponent of reducing the value of the debt, but sometimes you have to, to get at least some money back. Let this be a last resort option. Don’t offer it up until all else has failed.

When you’re dealing with debt, vagueness is a recipe for small claims court. So if you want to keep the relationship healthy with your tenant, customer, small business or friend who owes you, you’ll need to remove all emotion and negotiate clear win-win solutions.

In the rare instance, nonpayment is malicious. A good example would be the improper withholding of child support. Or theft. In these cases, do not delay in seeking legal counsel or bring it to the attention of authorities.",[],657,0.9387016066649586

The COVID-19 pandemic is pushing every industry into the future and the investment industry is no exception.

Canadian investors are increasingly embracing the shift away from more expensive mutual funds and into lower-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to a report from the Investment Funds Institute of Canada, more than $18 billion has flowed into ETFs so far in 2020, compared to only $4 billion into mutual funds. As the stock market crashed and recovered in March, ETF investors stayed the course by investing $3 billion, while mutual fund investors panicked and sold more than $14 billion.

A big part of the growth in ETF assets has come from so-called robo advisers such as Wealthsimple, which automate the process and make it very easy for people to start investing in ETFs.

These robo advisers have only increased in popularity during the pandemic: Wealthsimple, for example, saw twice as many sign-ups in March of this year compared to last March. Not every robo adviser offers a socially responsible portfolio, but for those that do, approximately one third of new investors opt in. Up until now, most of the offerings were similar and offered a very loose definition of “socially responsible,” so I’m very happy to see Wealthsimple raising the bar.

I wasn’t impressed when Wealthsimple launched its first socially responsible portfolio in March 2016. The portfolio consisted of a mishmash of ETFs, all with different and often conflicting definitions of social responsibility. Wealthsimple itself admits that the original methodology left a lot to be desired. Thankfully, the company updated the portfolio in June by launching its own socially responsible ETFs, with lower management fees and a unique methodology.

With more than $5 billion of assets under management, it’s worth examining Wealthsimple’s new socially responsible portfolio to see whether it really lets people “invest in a better world” — or is just clever marketing?

Wealthsimple’s updated socially responsible portfolio is chiefly made up of two new ETFs: the Wealthsimple North America Socially Responsible ETF (ticker: WSRI) that includes Canadian and U.S. companies, and the Wealthsimple Developed Markets ex-NA Socially Responsible ETF (ticker: WSRD) that includes companies from Europe, Japan and Australia. Both ETFs trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange and use the same screening methodology to determine which companies are allowed in. WSRI charges an annual management fee of 0.2 per cent, while WSRD costs 0.25 per cent.

Contrary to some of the ETFs in Wealthsimple’s old socially responsible portfolio, the new ETFs explicitly exclude weapons manufacturing, defence contracting, tobacco, alcohol, adult entertainment and any company found to be in violation of the United Nations Global Compact (principles covering human rights, child labour and corruption). The new funds also exclude companies related to oil, gas and coal, making them fossil-fuel free. Additionally, the top 25 per cent of carbon emitters in each industry are scrapped, as are companies with fewer than three women or less than 25 per cent female representation on their boards of directors.

According to a 2019 report from Osler, a leading business law firm, just 39 per cent of TSX-listed companies have more than one female director on their board. That means Wealthsimple’s gender screen excludes roughly 60 per cent of Canadian stocks.

Even with all those screens, Wealthsimple’s new ETFs still include a number of companies that would raise eyebrows among many ethical investors. Its North American ETF includes Amazon, which is being sued by Canadian delivery drivers claiming unfair treatment; and Facebook, which is facing a growing boycott from advertisers unhappy with the social media giant’s hands-off approach to hate speech.

The fundamental problem with the “one-size fits all” approach to ethical investing that robo advisers and funds offer is that the methodology never goes far enough for some investors — and goes way too far for others. Wealthsimple has said that the new funds will continue to improve and evolve, so we could see something like a racial equality screen introduced (pretty please). But there are currently only 233 companies in both ETFs combined and I would expect additional ethical screens to keep reducing diversification.

Does the new portfolio, as advertised, let people “invest in a better world?” Well, not quite.

It does a good job of excluding problematic companies and it does include a handful of stalwarts on Corporate Knights’ list of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World, including McCormick. But the portfolio has lacklustre exposure to companies whose main business is providing sustainable solutions such as renewable energy, electric cars, green buildings and energy efficiency — all themes that are outperforming with good long-term growth prospects.

For example, in the WSRD fund, just 20 per cent of the companies have a significant line of green or sustainable products or services, according to the Corporate Knights Green Flag Database.

For the time being, investors who want to invest in sustainable solutions will need to incorporate additional products such as green ETFs or community bonds if they want their investment to have a positive impact.",[],869,0.9227551601361904

We’re not even close to that moment when it comes to Ottawa’s COVID-19 spending, but that feeling is starting to set in.

So far, deficit spending has reached $343 billion this year covering everything from wage subsidies and unemployment benefits to money for seniors, students, rent relief and loans to business.

It may look like some politicians believe we can spend our way out of the economic shock, recession, and, perhaps, depression headed our way.

But what if tax dollars aren’t the only way to free up much needed investment dollars? What if there was a way to encourage Canadians to use their own capital to provide stimulus and support Canadian business?

Wealthy Canadians and corporations are holding cash and there are few incentives for them to invest in private Canadian businesses.

While the 2008 global economic crisis hit the big banks hardest, today’s calamity has struck a death blow to small business with little in the way of assistance coming from Ottawa.

That’s not to say a few small loan programs haven’t been helpful; they just haven’t moved the needle, and many small business owners have been reluctant to take on the risk of additional debt.

A recent survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business found that 25 per cent of small businesses will close their doors if they sustain a 50-per-cent drop in revenue for a month.

Many Canadian business owners are already well past that point. This is a tragedy. Small businesses are the heart and soul of the Canadian economy.

If you are a successful small business owner who has built a nest egg over many years, it is unlikely you will double down during a pandemic and reinvest your savings to keep your business afloat.

If you are evaluating an investment in, for example, a tech company looking for additional capital, the risks have increased significantly.

Unlocking private capital would provide additional support from Canadians who are not only looking for a return, but are also emotionally invested in the business’s success.

We’ve seen grassroots, microscale economic support for small business in communities across the country, including from community crowdfunding platform Distantly.ca, which enables individuals to send funds directly to local businesses.

The platform was conceived to make sure Mainstreet was still open post lock down.

Businesses such as restaurants, salons and gyms, which are closing their doors daily, would benefit greatly from an incentive for Canadians to make a much bigger commitment with that support.

Small businesses have a desperate need for capital to invest in digital transformation, working capital, personal protective equipment and other modifications required to comply with new pandemic regulations.

If Canada is going to emerge from this crisis stronger and more resilient, we need tax policy to encourage Canadians to invest in our small businesses.

We are not looking for anything unique or groundbreaking here. A handful of Canadian provinces have tax policy that encourages private investment in small business. New Brunswick has the Small Business Investor Tax Credit program, the most generous in the country.

If you live in New Brunswick and invest in a small business, you get a personal income tax credit of 50 per cent of your investment up to maximum of $125,000 annually. Corporations, trusts, co-ops and local economic development agencies are entitled to similar benefits upon investment. In the last five years, the program has generated almost $450 million of investment, supporting 2,200 small businesses in New Brunswick.

The federal government needs a bold, game-changing tax policy that will encourage Canadians with capital, including small business owners, to step off the sidelines and invest in small business.

We must establish qualifying parameters that encourage small businesses to grow. We must set the bar high in defining “small business,” so we don’t discourage growth.

The U.S. does this well. Section 1202 of its tax code allows for tax-free capital gains of up to $10 million or 10-times the investment if it is in a private business with up to $50 million in assets.

It’s a bold idea. That is easy to implement, were Ottawa so inclined.

As New Brunswick did, the federal government could provide an income tax credit to Canadians for investment in small- and medium-sized businesses. Business owners who double down and reinvest in their own business, could get a tax holiday on income earned, or charge no tax on dividends paid, for up to three-times the invested capital. For investors looking to back potential high-growth entrepreneurs, the program could provide tax-free capital gains — up to tenfold.

Ottawa has the power to do all of the above.

High-income earners in Canada pay more than half of their income to the government, not including municipal and sales tax.

And if the pollsters in the States are correct, that’s exactly what is going to happen. Biden appears to have a wide lead at this point.

Of course, a lot can happen in four months. But if the status quo holds, what would a Biden win mean for investors and the Canadian economy? Potentially, a lot.

So far, the former vice-president hasn’t unveiled much in terms of his platform. But his first major policy statement sent shock waves through the oilpatch and cheered environmentalists.

In mid-May, the Biden campaign announced that one of his first acts as president would be to rescind the permit allowing TC Energy to build the Keystone XL pipeline. That action would kill the project once and for all.

President Barack Obama rejected Keystone on the grounds that it would contribute significantly to climate change. As his VP, Biden strongly supported the move, so it’s no surprise he would act quickly to reverse Trump’s approval of the project.

That would be a huge blow to heavy oil producers and to the province of Alberta, which is investing $1.5 billion to cover construction costs to the end of 2020. That’s a lot of tax dollars down the drain if Biden indeed pulls the plug.

The Keystone XL announcement is a clear tip-off to what else we might expect from a Biden presidency. It would probably be the greenest administration in U.S. history, especially if the Democrats are able to retain control of the House and wrest the Senate from the Republicans.

The Green New Deal put forward by the party’s left wing is a smorgasbord of ideas aimed at tackling climate change on a grand scale. Some of the proposals are probably unworkable, such as upgrading every building in the U.S. to meet specific environmental standards. But it is likely that a Biden administration would promote some of its key goals, including the use of green energy at the expense of fossil fuels, and subsidizing electric vehicles and low-emission high-speed trains.

Under Biden, the U.S. would almost certainly rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and we should expect a lot of reregulation in the environmental sector, reversing the deregulation of the Trump years.

Relations with Canada should improve significantly. Biden does not believe in using tariffs as a political lever. He and Prime Minister Trudeau share many of the same views and profess to be good friends.

In other areas, I would expect a Biden government to roll back some or all of Trump’s prized $1.5 trillion (all figures U.S.) in corporate and personal tax cuts. The plan was passed in 2017, when the Republicans still controlled the House. Not one Democrat voted for it.

The cuts provided a huge boost for corporate profits but, instead of investing the money in plants, equipment and jobs as the government hoped, billions were spent on share buybacks and raising dividends. That caused a backlash that extended to Capitol Hill and is still simmering.

The Trump administration was running a huge deficit even before the emergency spending for the pandemic. The Congressional Budget Office now projects a shortfall of close to $4 trillion this year. That means the cupboard will be bare if Biden takes office in January. What better way to start replenishing it than by rolling back those tax cuts?

Canada would be an indirect beneficiary if that were to happen as it would restore the tax advantage we offered to corporations before the Trump cuts.

How would stocks react to all this? If recent history is any indication, the markets would rise in the first year of a Biden presidency. That has been the pattern in every year but one since 1985. The exception was 2001, the first year that George W. Bush was in office, when Sept. 11 sent the market tumbling.

Stocks will not respond well to a boost in corporate taxes or an overaggressive climate policy. But they would get a big lift if a coronavirus vaccine is developed and an economic recovery appears to be underway if and when Biden takes office.

It’s Canada’s problem, too.

The range of potential harms to Canada include supply-chain disruptions and renewed American protectionist sanctions against Canadian industry.

That’s in addition to the hammer-blow the prolonged pandemic has already dealt to Canada’s vast tourism, hospitality and conventions sector, deprived of U.S. business and vacation travellers.

Americans getting sicker instead of healthier — opposite to what their northern neighbours have achieved — has so far not significantly diminished the roughly $1 billion in daily trade between the two countries.

But that changes if the “rocket-ship” economic recovery that U.S. President Donald Trump promised Americans last month fails to materialize, with U.S. elections just four months away.

A promising U.S. economic rebound from mid-April into June has stopped far short of full recovery. And some sectors, notably retail, are back in decline.

Fear of infection is keeping Americans out of stores that have reopened after lockdown. So is the lack of a second round of U.S. pandemic relief cheques, in sharp contrast to the continued flow of federal income supports in Canada and the European Union (EU).

Weakness in U.S. consumer sentiment will eventually inflict damage on Canadian online retail and business-to-business sales in the U.S. market. It will also harm Canadian firms doing business directly in the U.S., including Canadian banks, insurers, retailers and property developers.

If the stall-out in the U.S. economic recovery continues into the fall, the economic pain for Canada will spread from tourism and retailing into the Canadian manufacturing, resource and agricultural sectors.

Americans buy Western Canadian livestock, B.C. timber and almost every drop of Alberta oil. Demand and prices for each have already been weakened by the pandemic.

Economic conditions in both the U.S. and Canada are deeply worrisome.

The U.S. jobless rate in June was 11.1 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent just before the pandemic, and not far shy of the peak 11.9 per cent during the Great Recession of 2008-2010.

The Canadian jobless rate peaked at about 14 per cent in the second quarter, Bill Morneau, the federal finance minister, said this week. It is expected to fall back to pre-pandemic levels of about seven per cent by the end of next year.

The U.S. economy is forecast to shrink by about six per cent this year. Canada’s economy will shrink by 6.8 per cent, by the feds’ reckoning, before rebounding by about 5.5 per cent in 2021.

But Ottawa’s projections for a robust economic recovery are pinned on a strong U.S. rebound. A Canadian export-driven economy tied to the U.S. market will, of course, fail to reach those recovery targets if the U.S. pandemic continues to drain America of economic vigour.

In contrast to the pandemic progress made by many major economies, the U.S. continues to report record numbers of new COVID-19 cases.

Last month, Canada’s rolling seven-day average of daily new cases fell by 75 per cent.

In the U.S., it rose by 37 per cent, reaching all-time highs of 50,000 or more new daily cases this week. As Paul Krugman, the Nobel-laureate economist, pointed out last week, Arizona, population seven million, has been reporting more new daily cases than the entire EU, population 446 million.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infection-disease expert, warned this week that, at the current rate of growth in new U.S. cases, America could be reporting upward of 100,000 new COVID-19 cases per day.

The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that for every reported case of COVID-19, there probably are at least another 10 that have gone unreported. The U.S. already leads the world in reported COVID-19 cases and fatalities.

While many countries are preparing for an expected second wave of the virus, “We are still knee-deep in the first wave,” Fauci said.

It is troubling for Canada’s economic prospects that the Trump administration is in denial about America’s failed response to the pandemic.

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said this week that “The world is looking at us as a leader in COVID-19.” Trump himself said this week that COVID-19 will “sort of just disappear.”

That isn’t the view in California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, where COVID-19 appears to be raging out of control and hospitals are close to overcapacity with COVID-19 cases.

As to world opinion, a recent survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations found that just two per cent of European respondents believe the U.S. has been “helpful” in the fight against COVID-19.

Given the resourcefulness of Americans, one has to believe conditions will improve, just as especially hard-hit jurisdictions including South Korea, Germany and New York City were able to stop the spread.

But for now, Canada needs to brace for potential disruptions in U.S. supply chains.

For example, Canadian grocers should be looking now for alternatives to California and Florida in citrus supplies. These are largely harvested in those U.S. states by migrant labour more vulnerable to COVID-19 than the general population. Otherwise, Canadians might be hit this winter with higher prices for oranges and other citrus products, and the economy will suffer a rise in food-related inflation.

We also need to brace for a new round of Trump protectionism. With his re-election prospects gloomy, Trump has returned to launching trade disputes. Their purpose is to deflect attention from the pandemic and to show concern about a faltering economy.

That too is a worry for Canada.

Coming into 2020, there was some hope among Canadian lumber producers and the U.S. homebuilders they supply that America’s long-standing punitive tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber might finally be lifted.

Instead, the pandemic and Trump’s renewed protectionism have turned softwood lumber talks into dead letter. And the White House is musing about a renewed tariff assault on Canadian aluminum imports.

Canada is hardly the only target of Trump’s resurgent protectionism. His latest “America First” trade sanctions are also aimed at the EU as a whole, EU member Germany in particular, and Vietnam and other U.S. allies. All that against the backdrop of Trump’s trade war with China.

Even before the pandemic, U.S. trade disputes, since ramped up, were depressing global GDP growth.

“If the U.S. cannot get a handle on the virus, and if its leadership chooses a protectionist route to economic recovery, Canada’s return to normalcy will be that much harder,” Philippe Lagassé and Srdjan Vucetic, international affairs professors at Carleton University and the University of Ottawa, respectively, wrote recently.

With home prices set to soar at the start of this year, many would-be buyers went into lockdown feeling priced out and discouraged by heated bidding wars and bully offers.

Then COVID-19 sent Greater Toronto Area home sales tumbling 69 per cent year over year in April. Some consumers still hanging on to their salaried jobs read it as a signal that the window of opportunity was opening.

On a year-over-year basis, home prices have stalled, with the average price rising only about $1,000 in April to $821,392. Still, that was down about $90,000 from February’s average price of $910,319.

While there are some opportunities in the COVID-19 housing market, experts warn those come with risk, and timing the low point is tricky for buyers. Even if this is a once-in-a-decade chance to step on the property ladder, it may be slipping away as the economy sputters back to life.

The Star asked six experts — two economists, three real estate brokers and a mortgage specialist — if post-pandemic conditions will be first-time-buyer friendly, and whether a recovery will quickly shut down those opportunities.

Here’s what they said:

“The bottom is not falling out of the market, but it’s a better time for a first-time buyer probably than we’ve seen since 2009,” said Andrew Harrild of Condos.ca.

The year opened with bidding wars galore and homes commonly selling for 10 per cent over list price. Then in mid-March, when open houses were cancelled and condo buildings banned real estate showings, there were probably deals to be had amid the uncertainty.

But the market has since stabilized.

“You’re even starting to see offer dates creeping back in, which is certainly an indication people are feeling a bit more confident,” Harrild said.

“You’re not seeing massive discounts off the list price but you are seeing 98 per cent of list or $10,000 or $20,000 under asking,” he said.

The flip side is there isn’t much to see. Listings were down 64 per cent in April compared to the same month last year, with short supply putting upward pressure on prices and signs of pent-up demand.

“There’s a bit of confidence coming into the market,” he said.

If you are looking for a bargain you’ve got to drill down to individual neighbourhood and housing category, said Zoocasa CEO Lauren Haw.

She warned that sales statistics are skewed by the low number of sales and the mix of available properties on the market.

“Neighbourhood by neighbourhood, things are quite different,” she said.

There could be more choices for those in the market for a downtown condo. That’s where some short-term rentals have migrated to the long-term-rental and resale markets. But there are few detached houses available in good school districts.

“April-May is your crown month for family homes in good school districts and they’re not for sale right now. I continue to think when those houses hit the market we’re going to see prices rise,” Haw said.

There is some real estate excitement in the 905 communities around Toronto and that is extending to cities such as Hamilton, Peterborough, Barrie, London and Kitchener-Waterloo, markets that were thriving before the pandemic.

Now that many people don’t see themselves going back to work at the office full-time, Haw predicted those secondary cities will likely remain buoyant.

“If I am only going to commute three days a week, of course I’m going to buy a detached house in a great neighbourhood in Kitchener,” she said. But home buyers will continue to want walkable downtown lifestyles with restaurants and entertainment nearby.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said there are bargains to be had with homes selling for less than they were in March. But, he said, “There is a risk premium for trading in any financial crisis and frankly it’s justified because there are so many unknowns.”

That benefit of a sale price that is 2 to 5 per cent lower looks more substantial when you consider prices had been expected to rise as much as 15 per cent this spring, he said.

Soper also warned that the window for those savings will close as the market returns to normal, and there are signs that is already happening, with traffic up 20 per cent year over year at the company’s listings website royallepage.ca and an uptick in virtual and guided showings.

“The longer you wait the less an opportunity there will be for a cheaper purchase,” he said.

“In any market correction, buyers are the earliest to react to a potential downturn and adjust their expectations lower as far as price goes. Sellers are the last in and the first out,” Soper said.

Their usual reaction is to take their house off the market or test the market to see if they can get what they want, not let the house go at a significant discount.

“It appears that the 905 is doing better than the 416 during this recovery,” Soper said. “It may be a combination of lower average price and lower density — probably a citizenry that is somewhat less concerned about leaving their homes to transact, particularly in housing,” he said.

David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said he doubts few young adults 25 to 35 years are thinking about buying homes, with about 30 per cent having lost their jobs or the majority of their work hours since February.

“If you were in that age category and a third of your friends lost their jobs, you might be pretty reticent to take on a big mortgage because you might be next,” he said.

Several factors need to line up for buyers to take advantage of the recession, Macdonald said.

“You’ve got to be lucky enough to keep your job and we need to see big declines in house prices, which itself would be devastating to the economy because people would feel a lot poorer as a result of their houses being worth much less,” he said.

Macdonald said people who might have been saving for a house pre-COVID-19 are now likely more preoccupied with paying the rent.

“There may be people who benefit from this but in terms of allowing millennials en masse to buy single-detached homes in the GTA any time soon, I think that’s extraordinarily unlikely,” he said.

One sign the housing market could be quickly revived is that mortgage pre-approvals are beginning to pile up, said James Laird, president of CanWise Financial.

“It feels like just before the spring market right now where there is a few purchases happening but not many, but it does feel like people are readying themselves to possibly buy in the next couple of months,” he said.

While part-time and hourly workers have suffered disproportionate job losses during the COVID-19 crisis, only about 10 per cent of full-time workers have lost their jobs, Laird said.

“Typically it wouldn’t be the part-time, hourly person who is looking at entering the real estate market,” he said. “It’s more typically those with longer-term, stable employment, and that group has not been nearly as badly affected,” he said.

Conference Board of Canada senior economist Robin Wiebe said there are competing factors that could hasten or slow recovery. But on balance, he said, Toronto housing fundamentals can likely sustain a comeback.

“One of the things that might go against a quick rebound in the housing market is that consumers in general are carrying high debts. Even though rates are low they may not be prepared to jump into the housing market — that’s not just young people, that’s people of all ages,” Wiebe said.

But population is a big driver of housing demand and there are reasons to think Toronto has pent-up demand based on Conference Board estimates that the city added 128,000 people last year, on top of 125,000 in 2018. That’s the equivalent of two Census Metropolitan Areas (CMA) according to the Statistics Canada definition of 100,000 people, he said.

Until the shutdown Toronto also enjoyed “red hot” employment growth, rising over 4 per cent last year, and interest rates are low and expected to stay that way for some time.

That has contributed to pent-up demand and a short supply of housing. Wiebe cited Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) statistics showing there were 209 completed and unoccupied (ownership, not rental) apartments in the Toronto CMA in April. The 20-year average is 630.

Experts who spoke to the Star stressed there are still a lot of unknowns about the road to recovery.

What happens if there is a second wave of COVID-19 infection in the fall?

“A brief second wave I believe the market could manage, and people will treat it like the aftershock of an earthquake. An extended or more damaging second wave would mean all bets are off for the economy and the housing market,” Soper said.",[],1478,0.7416210171976099

The average selling price for homes also dipped 1.5 per cent to $819,665, according to a special mid-April market update released on Wednesday.

The board now expects home prices to finish out the year at 2019 levels, instead of the originally forecast $900,000 average.

Listing prices showed a similar drop in the first part of this month.

The board’s revised expectation takes into account a roaring 15 per cent year-over-year price gain in the first quarter. More recently though, COVID-19 restrictions have severely curtailed real estate activity, said board president Michael Collins.

“Home buyers and sellers have concerns about the economy and, indeed, their own employment situations. On top of this, many buyers and sellers are avoiding any type of in-person interaction. In the condo market in particular, individual condo corporations have curtailed entry for non-residents,” he said in a news release.

The board forecasts a return to housing activity if public health restrictions loosen in the summer, leading to an acceleration of sales in the fall. Some price declines could appear into the second and third quarters of the year, however.

“But these declines will have less of an effect on the overall price for 2020 because the annual share of sales will also be much lower than normal,” said a news release.

New listings went the way of sales, plummeting 63.7 per cent to 3,843 in the Toronto region between April 1 and April 17, a period that is traditionally part of the housing market’s busiest season.

When buyers get back in the market, there will be a pent-up demand for homes, said TRREB chief market analyst Jason Mercer.

“Increasingly those buyers will be faced with the persistent lack of listings inventory that was a serious problem before the (onset) of COVID-19,” he said.

The market update shows that detached house prices have taken the biggest hit, declining 9.1 per cent to $1.26 million on average in the city of Toronto. There was a drop in the number of homes that sold in the city for more than $2 million, bringing down the overall average, says the real estate board.

Across the Toronto region, detached houses sold for 4.6 per cent less year over year, averaging $990,543.

Even condos, which have consistently increased in value, saw a drop in the average selling price of 1.8 per cent to $578,594 in the GTA and a 2.9 per cent decline to $617,246 inside Toronto’s borders.

Shaun Hildebrand said that while construction has slowed, many residential building sites are still operating and will inject new supply into the rental market.

There are already signs of a shift in the Toronto area’s notoriously tight rental market, he said.

There were 7,200 units leased in the first quarter of 2020, a 16 per cent year over year increase. But there was a significant shift after March 16, Urbanation reports.

The year started with a 25 per cent year over year uptick in the number of Toronto-area lease transactions. But in the second half of March, rentals were 25 per cent below the same level the year before — down 39 per cent compared to the first half of the month.

The supply of rentals dropped only 7 per cent during the same period.

“That we saw some weakness in rents already, just two weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn, it just speaks to how quickly the market is starting to react,” said Hildebrand.

The changes represent a pretty dramatic shift and likely the beginning of what will be a pretty soft period for the rental market, he said.

Some 10,000 condos and 1,000 purpose-built rentals were expected to come on the market in the second quarter of this year, and while they will likely be delayed, most will be ready for occupancy later, said Hildebrand.

Residential construction sites are operating, albeit at a slower pace to allow for worker safety measures.

“On the demand side we have job losses, lower income, lower immigration. On the supply side we haven’t seen a lot of rental availability as yet but I think that will happen,” he said.

Job losses mean some tenants will move into roommate situations or back home. Hildebrand predicts fewer people will upgrade their apartment. But the introduction of new buildings means a large supply coming online at once and that can put downward pressure on rents.

Because most Toronto investment condos are owned by individuals rather than REITs or pension funds, those landlords will be motivated to rent their units and, because they bought at lower prices than condos sell for now, they will have some flexibility to lower their prices, he said.

Meanwhile, rental website PadMapper reported a 10 per cent drop in apartment searches between February and March.

Toronto remains the most expensive rental market in the country, according to PadMapper. The $2,250 average one-bedroom rent, was .9 per cent higher year over year in April. Two-bedroom rents rose 2.8 per cent to $2,950 in the same period.

In its first-quarter report, released Tuesday, the brokerage says that if the pandemic recedes by the end of second quarter, prices could jump up 1.5 per cent year-over-year, to $856,263 by the end of 2020.

However, if the lockdown continues to the end of August, the company expects house and condo prices will contract by 0.5 per cent year-over-year to $851,982.

Although Toronto’s housing market had a strong first-quarter, with aggregate resale prices rising 7.5 per cent year-over-year, that won’t be enough to compensate for the loss of eight to 12 weeks in the busy spring real estate season, said Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper.

About 22 per cent of sales typically occur in the first quarter of the year.

“We’re not anticipating an immediate recovery,” he said.

Even when the economy begins to move again, people will still be wary of each other and sellers will be more hesitant to allow strangers to tour their homes.

But once consumers feel more comfortable, Soper said economic stimulus, such as low interest rates, competition among lenders and softer prices, will kick-start the market.

The “swift and violent” impacts of COVID-19 have disproportionately hit younger and part-time workers across the province, groups less likely to be in the housing market, he said.

That’s why the real estate sector will be one of the prime lifters of the economy when health protocols are relaxed, just as it was following the global downturn in 2008 and 2009, said Soper.

“It was really the entry of the first-time buyer and the housing consumer that brought the Canadian economy back after the great recession,” he said.

Soper said it may appear as if real estate prices have plummeted when the country goes back to work. There will be headlines touting dramatically lower selling prices. But those will likely be a few distressed sellers accepting lower prices that lower the overall average.

There will also be some opportunities for buyers who might otherwise have been faced with competitive offers — something that was a growing concern in the heated market of the first part of the year.

“One of the really challenging things we saw coming in 2020 before the health crisis, was the psychology of multiple defeats where you put an offer in and you lose and you lose and you lose. Eventually people either drop out (of the market) in frustration or they overpay. We should see a lot less of that,” he said.

The Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB) had been forecasting a 10 per cent rise in GTA housing prices this year before the COVID-19 restrictions stopped showings and stalled all but necessary transactions. The board has suggested that it will have a better idea of where prices and sales are heading later this spring.

Mortgage rates to fall following Bank of Canada rate cut,'Michael Lewis',2020-03-05 00:00:00,"Variable rate mortgage holders are the big winners from the Big Six banks’ moves to match the Bank of Canada’s 50 point reduction to its trendsetting interest rate.

According to rate comparison website RateSpy.com, variable rate customers will see rates drop by half a per cent for interest cost savings of roughly $500 per year for every $100,000 of mortgage.

Those with adjustable-rate mortgages will see monthly payments fall by about $24 per $100,000, while variable-rate customers will continue to make the same monthly payment but their portion directed to principal will rise while the amount paid in interest will fall. Home backed and regular lines of credit will drop as well.

All of this follows the Bank of Canada’s decision Wednesday to lower its overnight target rate by 50 basis points to 1.25 per cent — the lowest since the 2008 recession — due to fears of a deepening economic downturn caused by the coronavirus and after the U.S. Fed imposed an emergency 50-basis-point cut.

There had been expectations that the banks would not pass on the full BoC cut, but Canada’s largest bank, RBC, led the way Wednesday evening, announcing a 50-basis point reduction to 3.45 per cent for its prime rate effective Thursday, which is used to set the rate at which banks lend to customers with good credit.

The other big banks — Bank of Nova Scotia, TD-Canada Trust, CIBC and BMO followed suit with National Bank of Canada confirming Thursday that it will also lower its prime rate by 50 points to 3.45 per cent as of Friday.

Rob McLister, RateSpy.com’s founder, said the the lowest widely available variable rate will drop immediately to roughly 2.34 per cent from 2.84 per cent, while the 2.59 per cent rate for the lowest conventional five year fixed-rate mortgages will fall in the short term due the lower prime and downward movement in bond yields which normally signal falling mortgage rates. He said fixed rates will trend lower as economic data continues to soften, “but we’ll have to wait and see by how much.”

Many observers expect the Bank of Canada to announce another 25 point rate cut next month — possibly another quarter-point cut before the end of the year, which would bring Canada’s overnight rate to 0.75 per cent.

“The growing risk of COVID-19 to the outlook suggests that the Bank of Canada will follow today’s 50-bp cut in interest rates with an additional 25-bps cut in April,” said Stephen Brown of Capital Economics in a note. “Given lingering concerns that looser policy will boost an already red-hot housing market, however, we think the Bank is unlikely to go further than that.”",[],438,0.9424040882846666

Luxury condo prices climbed 7 per cent in the GTA in the 12 months ending Jan. 31, to a median price of $2.4 million. By comparison, high end houses, rose only 1.2 per cent to $3.6 million in the same period.

But Steven Green, a sales representative with Royal LePage Partners Realty, said he expects this year will see another jump in prices. He is predicting luxury condos to rise between 10 and 15 per cent in the next 12 months and houses to surge between 2.5 and 6 per cent.

The lack of new listings has continued to drive up prices this month, said Green. As an example, he cited a case last week where six competing offers drove the selling price of a condo near Yonge Street and Lawrence Avenue up by 36 per cent beyond asking.

“There’s no supply, so there’s five people looking to buy the same kind of product right now because they had no chance of buying this one,” he said.

Green, who has several Hollywood names among his clientele, says Toronto’s luxury market is being fuelled by the return of foreign buyers since last summer.

Property buyers from Asia and the U.S. are attracted by the city’s vibrant culture and relative safety, and have adjusted to the non-resident buyers tax introduced in 2017. Prices also came down in some areas such as Bayview Avenue and York Mills Road

“They look at real estate differently than we do. We always wanted to buy a house on the quiet street. They have changed the market and pricing for some areas because they want to be buying on the major street or close to the major street because they want the action,” he said.

Prices look high to Torontonians but Green said, “We’re still undervalued for major cities around the world.”

Empty nesters are typically looking for condos in their old neighbourhoods. Condos sell in Toronto for about $1,000 per square foot, he said. Many buyers are purchasing less square footage than they might actually like but they are purchasing for the area.

“So many people are looking for 1,800 sq. ft.-plus and that’s hard to find,” said Green.

Many of those are in Yorkville, the St. Regis at Bay and Adelaide streets and the Ritz on Wellington St. W.

Among Canada’s major cities, Montreal saw the highest year-over-year price appreciation in its luxury market in the year leading to Jan. 31 with 8.5 per cent for both houses and condos. A dearth of listings is also pushing prices there, with homeowners hesitating to list for fear of not being able to find another suitable property, said Royal Lepage. The company is forecasting the median price of luxury homes there to grow by 5.5 per cent for houses and 5 per cent for condos.

The online TV giant will start by shifting $25 million into the Black Economic Development Initiative, a new fund that will invest in Black-owned financial institutions serving low-income communities, and $10 million to Hope Credit Union. Going forward, the company will steer two per cent of its cash on hand, which currently amounts to about $5 billion, to financial organizations that directly support African-American communities.

News of Netflix’s commitment sent shares of Black-owned banks soaring Tuesday. Carver Bancorp Inc. jumped as much as 173 per cent in New York trading and Broadway Financial Corp. gained as much as 83 per cent.

Large U.S. companies have rushed to show support for African Americans following the death of George Floyd, one of several Black people killed by police in the past few months. Many businesses and rich individuals have pledged money to civil rights causes, including Netflix chief executive officer Reed Hastings, who earmarked $120 million of his personal fortune to historically Black colleges and universities. But his company wanted to propose a solution that addresses more systemic causes of inequality.

Hope Credit Union serves more than 1.5 million people in states including Alabama and Louisiana, but it doesn’t have enough money to fully support the financial needs in its communities, according to its CEO, Bill Bynum.

“We are capital-starved, just like the people in the communities we serve,” Bynum said. “Having a global voice like Netflix say it’s important to invest in financial institutions like Hope is tremendously important, not just for the capital we will use to make mortgage loans and small business loans, but for what it says.”

One employee

Netflix executive Aaron Mitchell came up with the idea of shifting money into Black-owned banks following an April dinner with leaders from different under-represented groups. Netflix has been hosting these dinners since October in an effort to improve diversity at its highest levels and inform its top executives.

Mitchell pitched the idea to chief financial officer Spencer Neumann and began conducting research, reaching out to banks and reading “The Color of Money,” Mehrsa Baradaran’s book about the racial wealth gap. After Floyd’s death, he sent his proposal to Hastings, who expedited the project.

“I have talked to a lot of companies, but this is the first company that’s actually done something about it,” Baradaran said.

Netflix hopes the move will inspire other large U.S. companies to do the same, Neumann said. The streaming service has a small cash pile relative to Silicon Valley peers Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. If every company in the S&P 500 shifted just one per cent of its cash to Black-owned financial institutions, it would translate into more than $20 billion, Netflix said.

Netflix record

Netflix has a lot of work to do on its own. The company has no Black executives among its eight top officers, and added its first Black board member in 2018. It ranked toward the bottom of the pack last year among Hollywood studios in terms of hiring women directors, according to the Directors’ Guild of America.

But the guild ranked the company first in adding people of colour, part of the progress it has made since hiring Verna Myers as its head of diversity and inclusion in 2018. She aided programs such as Strong Black Lead, which highlights projects with African Americans in lead roles. Black employees now make up seven per cent of Netflix’s overall employee base, up from four per cent three years ago. The number of Black vice presidents has tripled to nine over the same span.

“We have been on this journey now for at least the last three years,” Mitchell said. “We still have lots of work to do, but we are making meaningful progress.”

The new policy on voting announced Friday by chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg means Facebook will label future posts from U.S President Donald Trump, and everyone else, about mail-in ballots or other voting-related issues, regardless of whether they contain misleading information. Facebook will funnel users to a voting information hub meant to provide facts from state authorities. Users will also be able to register to vote using this hub. Facebook has set a goal of helping register four million new voters before the 2020 U.S. election in November.

“There are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies I’m announcing here today,” Zuckerberg said.

The social network has been criticized in recent weeks for allowing false or misleading voting information, including posts from Trump about mail-in ballots that Twitter Inc. flagged as inaccurate. Zuckerberg has said repeatedly that he doesn’t want to remove posts from elected officials, but would rather let users make up their minds about the content.

A number of civil rights groups, including the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League, are among those unhappy with Facebook’s history of allowing posts they say encourage voter suppression. Those groups have organized a Facebook advertising boycott for the month of July, and a number of well-known consumer brands are participating, including outdoor gear company Patagonia, Verizon Communications Inc. and Unilever.

Facebook will now prohibit ads that paint anyone from a certain race, ethnicity, gender identity or sexual orientation as dangerous. The company will expand those policies to better protect immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers from ads that say these groups of people are inferior.

The company will also label posts that it keeps up even though they violate policies, if they come from a newsworthy source, such as the president. “We’ll allow people to share this content to condemn it, just like we do with other problematic content, because this is an important part of how we discuss what’s acceptable in our society — but we’ll add a prompt to tell people that the content they’re sharing may violate our policies,” Zuckerberg said.

“Continuing to advertise on these platforms at this time would not add value to people and society,” the company said in a statement. Its Facebook ban also will cover Instagram.

The Facebook advertising boycott came after civil-rights groups including the Anti-Defamation League and NAACP called on brands to pull ad spending from Facebook for July. The groups said the social-media giant hadn’t made enough progress enforcing its policies on hate speech and misinformation.

Twitter was not a target of the civil-rights group’s boycott call, but it has also come under scrutiny on Madison Avenue.

Representatives from Facebook and Twitter were unavailable for immediate comment

Facebook has taken some steps in recent years to better police its platforms, adding workers and developing new technology. That has resulted in the removal of hate speech and other objectionable content.

“We acknowledge the efforts of our partners, but there is much more to be done, especially in the areas of divisiveness and hate speech during this polarized election period in the U.S.,” Unilever said in the statement. “The complexities of the current cultural landscape have placed a renewed responsibility on brands to learn, respond and act to drive a trusted and safe digital ecosystem.”

Mr. Di Como said Unilever would like to see a reduction in the level of hate speech on the platforms and wants independent companies to measure and confirm that progress has been made.

After all, Amazon already invested in an electric truck maker and is a major buyer of everything from planes to diesel vehicles.

But in a statement on Friday confirming its acquisition of the autonomous vehicle startup, Amazon touted Zoox for its ride-hailing ambitions. Ride hailing? Amazon?

“You say, does it make sense?” said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner vice president who tracks the auto industry. “Well, does it make sense that the package delivery company sells me streaming movies?”

Zoox is a corporate investment, not an acquisition to be folded into one of Amazon’s existing businesses, the company says. Aicha Evans, Zoox’s chief executive officer, and Jesse Levinson, co-founder and chief technology officer, will continue to lead the company as a standalone business.

“Zoox is working to imagine, invent, and design a world-class autonomous ride-hailing experience,” said Jeff Wilke, the head of Amazon’s worldwide retail business. “We’re excited to help the talented Zoox team to bring their vision to reality in the years ahead.”

Amazon’s corporate development team recently told bankers they wanted to look at any autonomous vehicle startup interested in selling, according to a person familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.

Amazon shares were little changed Friday morning in New York, while Uber Technologies Inc. fell less than three per cent — in line with the overall market.

Terms of the deal, the latest indication of Amazon’s evolution from online bookseller to sprawling conglomerate, were not announced on Friday. But the Information reported earlier that Amazon would pay more than $1 billion U.S.

Autonomous vehicles have been a target of automakers, Silicon Valley giants and venture capital investors for years. But technical and regulatory hurdles have made getting self-driving cars and trucks on the road a longer slog than boosters had hoped.

Founded in 2014, Zoox had outsize ambition and financial backing. It aimed to not only build hardware and software capable of piloting cars, but to design autonomous taxis themselves.

The Foster City, Calif.-based startup wanted to build a fully driverless vehicle by this year. However, after a 2018 funding round that valued Zoox at $3.2 billion, the board voted to oust Tim Kentley-Klay as CEO. He criticized the move, saying directors were “optimizing for a little money in hand at the expense of profound progress.”

The company last year indicated it was seeking investors and potential strategic partners, a situation made more urgent by the disruption of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to layoffs that Zoox characterized as temporary.

In its statement, Amazon highlighted Zoox’s “ground-up vehicle” that “focuses on the ride-hailing customer.”

Despite its challenges, Zoox was one among a few independent companies working on credible autonomous vehicle technology, said Ramsey, the Gartner analyst. “Amazon is all of a sudden real close to being its own automaker,” he said.

The company could integrate future ride-hailing services into its Prime membership program, Ramsey added. And despite Amazon’s assertion that it was interested in Zoox because of its ambitions in ride-hailing — already a fiercely a contested market — Ramsey said Amazon would probably consider using the autonomous technology in delivery vehicles.

Bulking up in driverless technology represents an expansion of Amazon’s already sprawling interests in transportation and logistics. The company, which used to rely on delivery partners like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. to move packages from its warehouses to customers, in the last several years has invested heavily in its own capacity to move goods, acquiring planes, vans and long-haul trailers.

Seattle-based Amazon has also invested in delivery drones — though it didn’t meet the goal CEO Jeff Bezos set of having them flying packages to customers by 2018 — as well as sidewalk-crawling robots and autonomous carts.

Last year, Amazon invested along with Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital in Aurora Innovation Inc., a self-driving startup led by the former heads of Google’s driverless car project and Tesla Inc.’s Autopilot team. The company has also backed Rivian Automotive Inc., the electric pickup and SUV maker, and emerged as its biggest buyer, pledging to acquire 100,000 delivery vans designed in partnership with Amazon.

The Toronto-based retail distributor has had to confront myriad supply chain issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, but she calls the current school and home life situation of Canadian families an “operational nightmare.”

“It’s the uncertainty that’s eating away at people,” says Pretty, adding that some of her retailer customers are relying on a skeleton staff of childless workers to keep physical locations running. “I can’t make plans about how to grow my businesses. . . . I can’t imagine what my revenue might be like.”

After months of balancing childcare and online schooling with work responsibilities, anything short of complete school reopening presents a crucial challenge for families. Without children in school five days a week, someone has to care for them, and working full-time while simultaneously caring for children is simply not possible — even when working remotely is an option.

Schools in most of Quebec have been open since May, while those in B.C, Manitoba and P.E.I. have partially reopened. The remaining provinces and territories plan on having students return to the classroom in the fall, though details have not been finalized. School boards are mulling scenarios such as alternating days or weeks with smaller class sizes or continued at-home learning.

The result is a significant number of workers who feel they have little choice but to leave the workforce until a semblance of stability is restored.

According to Statistics Canada’s June Labour Force Survey,the employment recovery has been “slowest for mothers with school-aged children,” with employment rising 5.2 per cent for women and 6.4 per cent for men with children younger than six. For mothers of children ages six to 17, however, women’s employment remains below pre-pandemic levels, and women with children are more likely to be working less than half their usual hours.

Pretty has kids of her own, but she says she can’t take leave as people depend on her for their wages. She’s considering enrolling her children in private school in Orillia, Ont. in the hopes they would have smaller class sizes and a safer environment. And she isn’t alone.

“I know lots of people considering taking a leave of absence,” says Pretty. “I know someone who sold a second business. I know teachers who are considering leaves of absence — they have little people at home.”

Susan Prentice, a sociology professor at the University of Manitoba who studies childcare policy, says the current situation will cause “unfathomably tough problems” for families to figure out.

“For any household that has children, a school closing is a make-or-break factor for family decision making,” says Prentice. “Women trying to do homeschooling by day and trying to do their own work at night — in the end, they manage it at the expense of their own health, by sleeping very little. You can get through a short-term period like this, but it’s not sustainable over months or semesters.”

Experts say there simply aren’t enough daycare spots to accommodate the number of school age children who may find themselves without a caregiver if parents return to work. Monica Lysack, a professor of early childhood leadership at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ont. says that even in the best of times, Canada only has space in licensed childcare facilities for less than 30 per cent of kids.

“Imagine being told your business could open up only at half capacity, and you have to keep going with all the same expenses,” says Lysack of childcare centres in the pandemic.

“That means parents are going to have to pay double fees, for already astronomically priced childcare ... And where are the other 50 per cent of children going to go?”

For many families, having two working parents is not optional. Prentice says that families have been able to offset flat wages in the Canadian economy through the contributions of working mothers.

“This discussion of dual earners, or 1.5 earners as we sometimes call part-time work, it’s really mothers,” says Prentice. “When children are in school, this is when mothers’ labour force participation rate jumps to its highest.”

“If [schools] open on some crazy extraordinary schedule, like two days one week, three days the next week, this will play havoc with the ability of mothers and fathers to keep their jobs. It will play havoc on children. And it immediately has huge, huge economic and social consequences,” says Prentice.

Pretty says that among the concerns she’s hearing from her employees and clients, the return to school is the most pressing.

An antitrust tussle that’s coming to a head in Australia is set to change that.

Australia’s competition regulator will this month publish draft rules forcing the two U.S. tech giants to share revenue generated from news with the original publishers, including Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. A final version of the code, the first of its kind in the world, is due to follow soon after.

Between them, Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have a dominant position in the online advertising market and that has been under intensifying regulatory and political assault in the U.S. and Europe, with Australia now adding another front of attack.

Investors are sitting up, too. Should watchdogs in other markets follow Australia, it would chip away at two of the most wildly successful business models of the 21st century, built largely on content free-for-alls. Facebook and Alphabet have combined market values in New York of about $1.7 trillion (U.S.)

“This would be a major shot across the bow from a regulatory perspective,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities in New York. “It could open up a Pandora’s box around monetization and sharing of data.”

‘This one matters’

In an interview, Australian Competition & Consumer Commission Chairman Rod Sims said he knows of several counterparts overseas who are considering taking similar steps. With traditional media hemorrhaging jobs and facing an assault from populist politicians alleging fake news, the 69-year-old is swinging the pendulum back in the publishers’ favour. To Sims, it’s about more than simply forcing businesses on his beat to play fair.

“This one matters because journalism matters,” he said. “The fourth estate is such a fundamental part of what makes our societies work.”

Traditional media companies have long complained their content is being exploited by digital platforms without due compensation. But that’s only part of the picture.

While platforms and publishers all compete for web clicks and eyeballs that can be turned into advertising revenue, they’re also allies of sorts. News stories, or even just links to them, are part of the appeal of Facebook and Google, helping them keep visitors engaged and vacuum up more data. The tech giants, in turn, direct traffic back to the publishers’ websites.

‘Fundamentally incorrect’

The nature of this relationship is central to the crackdown by Australia’s competition watchdog. “There’s no doubt the net value flow is to the platforms,” said Sims. Facebook has called such an assumption “fundamentally incorrect.”

In a 58-page submission to the ACCC last month, Facebook described news as “highly substitutable” content. Even a complete purge of stories in Australia, Facebook said, would make little difference. “News does not drive significant long-term commercial value for our business,” it said.

Australian news organizations, meanwhile, garnered 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook’s newsfeed between January and May 2020, Facebook said.

At Google, only a “very small” direct and indirect economic value comes from news in Google Search, Australia Managing Director Mel Silva said in a May blog post. Meanwhile, Google Search accounted for 3.44 billion visits to Australian news publishers for free in 2018, she wrote.

Amid the dispute, it’s not clear what the code will cost the tech giants in Australia. That’s partly because in between the baby pictures and community group posts on Facebook, it’s almost impossible to quantify the subjective appeal of news. “I would say #goodluckregulators,” Rich Greenfield, an analyst at New York-based research firm LightShed Partners, said in an email. “I have no idea how they will determine the value.”

Turning tide

Even Sims warns it will be “extremely hard,” but says “there are always ways to put numbers around things.” And in recent months, publishers appear to have gained ground in the argument.

In April, France’s antitrust regulator ordered Google to pay media companies to display snippets of articles. Then in June, Google said it would pay certain media outlets it will feature in a yet-to-be-released news service in Germany, Australia and Brazil. Terms weren’t disclosed.

Perhaps most significantly, Facebook late last year introduced a separate news section, paying the publishers whose stories were featured. Some 200 publishers were involved in the Facebook News service, some of them receiving between $1 million and $3 million a year to put articles in the section.

The ACCC’s mandatory code goes further: the watchdog’s concepts paper raised the possibility of collective media boycotts of Facebook and Google in the absence of “appropriate remuneration.”

In a statement, Google said it has “worked closely and constructively with news media businesses, the ACCC and the government as part of this process and will continue to do so.”

Facebook “will continue to work closely with news organizations, the ACCC and the Australian government to sustain a strong news ecosystem,” said Mia Garlick, the company’s director of policy for Australia and New Zealand. But she said: “A regulatory approach that lumps two tech companies together and benefits only the most powerful publishers does not do that.”

Sims says he’s skeptical of Facebook’s argument that news delivers little economic value, and expects his code to start balancing the equation.

“I’m not contemplating failure,” Sims said.

The incredible rally in the stock has left Wall Street analysts struggling to make sense of the sky-high valuation — which soared past that of Toyota Motor Corp. earlier this month and topped $320 billion (U.S.) on Monday. Tesla shares are up about fourfold just this year, despite a steep pandemic-related sell-off in February and March.

Although Tesla had kicked off this year with a strong run, its ascent has been turbocharged after reporting better-than-expected delivery numbers earlier this month, leading many to say the company may be poised to report a profit for the second quarter. Profitability is good news in itself, but in the case of Tesla, this would also mark the fourth consecutive quarter of profit, a milestone it needs to achieve to be considered for inclusion in the S&P 500.

At the current price, Tesla’s stock reflects an expectation of 2030 volume of 5 million units, which is more than ten times what the company appears on track to achieve this year, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said. “We’re not saying these are assumptions that are not possible, but they are a very big leap ahead from what the company has proven to date,” the analyst wrote in a note. Jonas has a sell-equivalent rating on Tesla, with a price target of $740.

Tesla jumped as much as 16 per cent to $1,794.99 on Monday, the biggest intraday gain since March 24.

Good news abounds

Tesla late Friday said its much-anticipated “Battery Day” event will be held on Sept. 22, at its Fremont, California, factory. According to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, the automaker could announce a number of “game changing” battery developments at the event.

“The technology innovations around Fremont remain the key ingredients in Tesla’s success on the battery front and we believe the company is getting closer to announcing the million-mile battery,” Ives wrote in a note to clients. Ives expects the new battery to potentially last for decades, as well as withstand all types of weather and terrain.

Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin, one of the more skeptical analysts on the Street, upgraded his rating on Tesla to the equivalent of a hold from sell, saying the company is well down the path of preparing to enter the Indian market, where the analyst sees China-like potential. “We expect tangible evidence by the end of 2020, with sales in India starting as soon as 2021,” Irwin said.",[],436,0.9734506142456488

It has now raised than $1.2 billion to date, the company said.

chief executive officer Daniel Dines said in a statement the company would use the proceeds to grow and meet consumer demand.

The company said it has over $400 million in annual recurring revenue, a metric that measures its predictable revenue from subscriptions and returning customers.

Investors are enthusiastic about UiPath because of its strong revenue growth, said Carl Eschenbach, a UiPath board member and partner at Sequoia Capital. Changes in the global business climate this year have been a boon for UiPath.

“We think the whole pandemic that we’re facing as a world has accelerated the use of automation as people look to automate more of their processes as they’ve done in the past,” Eschenbach said.

UiPath works with a range of businesses to create efficiencies by reducing mundane tasks. It helps banks with loan processing and hospitals with data entry. Sometimes this results in the elimination of low-skilled jobs.

The Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index, a weekly composite measure of financial health and economic expectations, was largely unchanged at 46.1 last week, from 46.2 a week earlier. That ends a 10-week streak of gains.

The data could stoke concerns Canada’s recovery is slowing after a strong initial bounce back amid reopenings across the country. Policy-makers and economists have warned that repairing the damage from the COVID-19 lockdowns will be a prolonged and uneven process, with consumer sentiment plateauing well below pre-pandemic levels and households remaining cautious for some time.

The latest Nanos reading is in line with other indicators that point to a full recovery from the pandemic being a long way off. Last week, Statistics Canada data showed the labour market partially recovered in June, but that 60 per cent of jobs lost during the pandemic are still yet to be recouped.

Every week, Nanos Research surveys 250 Canadians for their views on personal finances, job security and their outlook for the economy and real estate prices. Bloomberg publishes four-week rolling averages of the 1,000 responses.

Survey highlights

Canadians’ perceptions of their personal finances remain gloomy. Only 13 per cent of respondents report being better off financially over the past year, close to all-time lows. About 37 per cent say their finances have worsened. That’s well above pre-pandemic levels, but down from 42 per cent in April.

Canadians are suddenly getting more pessimistic about the recovery. About 57 per cent of Canadians believe the economy will worsen over the next six months. That’s up from 53 per cent two weeks ago, but still well below the 80 per cent in April.

About 16 per cent of Canadians say they feel insecure or somewhat insecure about their employment, up from 15 per cent a week earlier. While that’s down about 10 percentage points from April, the improving trend in recent week for this gauge seems to have come to an end.

Real estate is the one area where positive sentiment is accelerating. The share of Canadians who anticipate price increases has doubled since May, to 21 per cent, and there are fewer respondents worried about falling property values. Still, sentiment is well below pre-pandemic levels.",[],371,0.8432450357325587

The apologies came within hours of each other, and after weeks of controversy following the Liberal government’s decision to award the charity a contract to deliver a $900-million program for student volunteers.

“The mistake that we made was on me and I take responsibility for it,” Trudeau told reporters Monday morning.

“Not only has it created unnecessary controversy and issues, it also means that young people who are facing a difficult time right now getting summer jobs, contributing to their communities, are going to have to wait a little longer.”

Trudeau has faced criticism for not recusing himself from the WE Charity decision since it was revealed earlier this month that WE’s for-profit corporation paid his mother and brother a combined $282,000 in speaking fees between 2016 and 2020.

For the Liberal government — which is facing an ethics investigation, charges of cronyism from the Opposition, a committee probe and waves of public scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic — the family ties don’t end there.

Morneau also took part in the decision-making process around the WE contract, even though his daughter was working for the organization.

In the summer of 2019, Morneau also announced that the government had given a $3 million grant to WE.

Morneau wasn’t available for an interview on Monday. In an emailed statement to the Star, Morneau acknowledged that he should not have taken part in the decision-making process.

“I did not recuse myself from the discussions on this topic and, given the fact that my daughter works for the organization in an unrelated branch, I now realize I should have in order to avoid any perception of conflict,” he said.

“I apologize for not doing so, and moving forward, I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE.”

WE Charity was awarded the $19.5-million contract to administer the volunteer program in late June. The organization and the government said they came to a mutual decision to cancel the deal amid accusations of ethics violations.

Trudeau now faces his third ethics investigation as prime minister.

During his Monday news conference, Trudeau said he was “very aware” that members of his family worked with WE but added he was “unaware of the details of the remuneration.”

He added that he would “look at any invitations” that come in to testify before a parliamentary finance committee. Trudeau said other ministers and officials will be testifying this week.

“In this situation, I should have recused myself. Canadians will make their judgments about what we were trying to do and what I should have done.”

The government’s fiscal and economic “snapshot” last week boosted the budget of the wage subsidy program to $82.3 billion, in a sign of impending changes.

Trudeau isn’t saying today how the government will reshape the eligibility rules for the program that critics have said stop some employers from getting aid they need.

The wage-subsidy program covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits.

The Liberals originally saw the wage subsidy as a key tool in helping cushion the economic blow from COVID-19 by helping workers stay tied to their employers as businesses stayed closed due to the pandemic.

Instead, the budget for the program dropped as more workers accessed the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for people who lost their jobs or nearly all their hours.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

The budget for that program is now at $80 billion, but it’s scheduled to close in the fall.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau suggested last week that as health restrictions roll back and more companies reopen, more people would shift from the CERB to the wage subsidy. The government has pointed to about 1.2 million fewer people receiving the CERB in May in support of that view.

Morneau spent weeks leading up to July 8’s fiscal update getting input from businesses, labour groups and other stakeholders about how to reshape the program.

The government has hinted at changes to revenue-reduction thresholds that may discourage companies from growing, lest they find themselves suddenly cut off from federal aid.

“We need to reduce disincentives to growth,” Morneau said last week. “We need to make sure the subsidy is appropriate for the challenges facing enterprises in actually rehiring and getting people back to work.”

The Canadian Council of Business Leaders Against Anti-Black Systemic Racism and the Canadian Association of Urban Financial Professionals announced the plan dubbed the Black North Initiative on Monday.

The plan advocates for companies to work with them to hire more Black students for their internship/co-op programs and to ensure business succession planning strategies include a Black talent strategy to help build a pipeline of employees for future leadership positions.

It is also asking that businesses disaggregate their employee race data and publish it annually, including data on executive representation and/or employee mobility statistics for each racialized group.

The push to deal with systemic racism has gained strength in recent months in the wake of demonstrations held across Canada and the U.S.

A summit is planned for July 20 where business leaders will be asked to sign a CEO pledge and say what they are doing to fight anti-Black systemic racism.

The Canadian Association of Urban Financial Professionals has more than 600 Black professionals as members who work across Bay Street.

“The BlackNorth Initiative and CAUFP are fully aligned regarding the critical need to begin dismantling systemic racism in corporate Canada,” said Wes Hall, founder and chairman of the Canadian Council of Business Leaders Against Anti-Black Systemic Racism.

“Corporations must do more to create and nurture Black talent pipelines to ensure proper representation at the highest levels. This is a natural partnership in a shared mission that will lead to measurable results.”

The Calgary-based company says it has received written notice from Kellogg Brown & Root Ltd. that it is no longer prepared to enter into a lump-sum turnkey engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning contract for the project as agreed in March 2019, although it is willing to provide the services on other terms.

Pieridae CEO Alfred Sorensen says the company is considering options including legal action in response, but has already had discussions with other firms willing to replace KBR.

In May, Pieridae announced a delay in making a final decision on proceeding with the project to export liquefied natural gas from Canada’s East Coast, citing technical obstacles created by COVID-19.

Also in May, the Alberta Energy Regulator put Pieridae’s natural gas supply in question when it refused to transfer licences for production assets purchased from Shell Canada because the application would have split liabilities for cleaning up the sites, especially two gas-processing plants. (Shell and Pieridae are trying to work with the AER to win approval.)

Sorensen says the project is “solid”, however, with most of its key permits in hand, a 20-year contract with a German energy company to buy half of the LNG and a potential loan guarantee from the German government.

“There are other reputable and experienced firms who have the expertise to provide these services, with some already indicating a willingness to replace KBR,” said Sorensen in a news release. “We have had discussions with several of them to gauge their interest.”

Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc’s Google, said Monday that the project will focus on building products that are relevant to India’s needs and empowering businesses for their “digital transformation.”

“Our goal is to ensure India not only benefits from the next wave of innovation, but leads it,” Pichai said in a digital keynote at a Google for India event.

The company also announced it will invest $1 million to support digital education in India. It said the fund will enable 1 million teachers in 22,000 schools across the country to use Google services that can facilitate online learning.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made digitization a major priority for India.

He envisions a “Digital India,” where high-speed internet access will empower entrepreneurs to build software and other technology products to help raise the standard of living in a country where many households are still impoverished.

Modi styles himself as a leader in touch with technology. He has nearly 60 million Twitter followers.

Modi said in a tweet that he and Pichai met and discussed a wide range of subjects, “particularly leveraging the power of technology to transform the lives of India’s farmers, youngsters and entrepreneurs.”

“I was delighted to know more about the efforts of @Google in several sectors, be it in education, learning, @_DigitalIndia, furthering digital payments and more,” he said.

Yannis Mallat’s departure comes amid recent allegations of sexual harassment that have rocked the Paris-based company’s Montreal and Toronto studios.

Mallat’s exit was communicated to staff in a memo from CEO Yves Guillemot.

“The recent allegations that have come to light in Canada against multiple employees make it impossible for him to continue in this position,” Guillemot said in the memo.

Christophe Derennes, formerly executive vice-president of production at the Montreal studio, will now lead that studio, while Christine Burgess-Quémard, executive director, Ubisoft worldwide, will take over the other Canadian studios, including Toronto.

“This decision is difficult, but necessary given the magnitude of the problems raised in recent weeks at our studios in Montreal and Toronto,” Burgess-Quémard said in a staff memo regarding Mallat’s departure.

Last week, the company announced that Maxime Béland, its Toronto-based vice-president of editorial, resigned and another unidentified employee in Toronto was fired.

And in Paris, vice-president of editorial and creative services Tommy François was placed on disciplinary leave.

As well as Mallat, chief creative officer Serge Hascoët has resigned, as has Cécile Cornet, global head of human resources, “as she believes it is in the best interest of the Company’s unity,” according to a statement from Ubisoft.

In the staff memo, Guillemot said Hascoët’s resignation comes after “in-depth discussions we have had together.” Guillemot will be “personally” overseeing a “complete overhaul” of the way the editorial department works, according to the memo.

The multiple public announcements of the departures mark a shift for an industry that has long grappled with sexism and harassment but dealt with allegations behind closed doors, said Concordia University communications studies professor Mia Consalvo, who holds the Canada research chair in game studies and design.

“You’re just seeing more and more public accusations, and I think that public opinion has changed enough since #MeToo and some other high-profile cases that the game industry finally has to publicly react to these things,” she said.

“It’s sad that it’s taken this long, but it is starting to happen.

“I don’t think anything’s going to be fixed overnight, but I think we are starting to see a larger consciousness, a larger acknowledgment that this is unacceptable.”

Ubisoft has not disclosed the nature of the allegations leading to these departures, but allegations on social media point to issues with the company’s culture, including bullying, sexual harassment, a “highly sexualized culture” rife with drinking and partying, and an incident where a female employee was choked at a staff party.

As one anonymous accuser put it: “Women are pitted against each other and then your issues are minimized. Your work opinions are overlooked and I have experience(d) being laughed at when I went to my boss about issues and told not to tell him when I mentioned that during a monthly party, a colleague came to my desk as I was still working and told me he wanted me to give him a blow job.”

The Star has not been able to independently verify the allegations.

Montreal HR firm Relais Expert Conseil is heading an independent investigation open to current and former Ubisoft employees.

Mallat did not respond to a request for comment; neither did Béland last week.

Ubisoft previously announced that it is shaking up its HR processes in response to the allegations. In a July 2 letter to staff titled “Change Starts Today,” Guillemot announced a “structural shift” including the appointment of a head of workplace culture and a review of the company’s procedures.

“No one should ever feel harassed or disrespected at work, and the types of inappropriate behaviour we have recently learned about cannot and will not be tolerated,” wrote Guillemot.

Externally moderated sessions with employees were set to begin Monday.

The company manufacturers a variety of products used for packaging, including tapes and films.

The company had experienced a 10 per cent year-over-year decline in sales over the first part of the quarter to May 8 because of the COVID slowdown.

The notice on the door said he was being evicted for nonpayment of rent for more than 15 days.

There was — and still is — a freeze on residential evictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But tenants in Ontario who share a kitchen or bathroom with their landlord or the landlord’s family are exempt from the Residential Tenancies Act (RTA). Peter was being evicted under the Commercial Tenancies Act (CTA), before the commercial eviction freeze was enacted.

Peter said his basement unit had a kitchen, but that his landlord removed all the kitchen appliances shortly before evicting him to make it look as if they shared a kitchen. (His landlord disputes this and says the appliances were removed months before Peter arrived.)

Peter, who didn’t want his real name used because he is now living at a shelter and is concerned this story could affect his search for housing, hasn’t managed to get his belongings back — he said when he tried, he was arrested and ticketed for trespassing.

He’s in contact with a legal clinic, which he said is recommending he files a T2 to the Landlord and Tenant Board, which concerns harassment, illegal entry and illegal lockouts.

Shaun Harvey, a paralegal with Riverview Legal Services in Kitchener, has been trying to call the government’s attention to the issue of tenants being exempt from the RTA for years. The pandemic has made the problem more visible, he said.

Students and vulnerable, low-income people are those most often affected by the RTA exemption, said Harvey. He wants the government to amend the Residential Tenancies Act to include this type of tenant.

Harvey has sent his recommendations to the Attorney General, the provincial NDP, his local representatives and the Premier’s office.

“The idea is to close the gap,” he said.

The Residential Tenancies Act, created in 2006, does not apply to people who “are required to share a bathroom or kitchen facility with the owner, the owner’s spouse, child or parent or the spouse’s child or parent.”

It also does not address how such cases should be governed.

Harvey said there are three ways they are often dealt with:

One, the landlord simply changes the locks on the tenant. Two, the landlord calls police and has the tenant removed for trespassing. (Harvey said neither action is legal.) Three, the landlord applies to the Superior Court of Justice to obtain a writ of possession, which gives a sheriff legal power to enforce an eviction.

But a 2019 Ontario Superior Court decision seems to have paved the way for tenants in this situation to be evicted as commercial tenants, said Harvey.

In the case, Newman v. Glanville, a man first sought to evict his tenant with whom he shared a kitchen and bathroom under the Residential Tenancies Act. The judge ruled that the Commercial Tenancies Act would apply in this case, and used the CTA to rule in favour of the landlord.

The CTA states that it “does not apply to tenancies and tenancy agreements to which the Residential Tenancies Act applies,” implying that it could apply to all other tenancies.

Harvey argues that thanks to this case, tenants under this exemption are more likely to be evicted via the CTA, which sets out much harsher terms of eviction than the RTA. And trying to fight these evictions is much more costly, he said.

Joe Myers, executive director of Willowdale Community Legal Services, said in an email that the clinic receives “many” calls from tenants who are exempt from the RTA due to sharing a bathroom or kitchen with their landlord.

“This is a common situation in Toronto where rents are high and there is little affordable housing. Tenants living in these types of sharing arrangements are vulnerable as their landlords can evict them without having to resort to the legal process outlined in the RTA — serving a notice of termination, filing an application at the Landlord and Tenant Board, convincing the Board to issue an order terminating the tenancy at the conclusion of a hearing,” said Myers.

“These types of tenancies and evictions were common prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and remain so.”

Harvey’s suggestion is to bring tenants like Peter into the RTA, with a couple of conditions, such as no automatic lease renewal.

He wants to see the same change apply to students who are residents of school institutions, who face the same issue right now: “(The) school can turf them without any real process.”

Benjamin Ries, staff lawyer for housing at the University of Toronto’s legal clinic, said it’s a “major problem” that tenants sharing a bathroom or kitchen with their landlord have much less security than those with their own apartments.

He said the tenants exempt from the RTA are in a wide range of situations, some of which closely resemble a “normal” tenancy, and yet aren’t regulated.

Ries believes it’s more common today for people to be living in this kind of situation than it was when the rules around residential tenancies were first drawn up in Ontario in the 1970s, in part thanks to platforms such as Facebook, which make it easy for people to find roommates, as well as a rise in housing inaffordability.

“Our whole idea of what housing looks like has evolved,” he said, adding it’s time that we take that into consideration.

RELATED STORIES GTA Why this renter is suddenly homeless despite Ontario’s order to halt evictions

At minimum, Ries said many of these currently exempt tenants should have more protections when it comes to being told they have to move out.

That so many people are now sharing apartments with nonfamily members illustrates the lack of affordable housing, said Ries.

“Plainly what we pay people on (Ontario Works) and (Ontario Disability Support Program) is not enough anymore, in a city like Toronto anyway, to afford your very own self-contained apartment,” he said.

Kenn Hale, director of advocacy and legal services for the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario (ACTO), said while there isn’t evidence of an “overwhelming tide” of illegal evictions during the pandemic, most tenants evicted during the pandemic have been either exempt or in a grey area when it comes to the RTA.

These tenants are more likely to be low income and vulnerable in other ways, since they can’t afford to rent a full apartment, he said. And because they aren’t covered under the RTA, neither they nor their landlords have access to the type of dispute resolution available to “regular” tenants and landlords.

“The answer really is to have accessible dispute resolution processes and have a landlord tenant board that can respond to the variety of situations that people find themselves (in), rather than leaving these people completely outside of any kind of legal protection.”

These tenants are also exempt under the human rights code, said Hale, which usually prevents people from being denied tenancy due to factors including race or disability, something ACTO has been advocating to change.

Hale agreed with Ries that the issue is illustrative of the overall lack of affordable housing, and thinks these tenants could be brought into the RTA “with some special rules” to account for their situations.",[],1206,0.9813806797153797

Bartlett and her husband have been going to St. Lucia for a dozen years now, living in a neighbourhood where they are the “token Canadians,” welcomed warmly by their neighbours. Bartlett, an artist, is a volunteer teacher at the local school and gets involved with numerous local projects.

“I really enjoy it,” said Bartlett. “Some of my best friends are there now. I can’t think of not going but, this winter, we may be stuck here.”

Bartlett and her husband aren’t the only Canadians whose travel plans have been thrown into disarray by COVID-19. Many Canadian snowbirds — retirees who spend their winters in warmer climates — are concerned about travelling south, especially to the United States.

A May 17 Ipsos poll indicated that only 20 per cent of Canadians anticipate travelling outside Canada in 2020; 50 per cent would not be at all likely to do so.

Undoubtedly, they are influenced by Global Affairs Canada’s ongoing COVID-19 travel advisory, recommending that Canadians “avoid all non-essential travel outside Canada and to avoid all cruise ship travel until further notice.” The ban has meant that Canadian insurers are not issuing travel health insurance for people who ignore the advisory, putting snowbirds at risk for health expenses related to COVID-19 and other ailments.

“We contacted an insurance broker and he said no, that as long as the travel advisory is in effect, non-essential travel won’t be covered by insurance,” said Bartlett. “It would be irresponsible to go to St. Lucia without insurance. It would be like driving a car without auto insurance.”

TD Insurance says on its website that people who contract the coronavirus won’t be covered for any claim “while this non-essential travel advisory remains in place.” Manulife Insurance advises customers that any policy issued after March 5, 2020 will not cover COVID-19. For policies that extend into the future, “your coverage remains in place for its full duration as per the policy terms and conditions” — which means it’s unlikely that COVID-19 will be covered.

Snowbirds generally rely on individual travel insurance plans. For group insurance plans, members must contact their providers about what is covered and what will be covered in the future, if that has been decided.

At present, most Canadian insurers are no longer selling individual travel insurance because most policies have a clause that points directly to the government and the threat level in place. In fact, said Joan Weir, director of health and disability policy for the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, even once travel restrictions are loosened and Canadian insurers are offering travel policies again, “it’s likely that COVID-19 coverage won’t be included in the benefits.”

The association, which represents 99 per cent of Canadian travel insurers, works closely with Global Affairs Canada. Weir said her sense is that “the government will take a very conservative and orderly approach to lowering the threat level for travel. Travel will probably not be allowed to every country at once; the government will evaluate each country separately.”

Jana Ray, chief membership and benefits officer for CARP, the advocacy organization for older Canadians, says it’s not surprising that Canadian insurers are hesitant to sell travel insurance.

“Cases are so high in parts of the United States right now that I can’t imagine insurers are ready to offer coverage at this time,” she said. “Currently insurers are taking it day by day and anticipating a second wave, so things are up in the air.”

Snowbirds can take heart, however: there are U.S. insurers offering visitors coverage that includes COVID-19.

“For some companies, the claims risk is considered lower than the premiums they would lose if they didn’t offer COVID-19 coverage,” said Narendra Khatri, chief executive officer of Texas-based Insubuy, a brokerage that offers policies to travellers outside their home countries.

Insubuy currently offers COVID-inclusive policies underwritten by Crum & Forster to Canadians travelling to the United States, the Caribbean or other countries; the policies are available for people up to age 89.

They cover travellers for up to $100,000 in medical expenses. A six-month policy for a 70-year-old would cost $250 (U.S.); age determines the cost of coverage, rather than pre-existing conditions, Khatri noted.

As of July 15, Lloyd’s of London will also offer travel insurance that includes COVID-19 coverage.

As fall approaches, Khatri expects business to boom, especially if Canadian insurers still aren’t offering coverage.

“Just last week, we had several Canadian brokers sign up with us,” he said. “People understand the importance of travel insurance, especially because there is no universal health care here.”

However, Ray urges snowbirds to think twice before they jump at U.S. coverage.

“If you have co-morbidities, such as heart issues, you should consider your travel options very carefully,” Ray said. “We don’t want people to be underinsured. When you talk about respirators and heart conditions, you could go through $50,000 in coverage in a week, no problem.”

Nonetheless, the availability of coverage offers a glimmer of hope to snowbirds like Bartlett.

“It’s not just the money we bring to foreign economies,” said Bartlett. “Many snowbirds do a lot of great things in our adopted communities. All of those things will be lost if we can’t travel this winter.”

Before you travel this winter:

Visit the Government of Canada’s travel website at https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories for travel advice and advisories.

Check with your insurer to see if your travel insurance includes treatment related to COVID-19 outside Canada.

Consider “cancel for any reason” trip cancellation coverage that is more flexible but may be more expensive.

Remember that there are new health requirements to meet when boarding your flight. Trip cancellation insurance is not intended to pay expenses if denied boarding.

Understand that trip cancellation insurance requires that any compensation provided by the travel supplier, including vouchers for credit, is generally deducted from the amount eligible for reimbursement.

Know the entry requirements for the country to which you are travelling and follow their directions (e.g. 14-day quarantine, COVID-19 test at destination or before boarding the plane).

Be aware that if you need to return to Canada for medical care your options may be limited due to decreased availability of flights.

Make sure that you have travel insurance coverage for your entire trip as some insurers may limit options to extend policies after departure.

Be prepared to return to Canada quickly should the government of Canada raise the travel advisory level again. Your travel insurance benefits may be limited.

Understand that when you return to Canada, you will be subject to federal and provincial or territorial government requirements regarding quarantine, testing and exposure tracking.

The Trump administration is “just getting started” with the two apps, and he wouldn’t rule out the U.S. banning them, Navarro said on Fox News on Sunday. Even if TikTok is sold to an American buyer, it wouldn’t solve the problem, he said.

“If TikTok separates as an American company, that doesn’t help us,” Navarro said. “Because it’s going to be worse — we’re going to have to give China billions of dollars for the privilege of having TikTok operate on U.S. soil.”

President Donald Trump said last week his administration is considering banning the short video app TikTok in the U.S. The examination of TikTok was part of a broader effort to protect American citizens’ private data, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo had said. Navarro didn’t specify which action the administration might take.

TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance Ltd., is popular among teens in the U.S. WeChat, owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings, is the top communication app in mainland China and used by Chinese users globally.

TikTok has drawn concern among U.S. officials and corporate America is looking into its use among staff. Wells Fargo & Co. asked employees to remove TikTok from their work phones due to concerns about the security.

Amazon.com Inc. told employees on Friday to delete TikTok from mobile devices they use to access company email, but later said the instruction was an error.

Navarro alleged that Amazon’s decision to “back away” shows the “power of the Chinese Communist Party on corporate America.”

‘American puppet’

TikTok has repeatedly denied allegations that it poses a threat to U.S. national security. The company is mulling changes to its corporate structure to distance itself from China. TikTok is considering a number of locations for a global base, the person familiar with the plans told Bloomberg earlier. Its five largest offices are in Los Angeles, New York, London, Dublin and Singapore.

Navarro said TikTok is running the same playbook as Huawei Technologies Co. by hiring former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as new CEO. Putting “an American puppet” in charge is not going to work, he said.

No brand in Canada has more than 41 per cent recognition among current cannabis users, with most languishing between one per cent and 15 per cent, according to a survey of 3,000 consumers conducted by pot data firm Brightfield Group.

Even those that attract the most attention aren’t converting that awareness into purchases. While Canopy Growth Corp.’s Tweed and Aurora Cannabis Inc.’s Drift have the widest brand awareness at 41 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, less than half of consumers familiar with those brands actually go out and buy them, according to Brightfield’s report.

“Industry players have primarily focused on raising capital, but this has not inherently translated into strong customer relationships,” the report says. “As the market becomes more consumer-centric, brands must focus on developing a deep understanding of the competitive landscape and consumer behaviour to stay relevant and ensure they don’t risk being seen as a commodity.”

Unlike more mature consumer markets, the brands that attract the highest levels of satisfaction aren’t necessarily those with the most awareness either.

Tilray Inc.’s Canaca, for example, has very low consumer awareness at nine per cent but those who buy it tend to love it, with 97 per cent reporting overall satisfaction and 99 per cent saying they’re likely to purchase again. Tweed, by comparison, has an 89 per cent overall satisfaction score and 90 per cent are likely to buy it again.

What does this mean for Canadian cannabis companies, according to Brightfield? “For now, it’s anyone’s game.”

CBD labeling

A U.S. Food and Drug Administration study of CBD products shows the category is still very much the Wild West.

Of the 102 products studied that indicated a specific amount of CBD, less than half came within 20 per cent of the amount promised. Meanwhile, 37 per cent had more than 120 per cent of the amount indicated and 18 per cent contained less than 80 per cent of the advertised amount, according to the FDA.

Perhaps most troubling for those consumers who choose CBD because they’re not comfortable with its psychoactive cousin THC, 49 per cent of the products tested contained some measurable amount of THC or the closely related compound THCA.",[],368,0.8855032094401177

Investors on the hunt for havens have found value in gold and the shares of companies that mine it, as a wall of worry rises about a new wave of COVID-19 infections.

In a pandemic-struck world, awash in stimulus from central banks and governments, the attraction of a hard asset that carries no counterparty risk is difficult for many to ignore. This week the price of gold surged over the key level of $1,800 (U.S.) an ounce, putting it on track for a fifth straight week of gains.

That has helped the S&P/TSX Materials Index, home to more than 30 Canada-based precious metals miners, to surge 5.2 per cent so far this week, making it the best-performing sector this week. With an 18.8 per cent gain for the year, it’s No. 2 after tech.

Gold miners have been on fire since March, with equities outperforming the metal itself — so much so that materials, at 15 per cent of the S&P/TSX Composite Index, has surpassed energy. It now has the second-biggest weighting in the benchmark — a first since 2004, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Investor exuberance in gold has seeped into all corners of the market, driving up the value of popular exchange-traded funds such as the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (up 32.5 per cent this year) and Canada’s iShares S&P/TSX Global Gold Index ETF (up 39 per cent).

Some analysts say there’s more room for gold miners to rally.

Small-cap gold miners have increasingly seen interest as investors hunt for stocks with cheap valuations to pile into the action, said Canaccord Genuity analysts led by Carey MacRury.

Precious metals miners with less than $10 billion (Canadian) in stock market value have more than doubled on average since March 13, with the best performance seen in stocks with less than $1.5 billion, according to data compiled by Canaccord. “Even after this outperformance, the smaller names trade at significant discounts to the large caps,” the analysts said.

Haywood Securities Inc.’s mining team believes that interest from investors will continue to “broaden” and recommends putting their money in companies that have leverage to the price of gold itself.

Where to from here? A mix of slow growth, easy money and black swans can propel gold to record highs in the second half of this year. (Gold topped out at about $1,900 (U.S.) an ounce in 2011.) Lingering fears about lockdowns, huge numbers of virus cases in the U.S. and a stalled economic recovery could keep demand strong for havens.

A V-shaped economic rebound, on the other hand, may result in aggressive reductions in central bank stimulus. But for now, policy-makers are likely to remain dovish, and thus indirectly supportive of gold.",[],449,0.949786844179611

In an interview aired late Saturday by the pan-Arab Al-Arabiya TV, Ghosn refused to comment on allegations from prosecutors in the U.S., who said last week that he wired more than $860,000 (U.S.) to a company linked to one of the men accused of helping smuggle him out of Japan in a box in December.

Michael Taylor, a 59-year-old former Green Beret and private security specialist, and Peter Taylor, 27, are wanted by Japan on charges they helped Ghosn escape the country in December after he was released on bail.

Ghosn was arrested in November 2018 and was expected to face trial in April 2020. He posted 1.5 billion yen ($19 million Canadian) bail on two separate instances after he was arrested a second time on additional charges, and released again.

When pressed to speak about the Taylors, who are under arrest in the U.S., as well as others who helped him flee, Ghosn refused to speak about any specific person. He said that after he arrived in Lebanon he vowed not to speak about how he left Japan “because any statement I am going to make will endanger the people who helped me leave Japan.”

Asked if he is aiding those who helped him get out of Japan, Ghosn said, “of course.” When asked about the Taylors, Ghosn said: “You are talking about specific people, and I will not comment. However, I am helping everyone who stood by me as much as I can, financially and in any way I can.”

“I made the entire plan of how to get out, but I needed information and assistance. I am not ready to involve these people at this moment simply by talking about it,” he said. He is believed to have been smuggled inside a large box.

Ghosn, who holds Lebanese, Brazilian and French citizenship, said the “only side that stood by me is the Lebanese state. They intervened and they asked the Japanese state, ‘Why are you doing this to him?’”

Ghosn said that when he arrived in Lebanon, Japan requested the Lebanese government hand him over. “Lebanon approved, if they receive the case file. They (Japanese) didn’t send anything for six months,” he said.

Earlier this month, a Turkish court released four pilots and a private airline official from jail, pending the outcome of their trial on charges of smuggling Ghosn out of Japan to Lebanon, via Turkey.",[],427,0.9790081128983644

Statistics Canada report

Statistics Canada is scheduled to release its analysis of the effects of changing consumption patterns on consumer price indexes on Monday. The agency recently reported that the annual pace of inflation pulled back even further in May due to a drop in gasoline prices compared with a year ago as businesses shut due to the COVID-19 pandemic began to reopen slowly.

Pandemic effects on business

Statistics Canada will release its survey on the impact of COVID-19 on businesses in Canada on Tuesday. The Bank of Canada’s latest review of business and consumer expectations revealed how widespread uncertainty is muting rehiring and purchasing plans, with only half of firms polled expecting a rebound in their sales within the next year as COVID-19’s effects recede.

Home sales

The Canadian Real Estate Association is expected to release its figures for June home sales figures on Wednesday. Sales are expected to show a sharp increase compared with May as buyers returned to the market.

May manufacturing

Statistics Canada is scheduled to release its monthly survey of manufacturing for May on Wednesday. The agency previously reported that sales fell by a record amount in April, the first full month of physical distancing measures in the wake of COVID-19, but that sales were expected to regain at least some ground in May as factories moved to resume production.

Rate announcement

The Bank of Canada will release its latest interest rate announcement and monetary policy report on Wednesday. The central bank is expected to keep its key interest rate on hold at 0.25 per cent, while the monetary policy report will include an update to its economic forecast.

The new bid from Jordan Bitove and Paul Rivett, the entrepreneurs behind NordStar, has the support of Torstar’s board of directors, the voting trust of five families who control the Star’s A-class shares, as well as Fairfax Financial, the biggest holder of B-class shares, with roughly 40 per cent.

Under the terms of the revised bid, those agreements are “hard lock-ups,” meaning the voting trust and Fairfax can’t change their votes to support any other bid, a source said. That means the bidding war is effectively over.

“I’m beyond excited, humbled and really looking forward to the Star being around for the next 100 years,” said Bitove, who has vowed to keep the Star’s progressive Atkinson Principles intact.

The improved NordStar bid had the unanimous support of the Torstar board — meaning board member Martin Thall, who had held out for a higher offer after NordStar’s previously-announced $52 million, has decided to support the new bid.

The new offer tops a rival proposal from the Canadian Modern Media Holdings group, which includes Matthew Proud, CEO of Dye & Durham Corp., his brother Tyler Proud, CEO of technology company Avesdo Inc., finance industry veteran Neil Selfe and former Ontario finance minister and Ontario Liberal Party president Greg Sorbara.

Any response to the Proud-Selfe proposal was expected to come after it was made official. The deadline for that to happen had been Monday at 5 p.m.

A disappointed Selfe said he and the Prouds had been prepared to offer more.

“Our financing was firm, we would have been able to meet their timelines, and we were prepared to offer much more money,” said Selfe.

The Proud-Selfe offer also included so-called “contingent value rights” on top of the $58 million.

While the Proud-Selfe team didn’t publicly reveal where they were planning to get financing for their bid, sources say it was Canadian Western Bank.

A July 21 meeting where shareholders are being asked to vote on NordStar’s offer is scheduled to go ahead.

The deal is contingent on getting a majority of votes from A-class shareholders and B-class shareholders, as well as 66 per cent of the votes from both classes added together. The lock-up agreements mean the first two conditions are guaranteed to be met.

The deal is expected to officially close July 28 and Bitove and Rivett have said they intend to take Torstar private.

Bitove said that when they take ownership, he and Rivett will stand by their earlier commitment to support the progressive journalism the Star is known for. The two previously announced that they will bring former Ontario Liberal Premier David Peterson on board and intend to make him vice-chair once the takeover is complete.

“We are committed to the Atkinson Principles, the Toronto Star and excellent journalism,” Bitove said.

The latest bid still values the company at less than the $69 million in cash Torstar had on hand at the end of the first quarter. Torstar was also debt free.

Bitove and Rivett initially offered 56.6 cents per share, but that offer was rejected by Torstar’s board. Their 63-cent offer was made public in late May after being recommended by the board.

This biblical aphorism came to mind when my editors suggested that during these challenging times, I should concentrate on more affordable “cars for the masses.”

Ah, but who doesn’t enjoy a bit of candy now and then?

As Robert Browning said (aren’t we literary today?): “A man’s reach should exceed his grasp, or what’s a heaven for?”

Hence, the Lamborghini Huracán EVO. Starts at $305,691 for the coupé, $336,258 for the Spyder.

With a boatload of options — the “Grigio Artis” (i.e., grey) paint alone was $22,400 — my tester came to $384,991.

EVO is distinguished from other Huracáns by improved active aerodynamics and more carbon fibre, in the largely aluminum tub, and throughout the interior. This and other “lightweighting” techniques carve off 40 kilograms.

It’s very fast.

It’s very loud.

Both thanks to the mid-mounted naturally-aspirated 5.2-litre V-10, with 640 horsepower at 8,000 r.p.m., and 443 lb.-ft. of torque at 6,500 r.p.m.

Climbing in requires a bit of agility, and it may take a while to find a comfy seating position.

The seats are a nice balance of grip and comfort. My right thigh got a bit stiff after a few hours; might have something to do with being pressed to the firewall...

New for Huracán is a central touchscreen. Their website claims “traditional buttons become dematerialized,” as if that’s something to be proud of. When you are rocketing off into hyperspace, the last thing you want is to be fiddling with a touchscreen trying to turn off the radio.

Then again, the car is so loud it’s difficult to hear the radio or your phone anyway. Better to focus on your driving.

This screen also picks up fingerprints more readily than most, and you can’t set it to “daytime” brightness when the headlights are on.

Which of course they always should be.

So, let’s drive.

Hint — best spend a bit of time in this car before trying anything too dramatic. The technology makes the car so forgiving that you can get in way over your head right quickly.

Because the laws of physics always apply.

Flip the aircraft-style switch cover, press the button, and the beast roars to life.

Pull back the gear-selector release, tap a steering wheel paddle shifter for the seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox — there is no shift lever as such — and off we go.

The Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Integrata (for the linguistically-challenged, that’s Integrated Vehicle Dynamics) system somehow anticipates the driver’s intentions and adjusts the front-to-rear four-wheel drive torque split, four-wheel steering, torque vectoring, and traction control systems to get you around corners faster than you’d think possible.

That said, I did get a bit of front-end plowing on a local roundabout at a fairly modest speed, probably because during my late-spring test drive, the car was still sporting winter tires, having just been shipped in from Alberta.

You can select from three drive modes — Strada (street), Sport (duh...), Corsa (race) — by a switch in the six-o’clock steering wheel spoke. This is altogether too handy; you can inadvertently hit it if you’re busy at the wheel.

These settings change all those performance parameters to suit, and there’s a more noticeable delta in these settings than usual in such systems.

The dashboard display also changes to supply information relevant to that mode.

Corsa is a bit frenetic for anything but the track. (My helmet is packed and ready to go at a moment’s notice, Lamborghini...).

What’s missing is a “custom” setting; personally, I’d choose Sport for everything, but back off the transmission downshift sensitivity a notch.

The ALA (Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva, active Lamborghini aerodynamics) system opens and closes flaps at the front and rear to increase or decrease downforce as needed.

It can even open one side and close the other, to optimize the car’s handling in more-or-less real time.

One of the first controls you want/need to access in any Lamborghini is the front-end lift system. When exiting a garage or entering a gas station, pressing this switch lifts the front end by 40 mm to reduce the chances of scraping any of those expensive under-car bits.

Any Lamborghini guarantees a thrill-packed ride.

But the Huracán EVO might be my favourite from the stable of the fighting bull (Lamborghini’s traditional symbol).

While not as ultimately powerful as an Aventador, Huracán’s lighter weight makes it seem more agile, more accessible.

I’d probably opt for the Spyder. Hey — it’s a nice day as I type, and since I’m already dreaming...

Bring on more, particularly around schools. Anybody speeding near a school should lose their licence, that’s how strongly I feel.

(Of course, typically Toronto, it’s all about the money. Never mind slowing down traffic so children don’t get hit by cars and killed. The city is more interested in what it can get out of wallets. But I digress.)

Parents tell their kids, as I told mine, look both ways before crossing the street. You never know. But kids are kids. Sometimes they get excited and forget (which is why we have crossing guards now).

So my daughter’s about seven, and home for lunch with me, and I kiss her as she leaves to go back to school and she runs across the lawn and right in front of a car on the road. Thank God the driver had seen her coming and was ready to stop, which he did. She burst into tears when she realized what had happened.

We tell our kids, when you are standing at a stop sign or a light, make eye contact with the driver so he sees you and then you can cross. I come driving along and I have to stop at a sign and a neighbour’s little girl is standing, kitty-corner, across the road in the subdivision where we live. She waits for me to come to a stop and she looks at me and then she steps off the curb and right into the path of a car coming along the through street.

She was so busy making eye contact with me that she forgot to look both ways. She might have been 10. There’s so much to remember when you’re just starting life. Again, the driver of the other car sensed potential disaster and had slowed down enough to stop. But it was close.

There is a school in my GTA neighbourhood. It fronts on a suburban street and backs onto a busy commuter road. There are flashing yellow lights on the busy road with a 40 km/h limit, 20 fewer than normal which most people ignore anyway. The police aren’t there with radar often and when they are, they stick out like a sore thumb. When they aren’t, it’s the Indianapolis 500. Some people slow down, but not many. We need a camera.

Childhood is a dangerous time. I’m sure we can all think of close calls we had when we were little. I can think of a couple of instances when one false move would have meant you wouldn’t be reading this. My palms can actually start to sweat when I think of one in particular.

But most of us get through it, somehow. Others aren’t so lucky.

In 1962, I was a cub reporter on my first newspaper. I’m not going to name the town, except to say it’s in Ontario. I’m doing this because this story is upsetting and there might be people around who would remember it.

A 17-year-old kid parked his car, a 1957 Chevrolet with an automatic transmission, across the street from the high school, which was at the top of a steep hill. He didn’t put on his emergency brake and he didn’t turn his wheels toward the curb, which is stuff you learn in driving school, although in those days his driving school was probably his dad.

When the driver’s side door didn’t close the first time, he hauled off and slammed it shut and that caused the stem-mounted gear lever to pop out of park and snap over to drive. The car started to roll down the hill with the kid, who was walking across the street to the high school when it started to move, running to catch it and yelling for anyone around to watch out.

A 12-year-old girl was walking along a cross street at the bottom of the hill. It is a beautiful sunny morning and it is Friday and the weekend is coming and she doesn’t have a care in the world. And she freezes when she sees this car coming and a guy running behind it, yelling.

In her panic, she then starts running and runs into the path of the car and she dies when it crushes her against the porch of a house on the corner. It is an absolutely awful scene.

One thing stood out: you’ve heard of superhuman strength? It exists. In a life-and-death emergency, with their adrenalin pumping like crazy, two 10-year-old little boys who were walking behind the girl pushed that huge car off her in an attempt to help her.

As you can imagine, the 17-year-old boy whose carelessness started all this was beside himself.

How do I know? I arrived on the scene about 10 minutes after it happened. It was the police photographer’s day off and I was a two-way newspaperman — a reporter who took photographs — so they asked me to take the pictures for the anticipated inquest: the girl under a blanket in front of the house, the gearshift in drive, and so on. In return for the favour, they told me everything.

I was very upset, as was everybody. To this day, I equate schools with children and disaster and I have no patience for drivers of cars who ignore signs telling them to slow down because there are children around.

And a monetary fine mailed to their house is not good enough. Not even close. If it was up to me, and the sign said 40 km/h and they were caught going 45 or faster, they wouldn’t get a letter. A police officer would go to their house and arrest them.",[],969,0.8778050786860123

Hall wrote that McKellar and “other city planning experts” say we need a “more accommodating city, attuned to pedestrians and cyclists, and less dependent on hurtling trains and beeping traffic.”

Nice turn of phrase.

I would like to invite Messrs Hall, McKellar, and any “other city planning experts” to join me exactly six months from the date that story appeared — that would be Jan. 29, 2021 — on Yonge Street at York Mills Road, so I can watch them ride their bicycles north to Sheppard Avenue.

Where do those people live? And where do they work? How can they commute by bicycle?

Maybe they’re lucky, like I used to be.

Back in the day, I was a professor at Ryerson. We lived in Leaside. When I taught summer school classes, I sometimes rode my Raleigh to work, cutting through Rosedale on Glen Road, which bypassed many of the area’s hills.

But like many people with young families, we couldn’t afford a house big enough for our growing brood in Leaside. So we moved to the boonies, north of Milton.

Fortunately, I was an “early-adopter” of the “work where you live” mantra. My job means I can write in my home, and electronically send my stories to the Star.

Yep. I pretty much invented the concept of “telecommuter.”

Most of us aren’t so lucky.

Most of us live “here,” and work “there.”

So it’s either transit, commuter train, or the private automobile.

The 401 is the city’s “main street” any way you look at it. It carries hundreds of thousands of vehicles every single work day.

At times it’s the busiest highway in all of North America.

Riding a bicycle is illegal on the 401.

And riding a bicycle to work is simply not an option for the vast majority of Torontonians.

In July, never mind January.

I have heard city planners praise Copenhagen, Denmark, for its bike-friendly infrastructure.

The photos here show what the dash looks like — well-designed, with clear gauges and a ton of choices for information displays.

As usual with modern cars, you’ll be months into ownership and still be discovering stuff.

My tester had all the nanny systems, but they’re easy to shut off if you don’t want them. I don’t.

Same for the head-up display.

Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and a Wi-Fi hot spot for up to seven devices highlight the high-techery.

Amazon’s Alexa is available if you’ve got a weekend to spend learning how to use it.

It isn’t quite “natural speech,” but it’s getting there.

Most minor controls are by the dreaded push buttons. At least radio volume and the HVAC system have proper round knobs so you can work them without taking your eyes off the road.

You’ll have lots of places to store stuff, with cup holders and cubby bins galore.

Allergy sufferers will rejoice over the air ionizer system which helps remove pollen and dust from the car.

The front seats are really short in cushion length, so if you like lots of thigh support, this might not be your car. I found it acceptable (I’m five-foot-10), but I didn’t take any long trips.

The main dimensional difference between Encore and Encore GX is wheelbase. This translates into decent rear seat legroom for two (three is a bit of a squeeze).

The rear seat-back split-folds one-third/two-thirds, and the front passenger seat can fold flat for added luggage-carrying flexibility.

The two-level trunk also has decent capacity.

A button on the driver’s door lets you open the power liftgate all the way, halfway (for those low apartment garage ceilings) or to shut it off altogether. Not sure why you’d want that.

The 1.3-litre turbocharged three-cylinder engine produces a modest 155 horsepower at 5,600 r.p.m., but a healthy 174 lb.-ft. of torque, which peaks at a low 1,600 r.p.m. and stays pretty much at that level until 4,000.

It scores 9.0 l/100 km city, 8.0 l/100 km highway.

The lowest number I recorded was 8.1; interesting that this was a bit worse than the bigger Jeep Cherokee I tested immediately beforehand.

As they say, “your mileage may differ.”

Sometimes you get into a car, and it just feels right. Both Lady Leadfoot and myself felt this way about the Encore GX.

The engine feels surprisingly peppy with no marked turbo lag. That low peak torque peak r.p.m. number helps here.

It is also surprisingly quiet, not as raspy as most three-bangers.

It cruises at common (if not technically legal) highway speeds with ease.

The nine-speed autobox has a ratio for every purpose; drive gently and you might never see three grand...

You can switch to manual shift mode, but in a car like this, I’m not sure why you’d want to.

The ride is on the firm side by historical Buick standards, but I’ll take that every time.

The steering is light and precise, and the car’s small size makes it feel nimble.

The “AWD” button on the console locks the car into four-wheel drive mode; otherwise, it’s an on-demand deal.

Good weather during my test didn’t give me much chance to test this, but quick acceleration runs on a gravel road with and without the system engaged showed it can make a difference.

So, how does one choose from what must be a dozen smallish crossovers currently available?

They’ve all been market-researched to death, so all offer roughly the same features at similar prices.

Let me make that decision a bit tougher by recalling an old Buick ad slogan: “Wouldn’t you really rather have a Buick?”

In the case of the Encore GX, you just might.",[],798,0.8052416979303645

I didn’t recognize it, or the driver. He seemed to be in a hurry and was right on my tail.

The main road passes a school. Although school’s been out for three months, there are still yellow flashing lights and a sign saying the speed limit had dropped from 50 km/h to 40 and, as I always (usually) follow the rules, I didn’t go faster than 40. Although there was room to pass, the guy behind me didn’t but hung right on my back bumper.

We passed through several traffic lights and finally pulled onto a ramp leading to Highway 403. Every step of the way, he was right there. And I mean right there. One false move and he’d have hit me. Even my wife noticed: “What’s his problem?” she wondered aloud.

Now, two paragraphs ago, I stated that I always follow the rules. I must admit that I sometimes take liberties. In this instance, while driving down the ramp to the 403, instead of accelerating slowly so that I’d be going the posted speed limit of 100 km/h when I reached the merge lane, I had the accelerator pedal down a little further so I was going — ahem — 120 when I pulled onto the highway.

And Mario Andretti behind me, obviously agitated that I hadn’t pulled completely off the road to let him past and was even closer than he’d been previously, just floored it and rocketed past me and across two more lanes of highway till he reached the HOV lane and by then he was going at least 140 and still had the hammer down.

“That boy’s got problems,” I thought, as I eased back to 100-110, like the goody two-shoes I am every time I’m on the highway.

Now, we’ve all had bad thoughts about other drivers. “What a jerk,” we think, or worse. But this time I thought I’d get a learned opinion about what’s really going on in the heads of people who almost seem out of control, or close to it, when it comes to driving.

So I called an old chum, a guy I went to university with way back when, who retired recently as a senior mental health professional with one of the 10 provinces. He requested anonymity, as he’s no longer on the job and doesn’t need the aggravation that controversy can sometimes bring, like: “Why did you put my name in the paper? Have you seen Twitter?”

So I asked him: “What is with these people, anyway?” And this is what he said:

“Your personality is formed in one of two ways, some of which is learned and some of which is hard-wired. It goes back to how you came into the world and how you react to certain stimuli.

“For instance, you can look at some children — line them up in the nursery — and there will be a flash of light or a loud noise. Some will be cool; they won’t react. Others will hear the same noise and they’ll be startled. They’ll start crying because their nervous system gets overloaded more easily.

“So, if you’re hard-wired like that and you’re in an environment that is unpredictable, that could intensify anger. In some cases, you can’t tolerate a lot of tension, which shows itself in different ways: impatience, hostility and aggression, which make people more vulnerable to losing control. Most of us have this in us but we have the self-control to put a stop to it.

“Learned behaviour, on the other hand, is something you’ve seen very early in your life. You see your dad do something and it makes an impression. Those early kinds of experiences are the ones that, unless there’s some sort of positive change, can really get set in.

“We know that during this whole COVID thing, there’s been a lot of stress. People’s tolerances are worn down. The personality vulnerabilities start to come to the fore a bit more. I’m thinking of a former client who was telling me he had to really watch himself and gauge where his anxiety levels were in order to not get into trouble with other people on the road and getting really angry and doing something that would put his family in risk. He wasn’t a road rager but he was able to realize that this was not the better part of who he was.”

I told him I wished more drivers had such insight. In fact, every morning when I listen to the accident reports on 680 News or CP24, I become convinced that most of them are caused by people who don’t have complete control of their emotions, like the guy who tailgated me for blocks and then just missed hitting the back of my truck when he blasted past and onto the 403.

Being on a roll, I continued by saying that I thought it was ludicrous that people are given a licence to drive when they are in their mid-teens and then never have to take another driving examination in their whole life. In fact, I said, people should have to be retested every five years and something should be added: much like people over 80 have to take a dementia test, that every-five-years driver’s exam should include a psychological test and those found to be a ticking time bomb should lose their licence until they go through counselling.

My friend paused, then said that a test makes sense theoretically but he’s not sure if it’s practical. “But it’s a perfectly reasonable question to ask,” he said. “It’s worth talking about and certainly would provoke a lot of thinking, a lot of discussion.”

To many people, that’s all they want to know about tires.

But both Michelin and Pirelli have used the same marketing slogan at various points in time:

“Your tires are the only parts of your car that actually touch the road.”

In other words, tires are not where you should compromise.

A chat last week with Chris Gelinas of OK Tire in Essex, Ont., brought up an issue I had not thought of.

“In these difficult COVID-19 times, when some people are afraid to even leave their homes,” he says, “many people have not got around to switching out their winter tires.”

Winter tires have a more pliable tread compound, designed to conform to varying road surfaces when the temperature dips below about 7 C. They’re not just “snow” tires anymore.

Gelinas points out that running winters all summer, especially in hot weather like we have experienced these past two weeks, could reduce their life by as much as 60 per cent.

By next winter, they’ll probably only be good to nail to your dock to keep your boat from getting scratched, so you’ll have to get new winters anyway.

Make the switch now, and save yourself money in the long run.

Like many businesses, Gelinas’s OK Tire store — officially, “Beau’s All Everything” — has adapted during the pandemic.

Service is by appointment only.

They allow fewer people in the store at any one time.

Each car is thoroughly disinfected before and after servicing.

Each technician wears a new pair of rubber gloves for each car.

They have also gone to an entirely no-touch, paperless billing system. Everything is done using laptops. They take photos of your tires to show you how they look.

“So,” Gelinas says, “don’t be afraid to call for an appointment!”

While these procedures were instituted due to COVID-19, they will likely be permanent because it’s just a better way of doing business.

One thing Gelinas is adamant about — you should check your tire pressures no less than once a month.

Not only might this save you from a calamity if a tire blows, it will improve your gas mileage.

“If the pressures are down by just 2 psi, it can cost you about four per cent in fuel consumption,” he says.

You should also keep an eye on tread depth. If you don’t have a proper tread gauge, a toonie makes a good option.

“Stick it between the tread blocks,” he says. “If the tread comes up to the bear’s paws on the ‘tails’ side of the coin, you’re good.

“If it only covers the silver part of the coin, you’re at about half tread depth, and performance will start to diminish.”

Our conversation went on to include a number of other tire-related issues which we don’t have space to cover here, including “all-season” tires (which I call “no-seasons” because they’re no good in summer and no good in winter either); the newer “all-weather” tires which earn the “green mountain” label and therefore qualify for a premium discount with some insurance companies; tire pressure monitoring systems; and which brands of tires are best (I like Michelins, he likes Toyos, but he will sell you almost any brand, because there is strong brand loyalty in tires).

But we agree on this — a little bit of preventive tire maintenance can make a huge difference.

Not only will it save you money, it will also reduce your chances of being involved in a serious crash.

64,https://www.thestar.com/autos/opinion/2020/06/26/revived-ford-mustang-mach-1-pays-homage-to-heritage.html,6,car drive rear wheel seat race driver road,65,thestar,Revived Ford Mustang Mach 1 pays homage to heritage,'Jim Kenzie',2020-06-26 00:00:00,"Ford is bringing back the Mach 1 model designation on a Mustang after a 17-year hiatus.

First, this is a genuine “Mach” version of a genuine Mustang.

I still can’t believe Ford is using both of those fabled nameplates on a four-door electric truck.

Shame, shame, shame.

Don Frey, chief engineer on the original Mustang, would turn in his grave if he knew what to turn in it for.

The newest Mustang will be a real Mustang. It will be a 2021 model year car and goes on sale that spring.

Prices? Way too soon, but the car will be positioned between the Mustang GT (2020 price, $34,790) and the Shelby GT350 ($76,425).

Obviously a huge gap.

The Mustang Bullitt with which the Mach 1 shares some bits currently lists at $52,500, so my guess for the Mach 1 is somewhere north of that, probably high-50s.

By the way, no confirmation that the Bullitt edition will survive into 2021.

If you want one, it may already be too late.

During an online press conference, Tom Barnes, vehicle engineering manager for Mustang, and Jim Owens, Mustang and Shelby marketing manager, gave a group of Canadian journos some technical details of the new Mach 1.

A revised front end provides extra cooling for both engine and transmission. Some styling tricks like “go-faster” stripes bridge the gap to earlier generations.

As Owens noted, “Anything that bears this badge has to look right, it has to look to its heritage.”

Barnes added, “People who know Mach 1 will say, ‘That’s a Mach 1.’

“People who don’t know Mach 1 will say, ‘That’s a really cool car.’”

Revised trim inside includes a numbered serial plate.

Ford won’t say how many Mach 1s it’ll build, only that it is a “limited edition.”

I couldn’t even get them to say how many digits that serial number would contain...

Those planning to track the car will probably want to opt for the Recaro seats.

Barnes and Owens suggested “balance” is the key to the new Mach 1.

Their mantra is that Mach 1 will be “the pinnacle of Mustang 5.0-litre performance,” the “5.0-litre” caveat necessary because the 5.2-litre flat-plane-crankshaft Shelby GT350 and the supercharged 5.2-litre GT500 will outrun it.

That’s because Mach 1 gets essentially the same 5.0-litre V-8 engine as the Bullitt, providing 480 horsepower at 7,000 r.p.m. and and 420 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,600 r.p.m. Should be good for 0-100 km/h in the low- to mid-five-second range.

It will be mated to a six-speed Tremec manual gearbox, with rev-matching for smooth downshifting.

It also features the cool cue-ball shift knob.

Shiftless types can opt for a 10-speed automatic, which has been massaged for sportier on-road and on-track performance.

Suspension includes MagneRide dampers, still the best in the game in my view, and stiffer steering shaft, sway bars and front springs.

Bigger and better brakes are part of the deal.

19x9.5-inch front and 19x10-inch rear wheels are shod with Michelin PS4 tires.

A Handling Package, available only with the stick shift, brings even fatter wheels and tires, and a host of aerodynamic features which generate 150 per cent more downforce than Mustang GT when equipped with its comparable performance pack.

A rear subframe with stiffer bushings and a rear toe link lifted from the Shelby GT350 will further improve grip.

Underneath, a longer belly pan again aids aerodynamics.

The objective was to make the car fast on the track, but still ultimately “street-able.”

I’d love to tell you if they succeeded, but obviously, a virtual car launch can only tell us so much.

The Ford folks think this car is amazing. But then, they would, wouldn’t they?

I really liked the Bullitt, the GT350 and the GT500, so I imagine the Mach 1 won’t disappoint.

Can hardly wait to confirm that for you.",[],635,0.8803559635589222

The summer seems half over. The pandemic has got us all down. Where to go for some R&R?

Usually, at this time of year, I’m either at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park north of Bowmanville or at Oswego Speedway in New York state with side trips to Indianapolis and Montreal thrown in. I used to tell my friends that instead of a summer cottage, I had a standing reservation for Room 326 at the Best Western Captain’s Quarters in Oswego.

But because of COVID-19, CTMP has had to cancel all its spectator racing programs so far this year and, as of this moment, there will not be a Grand Prix du Canada. The Indianapolis 500 has been postponed until late August and there is still no supermodified racing at Oswego, but it doesn’t matter anyway because I can’t get across the border.

I was thinking about this the other day and I thought that my wife and I could drive down east to visit my sister in Nova Scotia, but then it struck me: Upper Canadians (and everybody else in the country, it seems) are persona non grata these days in the Maritimes.

Out west, I won’t find police at the borders telling me to get lost, but Canada is a huge place and if you meander, it will take you half your holiday to get to Vancouver and then you would have to beat it home to either go back to work or be ready if your employer should call.

Which leaves Ontario, and according to my good friend Bob Verwey, is there any place you’d rather be? “The great thing about the border being closed,” he was telling me the other day, “is that people can get to experience what Ontario has to offer.”

Now, as well as travelling to races during the summer, I have been on the road frequently the past two years to cover the unveilings of new cars. Anybody who’s spent as much time on planes and unfamiliar hotels as I have (and that includes the world-famous Hôtel de Paris in Monte Carlo) knows that you always pack hand wipes to give the TV remote a good cleaning, as well as the telephone receiver and the toilet seat.

Now, with all due respect to the hotels and motels in the cities and towns of Ontario, if I don’t trust places like the Hôtel de Paris to sanitize TV remotes when times are good, I’m not sure I would be too happy booking into any hotel in the midst of a pandemic.

But my pal Mr. Verwey reminded me that there is an alternative: people can take a motorhome holiday.

Full disclosure: Bob Verwey sells motorhomes and travel trailers, and rents them out, at Owasco RV Centre, east of Oshawa. He’s a former president of the Trillium Automobile Dealers Association, which is how I know him.

“You get a motorhome or trailer, it’s disinfected and you can keep it that way,” said Verwey, who also owns three car dealerships and a collision repair centre. “Nobody has to go in there except you and your family. You go into a motel and you think about the virus and who was in the room before you. Not with your motorhome.”

The RV salesman was quickly in full flight. “Some people worry that motorhomes are hard to drive. They’re not. Just get in and drive. All your stuff is in there. You have your plates, forks and knives — everything. You have your stove and fridge. You have your water on board, generators are on board. It’s like your cottage on wheels.

“I was in Florida, at an airport, taking a three-day course (Verwey has a plane and has to take a three-day refresher every year to satisfy insurance and other requirements). We took a motorhome and stayed right in the parking lot. We felt better doing that rather than booking into a motel.”

He said there are plenty of places to park a motorhome or trailer. “Walmart lets you stay in their parking lots because you’re probably going to do your food shopping there and buy other supplies. Truck stops are also free because you‘re going to fuel up. And there are rest stops on the sides of highways all over the province, so you just pull off the road and they all have a place for RVs.”

If you buy, prices for a new trailer that’s perfect for a family of four start at around $20,000. Class A motorhomes (the Taj Mahals of the motorhome set) can run from $140,000 to much higher — but remember: it’s like buying that cottage. If you want to rent, ask Owasco or dozens of other motorhome retailers around the province for a price list.

I’m stuck at home these days, but I’ve always wanted a motorhome. My wife? Not so much. Guess who’s still dreaming?",[],838,0.915371668064496

He said Ford could build a year’s run of F-Series pickup trucks — over a million units — and not build exactly the same truck twice.

They don’t, but it just shows the variation in this product line.

Wheelbase. Length. Box size and configuration. Rear- or four-wheel drive. Trim levels. A host of powertrain configurations. A pages-long option list.

My “King Ranch” tester is the pinnacle of the range, named after a huge ranch in Texas, where, not coincidentally, some 40 per cent of this model is sold.

It starts at $71,949; my tester was optioned to a whopping $83,769. The six-figure pickup truck is not far off...

Given that the base F-150 starts at $30,339 (and discounting is rampant among pickups), this is equivalent to the most expensive house in an inexpensive neighbourhood.

King Ranch comes only in the SuperCrew configuration, with a full rear seat, four big doors, the six-and-a-half-foot box and four-wheel drive.

Concerns were raised when this 13th-generation F-Series launched for the 2015 model year because of its aluminum body. Would it stand up? Could any body shop repair it?

But it’s still the bestselling vehicle in the game. Body shops have to adapt.

My tester had the FX4 off-road package, with electronic locking rear differential, hill descent control, skid plates, off-road front dampers and badging to let your neighbours know you paid more for your truck than they did for theirs.

It was painted a lovely sparkly blue, with King Ranch decals and logos all over the place, inside and out.

You might not think that tan leather upholstery would go with a blue exterior, but it seems to work.

The interior is well-executed, and the matte finish on top of the dash reduces reflections.

An eight-inch screen in front of the driver offers bright, clear tachometer and speedo, with smaller gauges for such as fuel level, coolant temperature and oil pressure in between.

Ford’s SYNC3 control system for SatNav et al. has a vastly faster-reacting touchscreen than earlier iterations, and voice recognition which will take some time to get used to, as these always do.

Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, a Wi-Fi hot spot, USB outlets front and rear, and 110-volt outlets in the dash and in the pickup bed rank among the high-tech features.

Nice round knobs look after the lovely Bang & Olufsen sound system and the dual zone auto AirCon with its four massive dash vents.

The comfy front seats are 10-way power adjustable.

The three-seat rear bench features a fold-down centre console when just two are aboard.

The rear seat cushion lifts to create a floor-to-ceiling cargo area and reveal hidden under-seat storage.

Cup holders and cubby bins galore, and a massive multi-level centre console bin configurable to your personal taste.

Now, when a truck offers power deployable running boards, that’s a sign the truck is too big. But they did make it easier to clamber in and out.

You must stand back when these deploy to ensure they don’t “ankle” you (adapting the term “kneecap” for a lower portion of your leg).

My tester also had side steps behind the rear doors. Kick a lever and these pop out to ease climbing up to see what’s in the box. Unlike the running boards, these do not automatically retract, so make sure you do so before pulling away or you risk “ankling” pedestrians.

The tailgate has a fold-out step ladder to ease access into the bed, which features hooks and tie-down points everywhere. A wide range of accessories is available to aid hauling bikes, canoes, all sorts of kit.

My tester had the 3.5 litre twin-turbo V6, producing 375 horsepower and 470 lb.-ft. of torque. To it was bolted Ford’s 10-speed automatic, which can be set to Normal, Tow/Haul, Snow/Wet, Eco and Sport modes, to optimize performance for each of those aptly-named settings.

The combination gives good performance, and with 10 ratios, you might never see 3,000 r.p.m. if you don’t push it too hard. This should result in decent real-world fuel consumption.

I left the truck in “4x2” mode because I didn’t do any off-roading, and enjoyed nice weather during my test.

In Canada, you will not be so lucky, so a knob on the dash lets you select “4x4 automatic,” which engages the front wheels as it deems necessary; “4x4 high,” which keeps you in “four-by” mode; and “4x4 low” for the really tough going.

My main complaint with the powertrain is the shifter. You must depress a button in the shift knob to release it from Park, but it’s much too easy to pull the lever all the way back to the “M” (for “manual”) position. Then you’ll stay in first gear until you manually select second. Or until you shove the lever one notch back into Drive, where it should have been in the first place. A stronger detent is needed.

Ride quality with the off-road suspension is a bit firm. Unless you’re planning some serious boonie bashing, I’d leave this box on the order form unchecked.

The steering is light, direct and communicative, and the truck is easy to manoeuvre.

But wow, is it big. The large turning circle makes it a handful in the Canadian Tire lot or a parking garage.

A lot of people have difficulty backing up with a trailer attached because you have to steer right to turn the trailer left. With Ford’s system, turn a knob on the dash left if you want to steer the trailer to the left.

Experienced trailer towers will be confused; newbies will love it.

The F-Series passes my side-view mirror adjustment test — you can crank them out far enough to eliminate the no-longer-blind-spots.

But this truck’s blind-spot warning system is actually somewhat relevant because it extends coverage to beside a trailer which might otherwise be hiding an approaching vehicle.

Sadly, like all Fords, it fails the ignition-off/lights-automatically-off test. Come on, people.

My tester included the “Technology” package, which brings the handy overhead 360-degree camera system, a pop-out washer to keep the front grille camera lens clean, and “active park assist” to guide you into a parking spot.

Normally I hate these things — didn’t you have to learn to park to get your licence?

But with a truck this big, you may need all the help you can get.

Oh, did I mention this truck is big?

The pickup truck market is the most brand-loyal in the industry. If you’re a Ford person, you won’t likely consider a Chevy or GMC, and vice versa.

My daughter Dr. Laura (the veterinarian) has always wanted a Ram 4x4. Diesel engine, of course.

Even she was impressed with the F-150 King Ranch.

I can hardly imagine higher praise.

“All-new” Ford F-150 reveal

In an online presentation earlier this week, Ford introduced what it is calling the “all-new” 2021 F-Series pickup truck, which will go on sale somewhere around the end of this year.

“All-new”?

Well, the 3.5-litre V-6 hybrid engine is new. The 10-speed automatic is now standard across the board. The infotainment system is now SYNC4 and is an in-house Ford product, replacing the BlackBerry QNX platform used previously.

The console-mounted shift lever can be folded down to allow deployment of a huge working surface for laptops and other gear.

Presumably not when you are driving.

Seats that fold flat into makeshift beds so you never have to go home.

More self-driving technologies — just what we need in a huge truck on our crowded highways.

A bunch of upgrades to the pickup box and to in-cab storage systems.

On-board electric power availability for work site or campsite equipment.

Oh yes, the available deployable running boards now go all the way to the back of the truck, eliminating the need for the side step-up assist thing I mention in the review of the 2020 F-Series elsewhere today.

Wow. Call the Nobel Prize committee.

Ford researches the daylights out of its truck customers. No doubt these will be useful modifications to this vehicle.

In today’s COVID-19-ravaged environment, a group ride-and-drive is pretty much out of the question. So the product presentations have become virtual, using apps like Skype or Zoom. These allow us to learn about, hence report on, what the manufacturers think about their new babies.

But we can’t draw much in the way of our own conclusions because we can’t drive them.

Better than nothing?

Let’s see.

One such event was the recent virtual launch of the 2021 Nissan Rogue.

We were joined by Nissan executives Steve Milette (president), Scott Pak (senior manager, product planning), Marcel Guay (senior manager, marketing) and Adam Paterson (director, marketing).

The compact Rogue has been the MVP on Nissan’s team, leading the company’s sales since 2012.

The third generation will arrive in showrooms this fall.

Prices have not been announced, but given the ultracompetitive nature of this huge segment, they aren’t expected to be much different from the current range, which is $27,498 to $37,998.

Nissan is confident in the styling of the new truck. The “V-motion” grille, a motif seen on other recent Nissans, is perhaps the main differentiator in a field where, frankly, most people would have trouble telling one from another if you took the badges off.

Rogue is pretty much all-new. Increased use of ultra-high-strength steel (from 19 per cent of the body to 35 per cent), aluminum (hood, front fenders, door skins) and composites (tailgate) yield a body that’s 27 per cent stiffer. Yet the finished product weighs around 40 kilograms less, which is even more impressive when you consider the extra equipment on the new model.

The 2.5-litre four-cylinder engine, while the same size as before, is in fact a new engine, shared with Altima. It provides 181 horsepower and 181 lb.-ft. of torque.

The continuously variable transmission has been re-engineered to reduce internal friction by 29 per cent, which should improve fuel consumption.

A multi-link rear suspension should benefit both ride and handling.

Rogue offers front-drive models in the two lower trim levels (S and SV). Four-wheel drive is standard in Platinum, and available on the other two grades. It runs mainly as a front-driver, but can quickly send torque to the rear wheels as deemed necessary.

Classier-looking interiors offer more room. Nissan’s justly praised NASA-inspired “Zero Gravity” seats are now fitted front and rear.

Loads of storage spaces everywhere, and one-litre water bottles will even fit in the door pockets.

Although some in this class offer three rows of seating, Rogue remains a five-seater. Each of the rear seats has child safety seat attachment points.

The rear doors open 85 degrees, making the loading of stuff, kiddies and notably those child safety seats much easier.

Privacy shades are available for those rear seats, too — unheard of in this class.

The “divide and hide” trunk allows hiding your valuables. There’s even a spot back there for a 3.7-litre bottle of windshield washer fluid, apparently a Canada-only thing.

Nissan seems particularly proud of the 31.2 inches of total screen in the Platinum trim level in this car.

That’s 12.3 for the digital dashboard, nine for the central display and 10.8 for the head-up display, which of course doesn’t count for me because I always switch them off.

Three-zone AirCon (front left, front right, rear seat) helps everyone stay comfy.

Also available is a magic Bose 10-speaker sound system.

Nissan claims the focus in the inside was on quietness. Wind, road and engine noise have been handled with such as acoustic laminated glass, the stiffer body shell and a thicker insulation pad on the firewall.

Nissan’s nanny systems include emergency braking forward and backward, something called “cut-in” protection (somebody must drive on the 401).

With the PROPILOT Assist with Navi-Link in the Premium trim, an auto-resume in the cruise control system will re-accelerate the car even if it has been sitting for up to 30 seconds.

If you drive a lot in heavy traffic, you’re gonna love this.

Nissan pioneered the simulated overhead camera view, which makes parking in tight spots much easier.

Rogue has “tech” covered with a wireless phone charger, a Wi-Fi hot spot, four USB ports, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, standard on all trim levels.

Nissan will continue to aim Rogue at Toyota RAV-4 and Honda CR-V, which remain two of the bestselling vehicles in our market.

On paper, it looks like it will make a good case for itself.

Nothing more.

When I was a teen in Niagara Falls, I sold men’s and boys’ clothing in summer at the long-gone Rosberg’s Dept. Store. The pay was good for a high school kid and I learned a lot of life lessons in that place.

I’ve mentioned him before, but a man who had a profound influence on my life was my manager, Morris (Mo) Feinberg. He’s the guy who said to me: “Remember, the customer comes first, even before your mother. And the customer is always right.”

I never forgot that.

When the pandemic struck, my local Ford store called and cancelled an appointment I’d made to have them give my truck the once-over and to change my tires from winter to summer. “We’ll be in touch when we’re open again,” the woman who’d called me said.

Two or three weeks ago, while driving past, I’d noticed they’d reopened. “They’ll call me and book an appointment,” I thought. “That’s what they’d said they’d do.”

About a week after that, I got a text: “Hey Norris, if you haven’t booked your vehicle in for service yet, this is just a friendly reminder to get in touch with us.”

“Gee,” I thought, “they called me to cancel and said they’d be in touch when they were back in business. They opened up and didn’t call me and now I have to call them.”

I called and made an appointment.

Now, pre-pandemic, if you took your vehicle in for servicing, you had a choice: you could wait or they would shuttle you home and pick you up when the job was done. Good customer service. But it’s a different world now. Nobody wants to get sick with COVID-19. When I arrived at my dealer’s, I had to park the truck, lock it and put the keys in an envelope that went through a slot. That was it. I was then on my own.

I don’t live dozens of kilometres away from that Ford store, but it’s a long walk. It’s a pain to take public transit because I would have to wait for a bus and then change to another to get to the street where I live. So I called a cab. (I always carry a mask, rubber gloves and sanitizer with me when I go out, so I felt safe.) And I had to call a cab to go back. And the tab for servicing, plus tire storage, an alignment and some brake work, plus labour and tax, came to just under $900.

When I saw the bill, I said to myself that for $900, they should have provided me with transportation, at the very least.

By coincidence, the very next day I got a call from a friend of mine who owns several auto dealerships in the GTA. He is suffering from serious Formula One withdrawal and wanted to talk about his addiction. Without telling him about my personal experience, I asked him what he did for customers coming in for service.

“We’ve cleared out our showrooms and put up some cubicles because social distancing is very important,” he said. “If someone can wait for their car, they can sit in there and read a book, or something. When they leave, we disinfect for the next guest. Meantime, if the work is going to take longer than a couple of hours, we call an Uber and send them home and then we Uber them back when their car is ready.”

“Ah, the difference in customer service,” I thought. “My friend owns dealerships and has concern; my Ford store is owned by a corporation, which doesn’t.”

If Mo Feinberg was still around, he’d have words with them.

There is another way, of course. What if you could have your car serviced at home? In your driveway, or parking place at your apartment or condo? The service people could come to you. And that’s where LubeVan Mobile Auto Services Inc. (lubevan.ca) came in. I had a fascinating chat this week with Ryan Dach, who founded the business, and Matthew Bingley, the president of the company that services vehicles in the GTA and Hamilton.

They — and there are other similar services out there, although not many — do everything that dealerships do so far as servicing your vehicle is concerned — oil, filters, latch lubrication, check all fluids, rotate your tires and so on. They will change your summer tires to winter and back again and will store the tires for you.

The big jobs — brakes, milky coolant that has to be drained — they don’t touch but will refer you to a proper shop if you don’t know of one. “Nobody should be doing anything surrounding coolant or antifreeze out in the street; it’s a very dangerous thing for the environment,” Dach said. “We want to be responsible in everything we do.”

And while their prices are slightly higher (example: oil and filter = $65 plus tax), they are not out of line and are worth it for the extra convenience.

Just like my engineering class’s quarterly lunch meeting last week.

Why do I mention that?

Simply because it showed the advantages of using the internet to cyber-connect with like-minded people.

In our class meeting’s case, it allowed more of us to communicate with more of our classmates than a physical meeting would.

First, it enabled those who live far from Toronto to participate. Also, at a “physical” lunch, you’re pretty much chatting only with the three or four people seated closest to you. With the virtual setup, you have more flexibility and can cover more ground.

Likewise with the virtual Yorkville Exotic Car Show, which we have planned for Sunday, starting at 1 p.m. EDT.

You don’t have to be in the GTA to enjoy it, because you can view it live using Instagram.

Just search for the account @yorkvilleecs (for “Yorkville Exotic Car Show”) on Instagram. You can then pick up the live video, which will appear in the upper left-hand corner of the page. At least, that’s what I’ve been told! If you have any issues, find a teenager...

On this virtual show, we will have sessions with a wide variety of automotive experts.

Ron Fellows, one of Canada’s best-ever race car drivers, a member of the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame and a recipient of the Order of Canada, will be showing you the new Corvette C8 from the fabulous Mosport circuit. (OK, it is officially “Canadian Tire Motorsports Park,” but it will always be “Mosport” to me.)

At press time, we were not sure whether Ron would be able to drive the car on the track on Sunday. He and I share at least one thing — we both have driven it, on a racetrack (the Spring Mountain circuit in Nevada where Ron runs his racing school). And we agree — it is beyond brilliant.

Speaking of brilliant, a Porsche 935, the twin-turbo purpose-built race car version of the 911, will be displayed by Steve Bortolotti, manager for Pfaff Motorsports. The 935 won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race overall in 1979, and Steve will tell you how it did it.

Yours truly will be on the show, live from Legendary Motorcar Company in my hometown of Milton.

Among the vast array of fantastic cars that Legendary’s owner Peter Klutt has assembled is an extremely rare Ferrari F50 — one of just 399 ever built. I’ll give you a walk-around of this wonderful carbon-fibre-chassis car, the likes of which few car freaks will ever see in person.

Is it red? Does a bear ... well, never mind. Yes, it is “rosso corsa” — “racing red.”

I’m trying to figure out how to jump into it and drive it away. The fact that it’s on the second floor of Legendary poses a bit of an issue.

Vajid Khan is chair of Cars & Chai, a car club whose members apply their passion for fine cars to do good works in the community, such as delivering meals to front-line workers during this pandemic. He will feature his Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, a car you’re not likely to see often in the streets of — well, anywhere, actually.

Over the years, the Yorkville Exotic Car Show has raised money for Prostate Cancer Canada (PCC). Guys like cars. So do many women. But only guys get prostate cancer.

Phil Downe, the founder and chair of the show, notes that to date, the event has raised over $300,000 towards fighting this scourge. PCC is now a part of the Canadian Cancer Society, so the show’s beneficiary is now the CCC.

In these current times, it’s difficult to get much traction about any disease that isn’t COVID-19. But the fact remains that prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer among Canadian men. And one of the most frustrating aspects of it is that to a considerable extent, it is treatable, often curable.

The key to either is early detection.

Adding to the frustration is that there is a test that helps determine if you are afflicted. The PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) test is a simple procedure that can give you that critical early warning sign.

The Yorkville Exotic Car Show on Father’s Day has particular significance for me.

First, I am a father — four kids, who are wonderful, thanks mainly to their mom.

Second, I obviously love cars. They are my passion, my livelihood.

Third, I’ve been with the Star for a while now, and the Star is the official media sponsor of the event.

And, I am in that age range, over the age of 60 (yes, I know, hard to believe...), which has to be most concerned about this disease.

Personally, I am on what my doctor calls “active surveillance” — no symptoms or other issues to worry about so far, but it’s a way of circumventing the ridiculous situation in Ontario that prostate cancer tests are otherwise not covered by OHIP.

All other provinces except British Columbia’s Medical Services Plan (MSP) cover them.

Why not Ontario and B.C.?

You will have to ask your MPP.

I mean, berate your MPP.

So especially if you are over the age of 40, doubly especially if there’s a history of prostate cancer in your family — get tested.

Women, encourage the men in your life — husbands, fathers, sons, uncles, cousins, boyfriends, just plain friends — to get tested.

Younger people, tell the older men in your lives — get tested.

It sometimes isn’t an easy subject to bring up. But it’s a lot easier than writing something nice to say at their funeral.

Did I mention — get tested?

True, there have been some issues raised about the efficacy of testing. False positives can sometimes lead to unnecessary treatment.

But it’s still the best weapon we have.

Also, depending on how old you are, the sad fact is that something else might get you before prostate cancer does; despite the advances of modern medical science, the death rate is still 100 per cent.

But there’s no point in checking out before your time is due.

So — get tested. And also be sure to join us Sunday at 1 p.m. on Instagram.

It might cost money, but it will be worth it. The insurance companies will love it, because they are sick and tired of being ripped off by the vultures out there. And Ford would likely win re-election in a walk because anybody (and there are many) who’s ever been taken to the cleaners by those outlaws will thank him with their votes.

I was driving down a ramp leading to the eastbound 401 the other day when a grey tow truck just blew past me. It was as if I was standing still. I knew immediately where he was going.

There had been a call for a tow truck further along the 401. And this guy was racing to get to the scene before other tow-truck drivers arrived.

To the winner would go the spoils.

Be assured, there are hundreds of tow-truck companies in Ontario that are honest. You can count among them those connected with the CAA. But there are still way too many crooks and unscrupulous people out there.

The “racing to the scene” I talked about two paragraphs ago is just the beginning. Those thieves are masters at taking advantage of emotionally upset motorists who’ve just been in a crash by hooking up the car (or cars) in question and taking them to the shop of a person with whom they’re in cahoots.

Although, because of legislation, the tow truck is required to post its rates, what unsuspecting motorists often aren’t ready for are hidden charges, like fees to hook up, to unhook and storage while they, or their insurance company, make arrangements to have the vehicle repaired. Which could mean another tow and a whole new set of charges.

Want to pay for the repairs yourself, so that your insurance doesn’t go up? Some body shops will give you an itemized bill, but not the one you’d been expecting. The damage and repair costs are often much higher than originally estimated.

These might seem like exaggerations, but they happen all the time.

The legislation I mentioned was set in motion in 2014 and finally became law in 2018. The laws are fine, so far as they go, but if you’re a crook, they don’t mean a lot. Those guys are professional liars (“I just called CAA on your behalf, sir, and they want you to know that, so as not to hold up traffic, it is OK for me to tow you. I will take you to a really good repair shop I know and they will look after reporting the collision for you”).

And you, as upset as you are, will probably say, “Yes, of course,” because if you said, “No,” they wouldn’t be in business long.

It never fails to amaze me that when there’s an accident on the highway you have the police, an ambulance service, a fire department and several tow trucks on scene. Three are public and the fourth is private. Why is that? Particularly when the evidence of skulduggery frequently committed by the fourth is so overwhelming.

That organized crime is involved is no longer in doubt. York Regional Police recently arrested 20 people and laid charges dealing with, among other things, murder, arson and threats in relation to a turf war and staging serious, multi-car crashes in order to file phoney insurance claims.

Rules and regulations rarely work. It’s up to municipalities to police the industry, but according to the CAA, fewer than 20 of more than 400 municipalities actually have laws clear enough to be enforced. Which means everywhere else is ripe for corruption. For instance, several Ottawa police officers were recently charged for receiving kickbacks from tow-truck drivers; Star investigations have found GTA officers to be involved in the same way.

The only way to clean up this mess is to eliminate the problem. Make tow trucks a division of policing, or EMS, or fire departments. The premier himself was quoted as saying after those 20 charges were laid that, “We’re coming for you and we’re going to catch you. The party’s over.”

This has been building for years and the time is now ripe to do something. Don’t just catch them, premier. Put them out of business. Make the industry a public service and be done with it.

Pros: Stunning interior; excellent ride/handling balance; strong, serene performance.

Cons: Shift lever must be fixed; may not have parking lot attendant cred; not much else.

If you are considering a luxury sedan and don’t give the Genesis G90 a look, you are either prejudiced, misled or uninformed.

The G90 at $89,750 can hold its own against anything.

Yes, Genesis is the upscale division of Hyundai.

Yes, it’s built in Korea.

But it has no shortage of international credentials. The head of the entire company and its design chief (Peter Schreyer) and chief engineer (Albert Biermann) are German. The four-wheel drive system is Canadian (Magna).

It would look as good in front of Monaco’s Hotel de Paris as it would in a Canadian Tire parking lot.

The G90 has been extensively upgraded for 2020. Virtually all the sheet metal except the doors has been changed.

The major visual differences are the massive new grille and unique 1.5-foot “G-Matrix” aluminum wheels.

This interior is swathed in top-quality quilted Nappa leather.

Gorgeous open-pore wood trim and matte-finished metal controls and accents are other highlights.

The front seat occupants get plush yet supportive thrones, 22-way adjustable for the driver, 16 for shotgun. If you can’t get comfy, you haven’t tried hard enough.

There’s plenty of space for four NBA stars, with room for a mascot in the middle rear seat. Unless the other two occupants fold the centre arm rest to gain access to their own HVAC and radio controls.

Rear-side and back window shades give added privacy.

The Thin Film Transistor LCD instrument cluster features tachometer and coolant temperature on the left, speedo and fuel level on the right.

In between, you can select from a wide range of displays.

The mid-dash 12.3-inch touchscreen is bright and clear.

The commands for the voice-activated control system for features such as SatNav seem more intuitive than most in my experience.

A set of push buttons and a rotating knob in the centre console allow access to even more functions. The most commonly used ones like sound system and HVAC are replicated with dedicated buttons so you don’t have to page through a dozen screens to find what you’re looking for.

It may take a while to learn all the touching, swiping, scrolling, pinching and zooming gestures, but I found it easier than many of this ilk.

A lovely analog clock sits proudly in the centre of the dash, and provides an educational opportunity for parents to teach their children what “clockwise” means.

The G90 has connectivity covered, with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and USB outlets all over the place.

The 5.0-litre naturally aspirated V-8 provides 520 horses and 383 lb.-ft. of torque. That latter value comes in at a high 5,000 r.p.m., but the eight-speed automatic provides enough flexibility that the car never feels undergunned.

Steering wheel shift paddles give G90 owners the opportunity to be a more active participant in the festivities.

Or not; it shifts fine by itself.

Magna’s contribution is the full-time four-wheel drive system that directs torque to whichever wheels can best utilize it.

It is rear-axle biased to provide what most customers perceive to be sportier handling.

Four drive modes tailor things like throttle response, transmission shift speed, suspension, steering effort and four-wheel drive traction distribution to suit.

“Eco,” “Comfort” and “Sport” settings are self-explanatory; “Custom” lets you select the combination that best suits your driving style.

The five-link front and rear suspensions deliver excellent ride, and a level of handling you might not expect from a large luxury sedan.

The car has all the so-called “safety” systems that customers seem to want.

Personally, I think people should learn how to drive so they can enjoy driving as much as we enthusiasts do.

The no-such-thing-as-a-blind-spot warning system is as usual pointless, although market research says people like it.

The G90 adds a camera view in the instrument cluster showing you what’s already visible in the side-view mirror, and adds a redundant level of complexity to that screen.

If you have to rely on the “lane following” system that automatically steers for you, you really should let someone else take the wheel.

It’s not that I hate technology. The overhead camera view makes parking in tight quarters much easier. Rear cross-traffic assist can see things you may not be able to see. The forward collision warning system can spot cyclists and pedestrians, which might not otherwise be visible.

Lead/follow cruise control can be a boon in heavy traffic.

The “Safe Exit Assist” system uses sensors to take a peek behind the car when someone opens a rear door, and sounds a chime if something is approaching.

The “Smart Trunk” enables hands-free operation to ease loading of bulky objects.

But the in-windshield head-up display is, as always, just distracting, and draws your eyes away from looking down the road.

I shut this off.

So should you.

On the road, a wide variety of sound deadening and isolating techniques and a rigid body structure contribute to a driving experience that can best be described as “serene.”

Crank up the terrific 900-watt 17-speaker Lexicon sound system and waft away.

The dual personality of the G90 is revealed when you select “Sport” mode. Every control responds more adroitly, the exhaust note is more aggressive and the big car turns into quite the athlete.

Again, the idea of an NBA star comes to mind. How do those giants move so fluidly?

Complaints?

Obviously, not many.

The most obvious (and it’s frankly inexcusable) is a shift lever that somebody thinks is better than PRNDL.

It isn’t.

To select Park in the G90, you have to push a separate button.

My question, as always, is — why?

Sorry; it’s just stupid, and there aren’t many stupid things in this car.

The bottom line is that this car performs, rides and handles as well as more famous luxury-branded cars, which can cost 50 to 100 per cent more.

“I remember my mother shoving me out of the house to get some fresh air, but all I wanted to do was draw,” he reminisced during an hour-long phone chat we shared, socially distanced by the several thousand kilometres between his office in London, England, and mine in Milton.

When he was 11 and living in Istanbul, he was walking through town with his dad. They came across a Ferrari Dino. “I stood there for 15 minutes, staring at that car. Dad finally had to lead me away, tears in my eyes.”

That’s when he decided he wanted to sketch only cars.

He’s been doing it ever since, in the process becoming one of the giants of the car design world.

Following high school and six years travelling around the world racing motorcycles (he still takes his bike out, but only on nice days), he decided to give car design a shot.

He applied and was accepted into the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, Calif.

“Just getting in there is tough,” he says. “If you graduate, you’re pretty much set for life. The school prepares you very well for the rigours of product design.”

Thirty students started the four-year program with him. Only six graduated.

His fellow alumni included Grant Larson, who designed the first Porsche Boxster, and Ken Okuyama, who did the Ferrari Enzo.

Heady company.

“When I was halfway through the program, Ford offered to pay for my schooling, which I was happy to accept. When I graduated, I started with them in their European design studio in Cologne, Germany.”

One of his first projects was the Ford Escort RS Cosworth. The development of the three-level rear spoiler on the car, subsequently reduced to two, is the subject of one of his YouTube videos. Don’t miss it.

He subsequently worked for a number of companies, including BMW (where he did the X5 SUV, for which I guess I have to forgive him), Ferrari (FXX), Maserati (MC12) and McLaren (P1).

Unlike a lot of car-star designers, Frank also worked on “people’s cars.” The new MINI and the Fiat 500, the reimagining of two of the most iconic cars of the 20th century, both came about under his direction.

I first met Frank at the Paris Auto Show in 2000, where the featured unveiling was that new MINI.

He still bristles about how some commentators at the time viewed this car.

“I was really peed off ...” — about as close to swearing as he gets — “when people said it was a ‘retro’ design.

“Of the 15 designs that were proposed for the car,” he recalls, “some looked nothing at all like the original.

“I didn’t want to copy the old one, but didn’t want to throw away all aspects of it either. You need some sort of a family feeling, a link to the heritage, like the way we relate to our parents and grandparents.”

He talks about the “Golden Ratio,” the number 1.618, also known as “Phi.” This ratio is found in nature and in classic architecture such as the Parthenon in Athens.

He points out that great music also follows that ratio. Beethoven figured it out, and he was so deaf he thought he was a painter.

Not surprisingly then, this number is also found in the length-to-height ratio of the Minis, both old and new.

At last year’s “MINI Invasion,” a celebration of the original’s 60th anniversary, I had the rare opportunity to see both cars side by side. Not until then did I really notice how tiny the original was.

But I also could see certain features — wheels at the corners, short overhangs, “floating” roof and, most of all, those “golden ratio” proportions, which show the family resemblance Frank was seeking.

I can’t draw a straight line with a ruler, so I am always amazed how designers can toss a few lines on a piece of paper and BAM — there’s a car.

He has an idea for a book called “The Three Lines,” where he would take some of the iconic car designs of history and show how you can express them with just three strokes of a pencil.

“If you can draw a car in three lines, you pretty much have a good design,” he says. “The cars that don’t last have lines going all over the place. There’s too much going on.

“Some modern designs seem intended to shock, and they will age badly,” he believes.

One common concern about car design these days is that cars are all designed in a wind tunnel in search of better aerodynamics, hence, better fuel consumption. Won’t they all start looking even more alike than they already do?

Frank points out that what looks “aero” isn’t necessarily “aero.”

“We actually have more freedom now w/r/t aerodynamics than we did before,” he says. “Advances in computational fluid dynamics give us the opportunity to prove that a car that looks aerodynamic might not necessarily be so.

“New approaches to air flow give stylists more freedom than we thought we had.”

He also looks towards the animal kingdom for inspiration.

“Form doesn’t follow function,” he says, turning a design cliche on its head.

“Form IS function. I strive for natural shapes that don’t shock you, but are timeless.”

He likes the term “bio-mimicry.” Millions of years of evolution must have taught us something.

“The cheetah’s design has evolved to let it run fast. That’s how it survives. That’s the true test.”

He makes what sounds like quite a leap when he starts talking about warplanes.

“They are designed for one thing. They do it well.”

To him, that’s successful design.

Aviation is clearly another of this polymath’s interests. He has been working with a company which is developing a battery-powered aircraft that features VTOL — Vertical Takeoff and Landing.

Not much grass grows under Frank Stephenson’s feet.

He thinks a lot about how to stimulate creativity in children. Proportion seems to be innate in creative people, and everybody seems to have it when they are young. Does formal schooling turn that tap off?

“Kids are curious!” he marvels. “Somehow, we switch it off.”

Educators, take heed.

Frank Stephenson’s influence on car design is perhaps best reflected in a current web-based voting scheme, organized by whom, I have no idea. It purports to name the top car designer of all time.

From a list of 64 nominees which includes such as Harley Earl of General Motors who pretty much invented car design as a profession, Nuccio Bertone of the styling house that bears his name, and Peter Schreyer who brought European design ethic to Korea, Stephenson has reached “The Final Four.”

And, he is the only non-Italian in that quartet, the others being Giorgetto Giugiaro, Battista (Pinin) Farina and Leonardo Fioravanti.

Again, heady company.

I have no idea when or how the ultimate winner will be chosen.

If it were Frank Stephenson, I for one would not argue.",[],1166,0.9025290103895269

First things first, I guess.

This is, apparently, historic in that it is the biggest one-year expansion of the bike network in Toronto’s history. Just the sort of thing you slide through when people aren’t paying attention.

In any event, I wanted to double-check the facts for this column so I googled “bike lanes Toronto” and a local news site called Toronto.com popped up.

The main story was about the bike-lane expansion, but that wasn’t what caught my eye. Right across the top of Toronto.com was an ad for a 2020 Kia Sorento. Even better, in the shoulder of the story, was another ad for the same car. There wasn’t an ad for a bicycle anywhere on that page. Just car ads (there was another one at the bottom). Now we know which of these two modes of transportation pays the freight around here.

In any event, the story said — and I quote — that the bike lanes will make it easier for commuters to get to and from work during the COVID-19 crisis. Somebody should tell council that nobody is at work during the crisis, including them. They did this while holding a virtual meeting.

I imagine they got these brainwaves after reading stories that were in the Star recently. There was one that caught my eye in which urban designers imagine a car-free road network in post-pandemic Toronto.

This Freedom Ring Road would encircle the city and allow people in wheelchairs, or pushing baby carriages, or walking and cycling to visit the Brickworks on Bayview or attend an open-air yoga class in the middle of Queens Quay. All without fear of being hit by a car.

Will somebody please tell these people that this is not California. We live in Canada. Even in a good winter, it is either too cold to ride a bike or there is snow on the ground five months of the year. Sometimes six.

Yes, some people cycle 12 months a year. Not many, but some. At the Star, there are two that I know of; at the Globe, one guy not only cycled to work each and every day but he and his family always took a January vacation in a noninsulated cabin north of Kenora that didn’t have electricity. (They sure didn’t have to worry about black flies, did they? But the outdoor privy must have been something else.)

Downtown, in the old city of Toronto, is where the cyclists live. And there, within reason, is where there should be bike lanes everywhere. I say within reason because University Avenue south of Bloor is not a good reason. It will prove to be dangerous because it’s a major thoroughfare for traffic coming into and going out of Toronto.

It reminds me of one of the most famous thoroughfares in Europe, the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The Ontario legislature at Queen’s Park is about where the Arche de Triomphe would be. You can get over to Queen’s Park on crosswalks or at intersections; it’s virtually impossible to get to the Arch because it’s in the middle of a traffic circle.

Which reminds me: would the bicycle lobby quit saying things like, “We should be reducing or eliminating cars and car parking on our main boulevards, as is the case throughout Europe.” They say this knowing that not all that many GTA residents have been to Europe. I have. Many times, particularly in the last two years. Cars are everywhere. See my reference to the Champs-Élysées as just one example. And they park on those streets, too.

My take: Most on council forget that Toronto is a megacity. It is more than the Lake up to Bloor and Parliament in the east over to Bathurst. It’s the Rouge River to the 427 and north to the 407 (approx.) and if you’re living out there and working downtown you are not going to ride your bike. Nor are the people commuting in from Oakville and Whitby, or Kitchener and Peterborough. Those people are not Lance Armstrong; they ride the GO and the bus and subway and most of all they drive. That’s right. They drive.

When the pandemic wanes, and it will sooner or later, and the people who can’t work from home go back to the office, they will not be crazy about riding transit. Not for awhile, anyway. Which means they are going to be driving their cars. In fact, dealers are reporting that people are buying again. May sales were way up over April’s. And once they get used to driving those cars downtown again, it will be a long time before they give them up.

City Council has been living in a dream world for years. Times have been good and Toronto’s on top. It might not be, after the pandemic. Those folks would be wise to pay a little less attention to the bike lobby, which isn’t all that big, and a lot more to the car crowd, which is huge.",[],864,0.9170852233568639

They would take guys like me, sometimes as many as 20 men and women, and fly us out to Newfoundland (Porsche) or Yukon (Subaru) or Utah (Mercedes) or New Mexico (Infiniti) and they would pull back the curtain and then have company experts explain what was new and exciting about whatever.

Then we would drive the new product around for a day or so before flying home.

That was then and this is now. Now is when the unveiling is virtual and, if we’re lucky, we later get to examine a car that’s sitting quietly in a display space in a company showroom. What’s missing, of course, is the drive, which is the really important part.

But giving the product the once-over is better than nothing and that was the case in recent days when I was invited to Toyota Canada headquarters to take a closer look at the new for 2021 Toyota Venza two-row crossover SUV, which will be at dealerships in August.

Right off the bat, let me say this is a fine-looking car and, although the one I sat in was a prototype, feels functional and comfortable.

There is room for five and the company says it will deliver sedan-style driving comfort along with SUV versatility. I spent much of my time the day I was there with Philippe Crowe, a Toyota product consultant, who showed me around the car and emphasized that the Venza is equivalent to the bestselling RAV4, but will be more upscale.

I came away convinced that the automaker is particularly pleased with five offerings: the hybrid powertrain, the car’s electronic all-wheel drive, the safety package, the entertainment and connectivity package and the coup de grâce: a panoramic glass roof.

The hybrid powertrain system (Hybrid System II) matches a 2.5-litre, four-cylinder engine with three electric motors that deliver 219 horsepower and a manufacturer-estimated 5.9 L/100 km in LE trim. (XLE and Limited are the other trims available in Canada.)

There are four driving modes: EV (which means the vehicle can be driven at low speed for a short distance using just the electric motors), ECO (which allows the driver to maximize mileage), Sport (arguably more fun to drive, but making that 5.9L/100 km fuel economy challenging) and Normal (for everyday driving).

Toyota is particularly proud of its Electronic On-Demand, All-Wheel Drive. Two front motors drive the front wheels and a rear-mounted electric motor powers the rear wheels. Torque distribution varies with road conditions.

Toyota Safety Sense (TSS 2.0) is a suite of safety systems that includes a pre-collision program with pedestrian detection and daytime bicycle detection.

Toyota’s cutting-edge entertainment and connectivity is an industry leader. Premium Audio with Remote is standard on XLE and Limited trims and features a 12.3-inch multimedia touchscreen that is almost at eye level and can be operated by either the driver or the front-seat passenger.

Audio Plus with Remote is standard on LE and includes an eight-inch touchscreen.

Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are available, as is Bluetooth. The six-speaker audio with four-channel amplifier is standard. The JBL Premium Audio System is optional, but has nine speakers, a rear subwoofer and 12-channel, 1,200-watt amp. Wow. The Star Gaze (which is trademarked) panoramic glass roof, a Toyota original, is sure not your average sunroof. It brightens the interior while reducing direct sunlight. The electrochromic glass technology lets drivers switch from transparent to frosted modes in, literally, a second.

Other features: 18-inch and 19-inch wheels are available, depending on trims; creature comforts include cupholders that can hold large drinks and door bottle holders that can handle 700 ml bottles. There’s 1,027 litres of cargo space behind the rear seat. There are eight airbags, including side-curtain airbags for both rows of seats. Traction control, an anti-lock braking system and Smart Stop Technology add to the vehicle’s safety. There are LED lights fore and aft. Side mirrors are attached to the door rather than the pillar to better match your line of sight. The rear-view mirror can be, well, a mirror or a screen fed by a rear-mounted camera.

The big selling point for Crowe, though, is the hybrid. “I really like the torque you get from the electric motors when all four wheels are empowered,” he said.

“And I enjoy the hybrid because I don’t have to stop for an hour to charge it like I would with a full electric. I can stop for five minutes and fill up the gas tank.”

Vinh Pham, manager of product planning for Toyota, agreed. “The intermediate SUV segment is growing,” he said. “The hybrid powertrain with the phenomenal fuel economy that it gets is exactly what the segment is looking for.”

Stephen Beatty, vice-president of sales and marketing, didn’t want to talk about pricing. “I won’t even put a number on it,” he said. “As always, we negotiate the price with Japan right up until the final minute.” But then he added: “This is RAV4-sized, the hybrid powertrain is from the RAV4, and there are more features ... ”

So go to Toyota.ca and click on “Build & Price” for the RAV4, which has an MSRP of around $32,000 on the low end up to $42,000. That should give you some idea of what the Venza will go for come August.

Americans say “SPOR-tidge.”

Up here, it’s more likely to be “spor-TAHGE,” with the em-PHA-sis on the second syl-LAB-ble.

Also gives a distinctly French slant to it. Not surprising, given how well Kia does in Quebec.

The fourth-generation Sportage debuted three years ago. Fresh styling and added equipment highlight the changes for 2020.

Prices start at $25,795 for the front-wheel drive LX.

Even at that level, you get useful stuff like heated power side-view mirrors, heated front seats, Android Auto/Apple CarPlay, 12-volt outlets front and rear, two-level trunk with hidden storage and a backup camera with guidelines to ease those tricky reverses.

Another two grand gets you “Dynamax,” among the most clever four-wheel drive systems available.

A product of Canada’s own Magna International, Dynamax uses a series of sensors to automatically engage four-wheel drive when it can be helpful; otherwise, it stays in front-wheel drive to save fuel.

For that nasty cottage access road, you can lock the system into 4x4 mode.

The mid-range EX (4x4 only) at $31,695 brings a bunch of typically useless “driving aids” like “lane-keeping assist.”

(Um, how did you get your driver’s licence?)

And, of course, the “dumb key” fob system, which sadly is almost universal now.

More useful are the 10-way power seats and the heated leather-wrapped steering wheel. (Um again, when is our government going to make this mandatory?)

My EX tester listed at $37,995, which included the “Premium” package (the dreaded leather upholstery, pointless blind-spot warning system, the more useful dual-zone automatic air conditioning, and rear cross-traffic alert), and the “Tech” package (heated rear seats and cooled front ones, a lovely Harman/Kardon sound system with SiriusXM satellite radio, and Kia’s UVO telematics system).

Add $200 for the “Modern Bronze” paint job, plus taxes, freight and A/C charge, and this vehicle will run you $40,080. If you think that’s a lot for a compact SUV, you haven’t been following the market.

The range-topper is the SX Turbo 4x4, which starts at $39,995, but I’ll focus on the one I drove.

Sportage is a handsome thing, given that the two-boxes-on-wheels concept doesn’t give designers much leeway.

One knock: the rear turn signals are way too low in the bumper. Given how many people are driving taller vehicles now, these really must be positioned higher.

That bronze paint gives a luxurious look, which continues inside, with good design executed in high-quality materials. The exception would be the matte black plastic panel for radio and HVAC controls, which looks decidedly low-rent.

The main instrument cluster is a paragon of design and legibility. Big round speedo and tach, with smaller gauges for fuel and coolant temperature nestled within.

The “UVO” touchscreen system is integrated cleanly into the dash, rather than appearing to have been glued on as an afterthought.

Many functions are controlled by buttons on the steering column spokes, some of which can only be changed when the car is in “Park.” Occasionally inconvenient; undoubtedly safer.

It will take some time to find out where all the functions are, but that’s true of any modern car. Lots of adjustability in the seat and steering wheel (reach and rake) to find a good driving position.

Lots of room, too, and real adults can fit in the back seat.

The rear seat-back release levers are down on the floor, rather than on the seat backs themselves, as is more common. The seat split-folds in one-third/two-thirds ratio.

As I do in my VW Golf wagon, I removed the rear-seat headrests when no one was riding back there, to improve rearward visibility.

Lots of cubby bins and cupholders throughout, for real-world driving. An open bin ahead of the shift lever handles miscellaneous debris and includes a USB outlet.

A touch of a button gives you the choice of three drive modes. “ECO” dampens throttle response and isn’t as quick to downshift on light throttle application to maximize economy.

“Sport” gives you the most spirited drive, and the seat side bolsters tighten up a little to give you added lateral support, rare indeed at this price point.

“Normal” splits the difference.

I’d need a month with this vehicle to determine if there is any measurable difference in fuel consumption using these different modes.

My guess: probably not.

The 2.4-litre four-cylinder engine (181 horsepower at 6,000 r.p.m.; 175 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,000 r.p.m.) gives decent performance. But its most remarkable characteristic is how quiet it is — not something you’d usually say about a large-displacement four-banger.

Some credit must go to the sound-deadening “acoustic” glass in the windshield.

The six-speed automatic transmission is properly transparent in operation, shifting seamlessly as needed.

The manual shift feature is backwards, as it is in so many cars. It must be back to upshift, forward to downshift. If I have to tell you why again, you shouldn’t be using it anyway.

Hard to know how much of the Sportage’s nimble handling is down to the trick four-wheel drive system, but it’s a delight, simply going where you point it. Some credit must also go to the Michelin Primacy tires, same ones I have on our Golf.

The steering is accurate and confidence-inspiring.

In sum, the Kia Sportage is a very capable vehicle, and seems to have all the stuff this market wants.

The challenge for Kia is getting people to consider it. This is one of the biggest segments in the Canadian marketplace, with maybe a dozen worthy contenders.

If sprightly handling and high-end features are at the top of your shopping list, Kia’s Sportage is worth a look, no matter how you pronounce it.

Pros: Sharp looks, inside and out; nimble handling; sophisticated four-wheel drive system.

Cons: Rear-turn signal lamps must be repositioned; one measly trim bit on the dashboard takes away from the high-class ambience; manual shift pattern just plain wrong.

Actually in my view, he was the best driver ever. His record on the basis of wins versus starts is exceptional.

He came close to winning the F1 title a couple of times, notably in 1958.

During the Portuguese Grand Prix, Mike Hawthorn had spun and was facing the wrong way. He coasted downhill, bump-started the car, turned around and continued to finish second behind Moss.

After the race, the stewards disqualified Hawthorn because he had technically violated a rule about driving backwards on a track. Moss intervened on Hawthorn’s behalf, and the decision was reversed.

The extra points Hawthorn accumulated were enough at the end of the season to beat Moss for the championship.

I had the honour of meeting Sir Stirling a couple of times.

On the track, he was a “first is first, second is nowhere” type of guy; off the track, a nicer man you would never meet.

I witnessed another example of this duality at a vintage sports car event in Freeport Bahamas, back in 1986.

In the “Unlimited” sports car class, Moss was driving a late-1950s Aston Martin. It might have been the very car in which he had won races in Nassau during the Bahamas Speed Weeks back in the day; if not, it was a contemporary of those cars.

Not surprisingly, he was on pole for the first of two races for this class.

Qualifying second was a young man from Minneapolis named Steve Kline. He was in a 1957 “Echidna,” one of three Minnesota-built sports-racing cars constructed from various late-’50s Chevrolet bits, a “Devin” body, and a Chevy small-block V-8 engine.

After qualifying, the drivers were getting in some extra practice. Kline’s engine blew. He was going to miss the chance to race against the great (not-yet-Sir) Stirling Moss!

He roamed the paddock Friday evening, looking for someone who might have a spare Chevy V-8 for sale.

Lucky for him, he found one.

Not so lucky for him, the guy wanted $10,000.

“That’s a $2,000 engine!” Kline screamed.

“In Minneapolis on Monday morning, it’s a $2,000 engine,” came the reply.

“In Freeport, Bahamas, the Friday night before your race, it’s a $10,000 engine.”

Kline’s father was a Chevrolet dealer in Minneapolis. Those were halcyon days for Chevy dealers. Ten grand wasn’t exactly pocket change, but it wasn’t enough to keep Kline from his date with destiny.

His mechanics were up all night installing it.

Kline had no idea how good the engine was, but at least he’d see the green flag.

He even had a video camera — rare in those days — mounted to his roll bar so he would have a souvenir of the time he raced against Moss. Figuring he had no chance against this legend, the camera was pointed straight ahead.

The course in Freeport was a street circuit, tight and twisty, with a few long straights.

The last corner was a 90-degree left-hander, leading to the start/finish line.

The front row — Moss and Kline, with Moss on the inside — took that corner and headed toward the starter’s flag.

Kline heard Moss start to accelerate. He figured, “I better get on this.”

So he floored it.

Turns out, this engine had way more power than his own. His Echidna surged forward, and was at least 20 metres ahead of Moss as they took the start.

Normally in a situation like this, the starter would wave off the start and require another pace lap.

But what the heck — it’s vintage racing, a preliminary heat, we’re already behind schedule, Moss was surely going to pass him soon anyway.

Throw the flag — let’s go racing.

So Kline led into the first corner.

And every other one.

Moss did everything he could to pass Kline. Every corner, he’d feint one way, then the other.

But Kline was smooth, and had way more power.

Stirling Moss had been beaten by Steve Kline.

Hollywood would never dare write that script.

Of course, his video camera had caught none of this, since Moss was behind him.

I wasn’t at this event to cover the races per se, but I recognize a story when one smacks me in the face.

So I scrambled down to the paddock and met Kline as he climbed out of his car, his crew mobbing him.

He was higher than the proverbial kite.

I asked if he’d like to meet Mr. Moss.

“Um, ah, like, what, er ...” he stammered.

I took that as a “yes.”

So I walked him over to meet Stirling, who wouldn’t have known me from Adam.

But when I introduced him to Kline, he was very gracious.

As tough as he was on a race track, Stirling was always a gentleman off it.

Within moments, they were standing beside each other, the arms of their racing suits tied around their respective waists, just two drivers having a cold one after a hard race.

Somewhere I have photos of this moment. But that was back in the days of “prints.” (Readers under 20 years old, ask your grandparents ...).

I can’t find them anywhere.

At the post-race party that evening, Kline and Moss were chatting with the other drivers and fans. Moss was his usual gallant self, telling everyone that he had done everything he could to pass Kline, but the young man never put a wheel wrong, and he just couldn’t get past him.

“He drove a great race,” Moss said. “But tomorrow, I’m going to teach him lesson No. 2.”

Poor Kline lay awake all night staring at the ceiling, thinking, “I don’t even know what lesson No. 1 was ...”

In the feature race on Sunday, the grid positioning was the same — Moss on the inside of Row 1, Kline on the outside. But as they completed the left turn onto the straightaway towards the start line, Moss moved to his right, cutting Kline off and forcing him to lift.

Moss knew from the previous day’s race that the starter was going to throw the flag no matter what. He grabbed the lead, and Kline never had a chance from that point.

Lesson No. 2.

As it happened, Kline’s Echidna broke a U-joint on the last lap and had to limp home on the limited slip differential.

But what racer wouldn’t give his eye teeth to be 1-for-2 against Stirling Moss on any given weekend?

It was the best 10 grand he ever spent.

And just one of a thousand stories about Sir Stirling Moss.

We will not see his like again.

We got back from 10 days in Florida on March 4 and I turned on the TV to hear Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, suggest that anyone over 70 (check) with an underlying medical condition (check) should plan to stay inside and out of the line of COVID-19 fire for a minimum of four months.

Uh-oh, I thought.

The following Monday, I had to go to the Trillium Health Centre in Mississauga for a followup on my wrist that I’d managed to break in California last December (“How’s it feeling?” Fine. “You’re good to go.”) and the next day I had to meet my good friend Tim Miller of the Hamilton Spectator at a Denny’s in Oakville for breakfast.

That was the last time I ate out. By March 12, two days later, Canada had started to catch on. The prime minister went on television to tell people to “go home and stay home.” Friday, the country was hitting its stride with the health minister and the medical officer of health adding their voices and suddenly we were in lockdown.

So what do you do when you can’t go anywhere? How do you pass the time? I do a lot of writing for the Star and my own website, but there is still down time. I like to read and I have eclectic tastes: autobiographies of Brian Mulroney, Pierre Trudeau, John Turner, George W. Bush and Punch Imlach, for instance, and videos/DVDs on everything from the Second World War to the third season of Hill Street Blues.

But my primary focus is on all things automotive, with an emphasis on motorsport.

To start, there are DVDs: fact (“Indianapolis 500: the Sixties — a Decade of Change”) and fiction (“To Please A Lady,” starring Clark Gable and Barbara Stanwyck, about an Indianapolis driver who loses the big race on purpose to prove to his sweetheart that he’s learned there are more important things in life than winning).

There are several F1 documentaries (“Grand Prix: The Killer Years” is one; there are others) that you might watch once but are so grisly that once is enough. And then there is the acclaimed Netflix series “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” and it really is stupendous. But I’ll tell you this: if I hear the Hass F1 team principal, Guenther Steiner, use the F-word one more time, I am going to scream. He is equivalent to the CEO of a multibillion-dollar corporation and he should show more discipline. I was going to use the word “class,” but I’m afraid he’s incapable of that. Prediction: as long as he’s around, that team is going nowhere.

Anyway, while I watch the occasional DVD, I prefer to crack a book. Here are eight that I’ve been reading since my self-imposed exile began. I’ve read them all previously, of course, so these are rereads. But they are so good I am enjoying every word.

WHEELS, by Arthur Hailey. Hailey was a prolific Canadian novelist whose shtick was researching a subject to death and then writing a story around it. His three most famous books were Hotel, Airport and Wheels. I must admit that of the three, Hotel was the most shocking because Hailey had no problem unveiling some rather unsavoury practices that were commonplace (at the time) in an industry that just about all of us, at one time or another, have utilized.

For Wheels, he spent months at a Detroit auto factory (thought to be the Ford Motor Co.) and while the story is pedestrian, the “reporting” was wonderful. This all took place before automation and the industry has been turned upside down since, but it was hot stuff at the time. He wrote that the worst cars to buy were the ones manufactured on Mondays and Fridays (because of assembly line absenteeism), and for several years afterward, every dealer in North America swore the cars in their showrooms were all built on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Fun stuff.

MON AMI MATE (the friendship of 1950s British racers Mike Hawthorne and Peter Collins), by Chris Nixon. In some circles (I emphasize: some circles), Formula One Grand Prix drivers are seen as being more cultured and sophisticated than their American counterparts. Stirling Moss vis-à-vis A.J. Foyt, for example. Read this incredible book by Nixon, though, and you quickly come to the conclusion that regardless of nationality or social standing, boys will be boys.

Collins, who married a Broadway actress, once exploded with rage when he learned that a South American woman with whom he’d had a brief affair (a.k.a. one-night stand) was pregnant, suggesting she should have taken precautions. (The #MeToo movement would have loved this guy.) Hawthorne was world champion (think about that: world champion) when he was killed in a street race with Rob Walker, an F1 team owner and a one-time columnist for Road and Track magazine.

Boyhood chums, both drove for Ferrari and then died violently within five months of each other, Collins in a Grand Prix at the Nurburgring and Hawthorne on a four-lane highway in England. An impressive read.

BLACK NOON, by Art Garner. May 30, 1964, was one of the worst days in the history of the Indianapolis 500. A California sports car champion named Dave MacDonald, who was a rookie at Indy, was driving an experimental car entered by off-road racer Mickey Thompson, when he lost control during the second lap and the ensuing carnage killed him, veteran Eddie Sachs and injured three other drivers, Johnny Rutherford, Ronnie Duman and Bobby Unser. Everything — and I mean everything — you would want to know about that day and those men is in this book.

WINNERS ARE DRIVEN, by Bobby Unser. Talking about Unser and “boys-will-be-boys,” he was one of the great practical jokers of all time. To this day, Foyt starts giggling when recalling some of Unser’s stunts. Lloyd Ruby tells this story.

“Bobby loved playing with M80s (a firecracker with the oomph of about a fifth of a stick of dynamite). Once we were at a Boy Scout banquet and he put one in a giant bowl of salad. The salad went everywhere. One time we checked into a motel and he was dropping M80s in the toilets, which didn’t help the plumbing. Then he’d start playing with the fire extinguishers out in the hall. Needless to say, we didn’t get invited back.”

At some point, Unser matured and wrote a great book on how to succeed in business and in life by applying the principles and strategies he used on the speedway. Globe and Mail columnist Harvey Schachter gave it a positive review. It’s worth reading because at some point we’ll all be able to leave the house and there might have to be a reset. This book could help.

IACOCCA: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, by Lee Iacocca. Never mind the pandemic. The worst thing that has happened to business, government and publishing has been the “executive committee,” or “inner cabinet.” Why? Because everybody insists on having their say and, as a result, it takes forever to get anything done.

Iacocca, either through force of personality or physical intimidation (yes, that existed in his time and, to an extent, still does) got things done. Ford and Chrysler Corp., particularly the latter, owe much of their success to his skill, expertise and chutzpah. What he said, went. We could use more like him.

THE AMERICAN MOTEL and THE AMERICAN DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT, both by Michael Karl Witzel. If you like “The Road,” you will love both of these books. No, they are not about Holiday Inns and McDonald’s drive-ins (although, did you know the early McDonald’s had carhops?), but how tents, trailers, cabins and eventually motels changed the face of travel in America.

And when the car was king, who had time to go home for dinner when all you had to do was pull into a hot dog-or-hamburger-to-go joint for nourishment? A good number of these places are found along the old Mother Road, Route 66. While we’re in lockdown, both those books are a great way to go on vacation without leaving your living room.

EVEL, by Leigh Montville. A great read about the rags-to-riches-to-rags-again daredevil Evel Knievel, who, over the course of his career, really did break every bone in his body — at least once. I was at Snake River Canyon for the Star in 1974, when Evel went into the river instead of over/across it and will never forget going to the airport in Twin Falls, Idaho (only the late Christie Blatchford and I thought to go out there), where he boarded his Learjet to fly over the jump site and vowed to “dip his wings in salute” to the canyon that had beaten him.

Little-known fact: the last jump before Snake River was over 15 Mack trucks in front of the Grandstand at that year’s 1974 Canadian National Exhibition. Great stuff.",[],1501,0.9001566339051557

640 horsepower?

Colour me corrupted.

I just got out of the first 2021 Porsche 911 Turbo S in the country. It was a German-spec car brought over for press demos.

Danke schön, Porsche.

Base list is $231,700 for the Coupé, $246,300 for the Cabriolet.

My coupé tester totalled $241,540, bolstered by a few options that included Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM — it wouldn’t be a Porsche feature without a three- or four-character acronym), a $1,720 hit which lowers the car by 10 mm and brings faster-reacting dampers for improved handling with less compromise in ride comfort.

Together with Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (sure, PDCC), which changes the antisway bar stiffness to reduce body roll in cornering, they further reduce the ride/handling tradeoff that has plagued suspension designers forever.

If you have to choose things like adaptive cruise control ($2,280), lane change assist ($1,200) and lane-keep assist ($1,390) as in my tester, maybe you’re not really ready for a car like this.

You are supposed to drive this car; it shouldn’t be driving you.

Visually, the car is hardly a stealth-mobile. The wider fenders, the unique front and rear fascias, the deployable rear spoiler, and most notably the massive wheels and tires (Pirelli P ZERO, 255/35ZR20 front, 315/30ZR21 rear) with huge brakes (420 mm rotors with no fewer than 10-piston calipers up front, 390 mm four-pots at the rear, painted bright yellow) tell you this is a serious car.

Still, compared to the GT3 RS, it’s relatively unadorned. It illustrates the simple beauty of the 911 shape, which has been remarkably unchanged over its nearly six decades of history.

The excellent fit and finish, the minor controls, the comfy and supportive front seats, the rear seats designed for circus acrobats, the trunk up front like an elephant, and the fact that you cannot see the engine at all, are similar to other 911s.

I’ll focus here on what makes the Turbo S version so different, so special.

The 3.8 litre twin-turbo flat six engine pumps those 640 horses and 590 lb.-ft. of torque through an updated PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe) double-clutch gearbox.

Fire it up, and the familiar flat-six exhaust growl greets you.

Pull away, and the first thing to strike you — it’s quick. Bloody quick.

Throttle response is RIGHT NOW.

I attempted some 0-100 km/h runs on a deserted stretch of dead-end road using the car’s built-in timer.

But I was so busy holding on, I couldn’t work the buttons fast enough.

These sprints looked drama-free from outside, because thanks to the various control systems there’s no wheel spin, just the bellow of the car as it disappears over the horizon.

Trust me: the factory-supplied time of 2.7 seconds is no lie.

Of course, at 100 km/h the car is just catching its breath, on its way to a theoretical top end of 330 km/h.

This makes the Turbo S one of the very fastest cars you can legally operate on Canadian roads.

OK, the “330 km/h” part is not so legal ...

What is most impressive is the continual improvement Porsche has made in reducing turbo lag. In this car there’s a continuous surge of power to the red line, upshift, and do it again.

As always, that PDK shifts seamlessly and immediately.

Sure, you can play with the shift paddles, but you won’t be able to beat the machine.

The shift lever is the same as in other new-generation 911s — forward for Reverse, back for Drive, push a button for Park. In other words, they should throw it out and go back to PRNDL — Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Low. That design ain’t broke; stop trying to fix it.

The steering is as precise as you’d expect from a Porsche, and offers what seems to be perfect weight.

The full-time four-wheel drive system is rear-axle biased, but can deliver up to 62 per cent of the torque to the front wheels if it deems it necessary to do so.

The torque vectoring system directs drive force to whichever wheel or wheels can best use it. Along with the electronically controlled limited slip rear differential, it will do its level best to keep you from becoming part of the scenery.

You have a choice of five drive modes via a round knob at the 5 o’clock position on the steering wheel, each of which tailors things like throttle response and transmission reaction to suit.

“Normal” is — you guessed it — for normal driving conditions.

“Sport” and “Sport Plus” up the performance ante in successive, predictable steps.

“Individual” allows you to choose various settings to your own taste. For example, I set everything to be as “sporty” as possible, but backed the suspension off to “Normal” to reduce harshness.

“Wet” actually measures how damp the road is via sensors in the front wheel wells, and adjusts the settings accordingly. I have tested this on other 911s, and it really works.

In “Sport” or “Sport Plus” modes, the PDK will let the engine rev until it hits the red line, but will not automatically upshift. It just chatters away on the red line. You after all are in the driver’s seat.

As you slow down, the PDK will stay in whichever gear you’ve selected until the revs drop too low, in which case it downshifts for you.

But as you re-accelerate to the max, it will again stay on that red line until you hit that right-side paddle.

The uprated suspension in the Turbo S does the business. Ride quality was actually not as harsh as I feared, although those ultralow aspect ratio tires set up a bit of bump-thump on sharp road irregularities, of which there is no shortage here in early spring.

A separate button on the dash allows you to firm up the dampers for even more control. It did make the suspension react more sharply, but frankly, it was difficult to evaluate their handling benefit under these less-than-perfectly-controlled test conditions.

Say, Porsche — when you and Mosport are ready, so am I ...

Porsches, especially the more powerful 911s, have a somewhat sinister reputation for tricky on-the-limit handling, what with all that engine weight hanging out aft of the rear axle.

That is pretty much a thing of the past.

Sure, if you shut off all the nanny systems and really ham-fist it, it might get a bit tail-happy.

But as hard as I dared drive this car on public roads, it remained resolutely stable.

Wish your way around that corner; it follows your bidding.

The car is equally adept at just cruising around, comfortable and tractable. Not the least bit fussy.

The satellite radio was not functioning in my car, and apparently there is no AM radio in Germany because all I could get was FM. Still, the Bose sound system was its usual excellent self.

Every advance in the 911’s development has expanded its bandwidth, with more performance at the sharp end, and more comfort at the other.

The Turbo S continues this tradition.

Unlike a lot of exotics, the Turbo S is a car you could live with, day to day, season to season.

Now, you have no doubt heard the old real estate adage that buying the cheapest house in a good neighbourhood is the best investment.

You can get a 911 that looks almost the same as the Turbo S for less than half its price.

But if you want the ultimate 911, you’ll just have to pony up.

One test drive and you will be making another call to your bank manager.

In Ecclestone’s mind, the CASC — an arm of the international motoring authority FIA — had botched negotiations with the country’s top two brewers, Labatt and Molson, over rights to sponsor the F1 Grand Prix of Canada, which — among other things — had resulted in the cancellation of the race in 1987.

Ecclestone had the ear of Jean-Marie Balestre, president of the FIA at the time, mainly because of the clout he carried as president of the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA). Without FOCA, there would be no Formula One.

He convinced Balestre (which wasn’t hard) that the amateur CASC had to go, to be replaced by a professional National Sporting Authority (ASN). Shortly after, the CASC was expelled from the FIA. Ecclestone then had Balestre put his pal, Benoit Mailloux, who was president of the FAQ (Federation de l’Automobile Quebec), in charge of all Canadian motorsport.

This did not go over well in many quarters, with critics suggesting the move was only good for the Grand Prix and not much else. In fact, rally drivers and teams were sufficiently concerned that they broke away to create the Canadian Association of Rallysport that would govern rallying.

In 1990, a company incorporated as ASN Canada FIA, took over from Mailloux, who was only too happy to hand over the keys to Roger Peart, president, and vice-president Paul B. Cooke. Peart and Cooke, through their ASN, then sanctioned road course and street racing for 30 years.

Late last year, they resigned from the FIA, a move that was unexpected. Yes, Peart was in his 80s and in ill health but Cooke, also in his 80s, had assumed the presidency and had not even hinted that he was going to throw in the towel. There was no succession plan either, so the resignation, which became official Dec. 31, left a void and a number of constituencies — 10, in total — rushed to fill it.

Several weeks ago, Jean Todt, president of the FIA, announced that Francois Dumontier, president and promoter of the Grand Prix du Canada and Ron Fellows, retired racer and co-owner of what is now known as Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, operating as GDS (Groupe de Development Sportif), would head up the new ASN. This week, Fellows announced that the retired CEO of Canadian Tire, Stephen Wetmore, had agreed to be part of the executive team.

As was the case in the late 1980s and 1990, and which explains the previous eight paragraphs of background, this has not gone over well with many in the racing community, with some suggesting that, in the end, only the Grand Prix and perhaps CTMP will benefit.

As they say, its déjà vu all over again.

As was the case that led to the creation of CARS in 1990, the five racing regions in the country are currently split over these developments, with the presidents of two regions going so far as to write the FIA suggesting it not pay any attention to an application put forward by someone from a third region. Which is exactly the sort of behaviour that had Ecclestone rolling his eyes in the first place.

You’d think people would have learned.

The difficulty with volunteers, whether it’s a service club or a fundraising campaign or people administering motorsport in Canada, is that, often, competing agendas are at work and more than one person wants to be the boss. Professional organizations operate differently. You are on the team, or not. There are few grey areas.

At last count, there are nearly 250 ASNs in the world. Jean Todt, president of the FIA, has lots on the go at the moment, starting with the pandemic that has brought the world to its knees and including 70th anniversary celebrations of F1. I suggest he does not have a lot of time to worry about who is going to run racing in Canada and even after accepting recommendations from his vice-presidents and other advisers, he went with the guys he knew, which is pretty much how the real world works.

But in so doing, Todt went against the FIA’s Code of Conduct, which can be interpreted as saying that promoters can’t be part of ASNs. This is particularly bothersome to two of the people I talked to before sitting down to write this situational. They are Dr. Hugh Scully, chairman of the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame and a pioneer in motorsports medicine, and Michael Kaerne, national steward for the Grand Prix and a past president of the Canadian Association of Car Clubs (CACC), which governs motorsports in British Columbia.

Said Kaerne: “If you look at the FIA statutes, the ethics and the Code of Conduct statues, under 2.2, it specifically says that promoters may not be part of an ASN. They’ve gone against their own statutes. That in itself should be a red flag.”

Scully was not as forthcoming in his criticism but agreed there was a problem.

But according to vice-president Fellows, that shouldn’t be a concern because the regions will continue to run amateur racing as they always have while the commercial side will concentrate on attracting money — “Right now, there is no money. None” — in order to create a structure to build a ladder system for young Canadian racers to advance in the sport beyond karting.

So far as money is concerned, the previous ASN had no such problems when it set up shop in 1990.

“It was the best of times for racing in this country,” Fellows said. “You had three major homegrown series sponsoring three different categories of racing and one of the sponsors of one of those series (Imperial Tobacco) was also building a driver development program. There was plenty of money flowing and it was a much easier time for revenue for the sanctioning body.

“The issue with the new sanctioning body is that we’re at a low point and our ability to attract some commercial interest is part of the plan. That’s the way we can grow this. Having the sporting authority supported by licensing and a couple of sanctioning deals is not financially viable. There aren’t enough people in this country with racing licences to support that.”

For his part, Dumontier said it became apparent a year or two ago that the previous ASN would not be able to carry on much longer and so he contacted Fellows.

“It was clear that we were the two biggest in the sport and it was natural for us to be involved,” he said. “At some point we decided to put in our own application. I met Jean (Todt) at our event in Montreal in June (the Grand Prix) and then again in January in Paris. The FIA World Motorsport Council met in April and our application for a new ASN was accepted.”

Dumontier said, like Fellows, that they plan to let the regions administer amateur motorsports in their jurisdictions while the new ASN will concentrate on the commercial side. This, in turn, will let them work with the regions, “to go back to the grassroots.”

“As you know,” he said, “since we lost Player’s (Imperial Tobacco), it was never replaced so we have to try to create a ladder series to bring the young kids to perform on the larger stage. We are lucky enough to have two Canadian drivers in the F1 championship (Lance Stroll and Nicholas Latifi) and we know why that is (family money), so we have to create something for the young people who don’t have that level of support. It’s part of the vision that Ron and I have to grow the sport.”

To that end, Dumontier said he, Fellows and others on the executive board want to promote more international events in the country.

“There is nothing specific at the moment, but in my discussions with Jean Todt, Canada is seen as a country with a great racing tradition. The Grand Prix has been here for more than 50 years and Jean would like to see more international events in the country. I’m on the same page. We are going to work with the FIA to see what we can bring and where.”

Dumontier said that right from the beginning, “we said in our application to start an ASN that the regions have to be involved and we wanted to work with the regions. They had an application of their own (to start an ASN) but they had disagreements, primarily from one guy, from the western side of the country.”

That, of course, would be Michael Kaerne, who freely admits to being “a s- disturber. I had to ask the hard questions (of the previous ASN) because somebody had to do that.”

Kaerne, a former driver, mechanic, president of CACC and national steward for the Grand Prix, acknowledges that he undoubtedly browned off some of his counterparts across the country when he unilaterally incorporated a not-for-profit federal corporation, Motorsport Canada ASN, in order to apply for a new Canadian ASN.

But he is well connected with senior FIA officials and suggests the process — despite that letter of objection sent to the FIA by the leaders of two of the five regions — eventually came down to three applications: his, one from the U.K. (Gary O’Hare, who operates a racing school in the U.K and Quebec) and the Dumontier-Fellows bid. The one from the U.K. was subsequently rejected and Kaerne says that the World Motorsport Council “wanted Francois and I to try to work together.”

“So I got hold of Francois and he said that he’d have to talk to Ron and that he’d get back to me but he never did. So I tailored my proposal to include Francois as representative of all the motorsport promoters in Canada and sent that in. It turned out that Francois’ proposal was the only one put up for a vote.”

Kaerne thinks he knows what happened.

“Francois had been agitating for a new ASN for at least two years,” he said. “At Montreal last year, he made a deal with Jean Todt, who’s a friend of his, and so things kind of went from there.”

But there is a bad taste in some mouths.

“I don’t think WCMA (Manitoba and the Prairies), CACC (British Columbia) and, the last time I talked to them, Ontario (CASC-OR) are planning to join Francois’ ASN. ASQ (Quebec) will, because there is a connection there; we don’t know about ARMS (Atlantic Region Motor Sports, which was asked to comment for this story but declined after initially saying it would).

In the end, Kaerne doesn’t think amateur racing needs the new ASN.

“The thing about the regions,” he said, “is that we only need the FIA for international licenses, or to put on listed events (international races) and because we’re not the promoters of listed events, it’s not a real requirement. We have the same insurance policy as we got through (the previous) ASN Canada and we’ve done that individually.

“We haven’t heard anything from Francois in regards to his plans. He’s said previously that he would have a representative of the regions on his board but nothing’s been brought forward. The regions could keep things going; whether it would be as healthy or healthier is another question,” adding that despite the difficulties, there are advantages to being affiliated with the governing ASN, such as a financial payment for including FIA rules in regional regulations.

So there you have it. There’s more — much more — but I’m sure you get the picture. Scully, the doctor who got into motorsport in the 1960s when he went to Mosport Park for a race and was appalled at the lack of medical facilities (“There were none”) and subsequently founded the Ontario Race Physicians organization that, to this day, staffs motorsport events, said in an interview that he stands ready to chair a meeting in an effort to solve the impasse.

“I’ve been around Canadian racing a long time,” said the chairman of the Hall of Fame, “and served on medical commissions at the international level, and I can converse in both official languages. I have the skills to bring people together to reach a consensus (he’s a former president of the Ontario and Canadian Medical Associations) and I’m ready to answer an invitation to do that if one should be forthcoming.”

My take: Despite the hurt feelings, and the evidence of politics at play (as in, the fix might have been in), Francois Dumontier and Ron Fellows are the people who should run motorsport in Canada. The world has changed (no, I’m not talking about the pandemic) and a professional ASN is preferable to one composed of amateurs.

In order for motorsport in Canada to grow, not just in Ontario and Quebec but everywhere, a ladder system of both open and closed-wheel racing must be established and for that to happen you need money. Dumontier and Fellows, with the help of new member Wetmore, have a better chance of getting into boardrooms to pitch for it than just about anybody else involved in Canadian racing, Once upon a time the tobacco companies poured millions into the sport but that’s gone and has never been replaced. If anybody can raise it, these men can.

The proof will be in the pudding, of course. Everybody will be watching.

The reopening of dealerships is welcome news to employees and customers across the province.

At the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trillium Automobile Dealers Association (TADA) introduced sweeping health and safety guidelines aimed at protecting service staff and customers.

The TADA released a comprehensive set of guidelines for the safe reopening of sales and other areas within a dealership. These guidelines were created in consultation with the Ontario Motor Vehicle Industry Council, the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association and other provincial auto associations.

Each dealership will follow strict health and safety protocols for each department.

For sales departments, the following guidelines have been issued to all registered new-car dealerships in Ontario to ensure maximum safety for dealership employees and customers (these are highlights of the guidelines only):

All vehicle surfaces touched by the customer during a demo or test drive, including keys, door handles, steering wheel, gearshift, touchscreen, accessories and trunk handle, will be disinfected. When cleaning is complete, the vehicle will be locked and recorded as disinfected.

A stringent appointment system to control customer flow will be implemented.

Each dealership will install signage indicating where customers are to proceed upon arrival.

When confirming appointments by phone, customers will be advised to not visit the dealership if they are exhibiting any symptoms associated with COVID-19. Upon arrival at the dealership, customers will also be advised of the safety measures in place to protect them, as well as staff. These may include restricted access to the showroom floor, the presence of hand-sanitizer stations, limited washroom access, etc.

Dealership staff at reception will be safely distanced from customers and have access to appropriate personal protective equipment.

Customers will be directed to sanitize their hands upon arrival, prior to meeting with any dealership staff.

A staff member will unlock a vehicle and keep the key on their person at all times.

Digital records will be kept of each vehicle presented to customers, including name, contact information, date, duration of entry and staff-member name.

All vehicles will be locked after each presentation and the key to the staff member responsible for cleaning and disinfecting keys.

All vehicle surfaces touched by the customer during the presentation will be disinfected, including keys, door handles, steering wheel, gearshift, touchscreen, seatbelt buckles, accessories and trunk handle.

Any employee(s) carrying out the evaluation of vehicles for potential trade will wear protective gloves throughout the process and observe proper handwashing protocols immediately upon completion of the evaluation.

For test drives, a series of protocols have been suggested for all salespeople which include, among other things, washing his/her hands prior to departing, advising the customer to do the same, taking a photo of the customer’s driver’s licence without touching the physical licence and choosing a disinfected vehicle OR ensuring the customer’s selected vehicle is properly disinfected prior to departing. Dealers will be following provincial social-distancing guidelines while they remain in place

Delivery of purchased vehicles will be done at the physical dealership, preferably in an outdoor location designated for this specific purpose. Dealership staff will ensure full sanitization of the vehicle interior, including steering wheel, gearshift, touchscreen, seatbelt buckles, accessories, as well as all door and trunk handles, prior to providing the customer with the keys. Keys will also be fully disinfected before presentation.

Dealership staff will maintain the recommended two-metre distance from the customer during the delivery process and must not enter the vehicle with the customer. A full demonstration of the vehicle’s features can be provided virtually, i.e. through online video, FaceTime, etc.

In fact, we used to publish a popular feature here in Wheels called Eye Candy, in which people who’d either purchased an already-restored car or taken a few years to polish up a clunker got to show them off in the paper.

The ones who bought their restored automobiles might have received accolades, but they missed out on a lot: the challenge, the frustration, the expense and the time required to take on a restoration project. Most important, they also missed out on the fun of acquiring something that had seen better days and that they’d brought back to life and made sparkle.

The ones who opted to do the restorations themselves often admit to working in their spare time for five or 10 years to do a car. I want to introduce you today to a neighbour of mine in Mississauga who’s taken — wait for it — 35 years to return a 1968 Plymouth Barracuda fastback to its former, brand-new glory.

That’s three and a half decades.

His name is Todd Murray, he's 53 and the car he’s nuts about, and has devoted so much of his life to, is a two-door passenger car that was based initially on the 1959 Plymouth Valiant compact car but had evolved to boast Barracuda-specific sheet-metal styling and have its own range of models, including convertibles.

Murray bought his baby the year he turned 18 — 1985 — and finally finished it, literally, the other day. It’s licensed and insured and rarin’ to go. He planned to spend the summer this year going on cruises and to car shows in towns all over Ontario, but the coronavirus crisis has more or less put a damper on that.

But taking 35 years to do what he’s done shows he’s a man of patience, so the cruises and car shows can wait. A pretty laid-back guy, he’s OK with that.

Murray is single, has a 10-year-old daughter and works as a heating, air-conditioning and ventilation mechanic. He lives up the street from me in a two-storey, three-bedroom house with a one-car garage where he’s done much of the work on this car.

Read that again. He’s done much of the work on that car in a one-car garage. The ’Cuda is about six feet wide and the garage is nine feet, giving him about 18 inches on either side of his pride and joy to do much of the restoration work.

(Actually, it just hit me that maybe the reason it took him 35 years to do this is because he didn’t have a lot of room to manoeuvre inside that garage.)

Murray and two pals from his Oakville high school days, Paul Bouchard and Blake Dryden, are crazy about Barracudas and have all worked on each other’s cars at one time or another.

“In our spare time, we’ve gone to car shows over the years,” Murray said. “Pretty much every night of the week, there’s a car show you can go to. It’s a good night out.”

He said he doesn’t belong to a car club: “The three of us are kind of our own little club.”

Bouchard, who was visiting his friend the day I’d wandered over, owns a 1970 ’Cuda that’s blue, but if painted canary yellow would have fit right into the 1996-2001 TV series “Nash Bridges.”

“I remember the first episode I saw of that show,” Bouchard joked. “A woman committed suicide by jumping out of a highrise window and she landed right on the hood of the ’Cuda. I said, ‘Oh, no!’”

Murray said he inherited his love for cars from his father, the late Keith Murray. “My father was always a Mopar guy, and he had a bunch of old cars as I was growing up and he kind of piqued my interest,” he said. “I would always help him out, fixing his cars. He would do most of the timing and oil changes and everything right in our driveway, so I kinda got into it through him.”

Todd Murray said he actually owned two 1968 Barracudas before buying the one that’s in his garage now, but neither of the early cars was a keeper.

“I took parts off them to use on this one,” he said. “I stripped (the cars) down and saved all the parts and then Paul and Blake helped me when I started this project, which has really been an ongoing hobby.

“I bought this car in the spring when I was 18, and I’ve been working on it ever since. When we started, I was so meticulous that in order to do it right, the guys and I decided on what’s called a rotisserie restoration.”

(Which is when the car is totally disassembled. The frame is then placed on a car rotisserie so it can be turned and every nook and cranny on the car can be examined.)

“The whole car was stripped right down,” Murray said. “Every nut and bolt was taken out and either replaced or machined to be as good as new. We sandblasted the frame because the underside was in really bad shape. I had full quarter panels put on it.

“The fenders came from Portland, Ore. I have a friend who lives in Vancouver and he was into Barracudas, too, and he found me a set of fenders out there that were in, like, mint condition, original paint, so he bought them and shipped them to me. I went over to the train station and picked them up.”

Parts, as well as coming from his two previous ’Cudas and Oregon, were sourced at a huge midsummer car show held each year in Carlisle, Pa.

“That car show can take you three full days to go through,” he said. “We usually left Wednesday night or Thursday morning and the car show would start Friday morning and go to Sunday night, so we would camp out at the show. We would rough it — we slept in tents — but we had a lot of fun. We had to do a lot of searching for what we needed and then we’d bargain, which was always fun. We found tons of stuff for my car as well as Paul’s and Blake’s cars.”

He also bought a road sign, “Barracuda Blvd.,” that hangs in his garage. But back to the restoration.

“I did most of the mechanical work,” he said. “All of the chrome, which is brand new, and the reassembling was done in the garage, but I had a guy who did all the metal work for me — Paul’s car, too — and his name is Keith Sims, who’s probably one of the best metal guys around.

“Then I had to get the body done after that, to straighten it all back out, and painted (lime green), inside and out, and then I had to piece it all back together.”

This is where working in the small garage got tricky.

“There’s not a lot of room to move around in there,” he said. “It was a very tight fit, especially when I was trying not to scratch a new paint job. That’s why I wear track pants when I’m working around the car. No metal, like on jeans. Putting all the chrome back on it was definitely time-consuming. It’s been a labour of love, that’s for sure.”

I told him that I’d seen him zipping around a corner in our neighbourhood a few weeks ago and was wondering whether he was just out taking a quick spin and hoping not to run into the police. Turns out, as mentioned, the car is finished, licensed and insured, and this was to be the first summer he would drive it.

“There are still a couple of bugs to get out of it,” he said. “Steering-wise, it pulls a little to the right, so I have a guy that’s going to align the whole front end. All the parts up front are brand new, including the hub caps, which I will put on after the alignment, so it’s just a matter of setting it up properly. Other than that, it drives and rides real good.”

Murray said he’s restored the car to 1968 “factory spec,” so that means the seatbelts are just that: lap belts. There is no three-point harness in it like there is in 2020-model vehicles.

Murray doesn’t think that, after 35 years of tender, loving care, he would ever sell his ’Cuda. But would he restore another one?

“It would be pretty tough to do, money-wise,” he said. “I have between $65,000 and $70,000 invested in this one and that doesn’t count all of my labour. It’s an expensive hobby. Parts are expensive nowadays, too. You can probably buy just about anything for this car, unlike the scrounging around I had to do, but you would have to pay top price.

“Having said that, I think I’d like to buy one for my daughter Alyssa. I could fix it up for her; I have a lot of spare parts. I’m actually going to pick her up later today and take her for her first ride in it. She’s watched me work on it, so it will be a thrill for both of us.”

OK, the question I really wanted to ask was how fast this car could go. Murray sensed this and answered before I could ask it.

“This car has a 340-cubic-inch (5.6 L) small-block V-8 in it,” he said. “It has a four-barrel carburetor and it’s pretty quick. Lots of get up and go. Depending on the gear ratio you would run in the back, this one, factory, probably would do the quarter in around 14 seconds, That’s pretty good for a stock 340 car.

“When I first bought this car, it was painted white, and I took it to Cayuga (now Toronto Motorsports Park) a few times. I ran it down the strip. We went to the drag races there when we were younger. We had a lot of fun.”

Before I go, one other thing about this guy. Everything about this car is immaculate — just like his lawn and his flower beds. “Yes,” he said, “I really enjoy gardening. Maybe not as much as I do working on my car, but it’s close.”",[],1729,0.8767598055909787

Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S 4MATIC+. Four-door four/five-passenger super-sports sedan. Full-time four-wheel drive.

Price: Base — $177,500 (2020: $182,600). As tested $189,500.

Engine: 3982 cc V-8, dual overhead camshafts, four valves per cylinder, variable valve timing, twin turbochargers.

Power/torque, horsepower / lb.-ft.: 630 @ 5,500 — 6,600 r.p.m. / 664 lb.-ft. @ 2,500 — 4,500 r.p.m.

Transport Canada fuel consumption, City/Highway, litres/100 km: 15.6 / 11.5. Premium fuel.

Competition: Audi RS7; BMW M Gran Coupé, Porsche Panamera Turbo S.

What’s best: Fabulous looks; fabulous performance; room for more than one friend.

What’s worst: That stupid shift lever, obviously; a couple of missteps in trim bits, inside and out; ride on the harsh side.

What’s interesting: Mercedes leaves no “model stone’’ unturned.

First thing you have to know about the Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S 4MATIC+ sedan is it bears little structural relationship to the Mercedes-AMG GT Coupé we tested a while back.

Gosh; you don’t think the similarity in the names is a deliberate attempt to fool the customer, do you?

Or the inattentive journalist?

Naw...

Second thing you have to know is this is a brilliant car, which in my view successfully bridges the gap between the all-out performance of its GT Coupé cousin and the E-Class family cars with which it shares some bones.

Third thing: I call this vehicle a sedan for one simple reason — it is a sedan.

What else would you call a car with four doors and four (optionally, five) seats?

Like other German manufacturers, Mercedes thinks that just because it has a sloping roofline and frameless side windows, although it does have a middle roof pillar, they can call this a coupé.

Not in my column. I write in English.

Labels be damned, this is a true AMG product, built at AMG’s facility in Affalterbach, and this body style is not available as a “normal” Mercedes.

My tester was actually a 2019 model, whose base list price was $177,500, and it topped out at $189,500. The 2020 model with a few extra bits of equipment starts at $182,600.

Chances are, your dealer won’t have many (any?) in stock. But you’d probably want to spec yours out anyway — the option list is endless.

The engine is the hottest locally available version of the corporate 4.0-litre twin-turbo V-8, producing 630 horsepower between 5,500 and 6,600 r.p.m., and 664 lb.-ft. of torque between 2,500 and 4,500 r.p.m. The signature of the sole engine assembler is on a plaque on the engine itself.

Interesting to note, this is actually more power than its allegedly more sporting cousin the AMG GT. Tobias Moers, head of AMG, told me at that car’s launch its dual-clutch transmission had a torque limitation the more powerful engine would exceed.

The GT S therefore uses Mercedes’ nine-speed automatic with the multi-plate clutch pack eliminating the sloppy starts that even the best torque-converter automatics can occasionally deliver, mounted up front behind the engine.

Suspension is the “AIRMATIC’’ system, with multi-chamber air springs and AMG’s adaptive dampers.

The “4MATIC+” part of the name means Mercedes’ full-time four-wheel-drive system, which automatically directs torque to whichever wheel can best use it.

The car is gorgeous, from the aggressive grille, slim LED headlights and subtle power bulges on the hood; through the smooth flanks with a subtle character line running the length of the car; to the slim tail lights and massive quad tailpipes and rear diffuser in the tail.

One harsh false note: the “vents” above the car’s nameplates on the sides just ahead of the front doors are fake. Shame.

At least the vents behind the rear wheels are real to allow air under the wheel arches to escape.

I was not initially a fan of matte paint finishes. The paint industry spent a century figuring out how to make cars shiny; now for an extra few grand you can make it look like someone painted it with a broom.

I’m starting to come around, because the “Designo Brilliant Blue Magno” looks terrific on this car. Another $2,500 from your piggy bank.

The interior is equally gorgeous, with real tree-wood (open-pore grey ash; $500), saddle-brown/black Nappa leather upholstery ($1,800) and top-quality materials everywhere, with the exception of the cover of the centre console in the rear seat, which is a cheap-looking bit of plastic. An odd oversight.

There are all sorts of features you will be discovering months after you take delivery.

Such as an interior colour lighting scheme that lets you choose the shade to suit your mood or taste.

And, the dash vents glow red or blue depending on whether warm or cool air is flowing through them.

The seats strike an excellent balance between the comfort required of a Grand Touring car and the lateral support needed for a car that handles this well.

The rear seat (two buckets or the optional three-seat bench) is actually habitable, provided occupants aren’t much taller than six feet. Your view of the outside world will be limited, however; the massive front-seat headrests take up most of the forward aspect, and the rear side windows are small triangles through which you must peek.

The dash and minor controls are a mix of the latest in Mercedes’ interior technology, with a couple of touches from the older-parts bin.

The twin screens on the dash provide a wide range of layouts depending on the selected driving mode. They are bright and readable, although it will take some time to know where every tidbit of information is located.

One of the “throwback” bits is the round knob on the centre console allowing selection of various functions. In some newer Mercedes models, this has been replaced with a touch pad hard enough to figure out when you’re standing still; when you are taking advantage of this car’s prodigious performance, it would be impossible, bordering on hazardous.

Some carmakers, with Mazda taking the lead, are starting to agree with me about this “just-touch-this” concept for the simple reason it is wrong.

Maybe when cars are driving themselves, you’ll have time to figure these things out. But then, why buy a car this much fun to drive yourself?

No Mercedes road test would be complete without my usual beef about the shift knob. Despite the German penchant for intelligence and logic, they continue to have Park selected by pushing a button instead of just shoving the shift lever full-forward.

Not only does this contravene 70-odd years of accepted practice for zero additional functionality, but it might be dangerous because it’s hard to get your finger on the button hidden under the shift knob itself.

Sorry; it’s just stupid.

That said, driving is what this car is all about, and it delivers.

Slam-you-back-into-the-seat levels of acceleration are a mere stab of the loud pedal away. Zero-100 km/h takes a tick over three seconds, at which point the car is barely clearing its throat.

A seamless upshift, and off you go to the red line again.

This auto-box is one of the most clever in the business, seemingly predicting what gear you’re going to need and selecting it for you. If you think you can do a better job (hint: you can’t), you can play with the steering column paddles, or that damnable shift knob.

Throttle response is about as quick as turbocharged engines get, a benefit of those turbos being nestled between the cylinder banks, close to the intake manifolds.

Even when you’re going about 70 or 80 km/h and hammer on the gas on a dry road, you can still get the traction control light to flash.

Fuel crisis? What fuel crisis? Gas is currently 80 cents a litre at my local self-serve...

Handling is outstanding, belying the car’s massive 2,000-kg-plus weight.

The steering is precise and perfectly weighted.

This car has Mercedes’ four-wheel steering — in-phase at higher speeds for more stability, counter-phase at low speeds for more agility. The fact that you absolutely cannot feel it working shows how well worked out it is.

As I mentioned in my review of the AMG GT coupé, Mercedes’ test drivers had the ability to shut this feature off (again, you can’t) and the car handled much better with it activated.

The optional Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires — same as on my Targa Newfoundland Nissan Juke although these are much bigger — provide astonishing levels of grip. From my personal Targa experience with this tire, they don’t abandon you if it starts to rain.

Several drive mode settings are available via a rotary knob on the steering wheel at about the four-o’clock position. Throttle response, transmission shift speed, ride height, suspension firmness, even the exhaust note, are all altered in fairly predictable ways for the “Comfort,” “Sport” and “Sport+” modes.

“Drift” mode lets you play full-on hooligan if you have an unlimited tire budget.

“Race” mode converts it into a rear-drive car. AMG suggests you limit this setting to track use.

Killjoys; it was not so long ago AMG didn’t build any four-wheel-drive cars because they were deemed insufficiently sporty to bear this hallowed nameplate.

You can also program and store your own preferred settings.

Even with the suspension set to Comfort, ride quality is definitely on the firm side. It’s a small price to pay for the grip.

So, is the Mercedes AMG GT S 4MATIC+ a luxury car? Is it a very fast GT car? Is it a thinly disguised race car?

I’d say yes, yes and yes.

Its closest competitor would be the Porsche Panamera Turbo. One advantage the Porsche offers is the station wagon (Sport Turismo) body style, which is even more capacious than the AMG’s.

But the AMG GT S is more hard-edged, more of a pure driver’s car.

This customer is surely going to own more than one car.

If (s)he wants some serious driving fun and can find three friends to share it with, this would be the one to choose.",[],1622,0.7051588647546297

Canada (and the world) is now fighting a much different type of war, and Canadian businesses have stepped up to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) and necessary supplies for health-care professionals and other front-line workers.

Major auto manufacturers, in particular, are among the many industries that have made significant contributions to the fight against COVID-19. Auto manufacturers have leveraged their assembly plants, supply chain networks and expertise to provide face shields, ventilators and other items.

Although major auto manufacturers in North American have shut down production of automobiles, it is inspiring to see how quickly Ford and other manufacturers have pivoted from making vehicles to making medical supplies and equipment, and how our industry has rallied together during this difficult time.

The Ford Motor Company (the brand I represent), with support of Unifor Local 200, is producing face shields at its Windsor, Ont., engine plant and making them available to Ford dealers across Canada. Dealers are distributing the face shields to hospitals in their communities.

My dealership will receive a shipment of 100 face shields on May 4, which we will donate to Kirkland and District Hospital. We have requested more of these protective devices for a later date, which we plan to distribute locally.

In the U.S., Ford engineers are using their ingenuity and expertise to convert F-150 seat fans to manufacture much-needed respirators and ventilators. The company has teamed up with GE Healthcare and 3M to increase production of medical equipment and supplies.

Ford has a proud history of giving back to people and communities in need across Canada, and I am enormously proud to be a part of this company. (Other automakers have proud histories of providing support for communities at home and abroad as well.)

In 2016, the Ford Motor Company of Canada and Canadian Ford dealers donated more than $500,000 to the Red Cross for relief and recovery efforts related to the wildfires that impacted Fort McMurray and surrounding areas.

Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada has donated approximately 1,000 N95 ventilator masks, gloves, protective eyewear and sanitary boot protectors to four local hospitals. The company has used its production system expertise to streamline the design of the masks.

Toyota Canada is also working with InkSmith, a Canadian 3D printing company that is manufacturing face shields for medical workers.

GM Canada is preparing parts of the Oshawa, Ont., plant to produce face masks based on the GM production model already working in Michigan. The company plans to manufacture approximately one million masks per month, at cost, for the Canadian government with an estimated 50 employees supporting two shifts of production.

Some automakers have introduced relief programs and special financing arrangements to help customers affected by COVID-19.

For instance, Hyundai is offering existing finance and lease customers payment deferral options, and new customers have the option of a six-month deferral program on all new vehicles financed at a Hyundai dealership.

For Mazda customers whose leases are coming due but who are not “in a position to replace their vehicle at this time,” the automaker is offering lease extensions. Nissan Canada Finance will work with customers to discuss payment arrangements or deferments.

Not really — but allow me to explain.

Early in 1993, I received a press release from two guys I knew from racing, Gary Magwood and Lee Abrahamson, announcing the creation of the CMHF. As well, the release announced that the first gala induction dinner would be held at the Four Seasons Yorkville and feature John Surtees as guest speaker. It also announced the first group of inductees, headed by the late Gilles Villeneuve.

Now, I have always been very sensitive when it comes to the subject of auto racing. I’ve always felt there was a bias against oval-track racing and oval-track racers. This feeling might be misguided, but I’ve always felt that way. So, although I wasn’t surprised when I saw the rest of the names on the list of first-year inductees, all of whom are legends, I was bummed out because, as I expected, there was nary an oval-track racer on the list.

Never one to back down from a fight, I fired off a fax to Magwood. “Congratulations on the Hall of Fame and your first group of inductees,” I wrote. “But there is racing in this country other than road racing,” I continued, “and I consider the omission of the late Billy Foster, the first Canadian to qualify to race in the Indianapolis 500, to be a mistake.”

Magwood was, and remains, a very intuitive person. Fifteen minutes later, he faxed me back. “His name was just added to the list,” he said. (Editor’s note: Foster, of course, was not the first Canadian; he was the sixth, as the CMHF has since discovered.)

I attended that first induction gala — I sat at a table in the back with Jean Gauthier, former owner of Shannonville Motorsport Park — and moments before grace, Magwood approached me. “We couldn’t find anyone from the Foster family to be here,” he said, “so you’ll have to represent him,” which I was happy to do.

I accepted the induction honour on behalf of Foster, his family and “all oval racing drivers in Canada.” As luck would have it, I was able to make contact with Foster’s son, Billy Foster Jr., who was a police officer in Victoria, and presented him with the Hall of Fame medallion when we were both at the 1995 Molson Indy Vancouver.

So that was induction No. 1.

Induction No. 2 came in 2013 when I was welcomed into the Hall as the first journalist to be inducted. I was in a class with Diana Carter, John Magill, Nigel Mansell, Scott Maxwell and Paul Tracy. Pretty good company, if I do say so myself.

The reason I am writing about this today is because nominations are now open for the next induction ceremony, which will be held in downtown Toronto at the Canadian International AutoShow next February. And this is where everybody reading this comes in.

People frequently come up to me and say, “How come so-and-so isn’t in the Hall of Fame?” And I reply, “Probably because he/she hasn’t been nominated.” Let me explain.

It is not the job of the Motorsport Hall of Fame, or any other hall of fame, for that matter, to cherry pick who will be inducted. These are not “old boys’ clubs,” or shouldn’t be. Inductees are selected from people nominated by the public. In a media release this week, the CMHF said this:

“The CMHF honours and recognizes the achievements of individuals and institutions who have made outstanding contributions to Canadian motorsport as drivers, owners, team members, motorsport builders and significant contributors, as well as those who have distinguished themselves in a new media category.

“‘I look forward to seeing the nominations for this year. I do not envy the selection committee, which always has difficult choices to make,’ said the chairman of the board of directors, Dr. Hugh Scully.

“‘I urge everyone involved in motorsport — from team owners to drivers to fans — to nominate anyone who you feel has made a major contribution to motorsport in Canada, whether behind the wheel, from the owner’s box, on a timing stand, turning a wrench or holding a microphone.’

“As a general rule, inductees must be retired from competition for at least three years or, if still active, involved in motorsport for at least 25 years. Information about the nomination process, including the form, and submission requirements are available at CMHF.ca.”

OK, let me emphasize what Scully is saying about nominating someone. Road and street racing, for instance, could not happen without marshals. I know marshals who have flagged at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, the Molson/Honda Indy, the Grand Prix du Canada, the Grand Prix du Monaco and so on. Several could qualify for induction, but somebody has to nominate them.

I know a fellow who owns a speedway, who races sprint cars internationally, has won championships, has been named World of Outlaws promoter of the year not once but twice and is not in the Hall of Fame. Somebody has got to nominate that guy.

Now, two words of caution:

1) You can’t just send in the form and say something like, “Ronnie’s a really great guy and should be in the Hall of Fame,” or “Jeff’s been racing for 40 years and while he hasn’t been very successful, he should be in the Hall because everybody knows him.” Nominators (this means you) have to do the work of listing the contributions and the racing record of the person being nominated. You have to make the case. This is a Hall of Fame (emphasis on the fame).

2) Don’t get discouraged. Just because the person you nominated doesn’t make the cut this year, doesn’t mean he/she won’t be selected next year. Just keep sending in their nomination form, with documentation, and sooner or later, if worthy, they will probably make it.

I mean, how many years did it take for Dougie Gilmour to finally be named to the Hockey Hall of Fame?

Please think about this, and if you know of someone who merits consideration, please nominate them.

Two members of the Hall of Fame, François Dumontier and Ron Fellows, are now the two most powerful men in Canadian motorsport. The FIA announced this week that Dumontier is now the president of the National Sporting Authority in Canada (ASN) and Fellows is vice-president. They replace Paul Cooke and Roger Peart, who have retired. Dumontier is the owner and promoter of the Grand Prix du Canada and Fellows is co-owner of Canadian Tire Motorsport Park. More about all this at a later date.

BMW Andretti Motorsport’s Maximilian Guenther won the race Saturday in “Hong Kong,” with Envision Virgin Racing’s Nick Cassidy second and Pascal Wehrlein of Mahindra Racing third.

Now, gaming technology, which lends itself to auto racing better than any other sport, allows everyone involved in Formula Electric — teams, manufacturers, sponsors, drivers and fans — to take part in the live online races while raising funds for UNICEF, which will help keep children around the world safe, healthy and attending school online during the coronavirus crisis.

And that technology has also allowed the electric racing series to introduce a Pro-Am element to this promotion. Each race will have two separate grids, one made up of professional race drivers from the Formula E Championship and the other one filled by some of the fastest gamers in the world.

The carrot on the stick for the gamer champion will be a drive on a race weekend in a real Formula E car, once racing gets going again.

To keep this series as even as possible, drivers and gamers are competing using rFactor 2 software. The pro drivers all got simulators provided by Playseat, steering wheels and pedals from Fanatec and the latest gaming PCs, monitors, headphones and other peripherals from Asus.

The usual race points system is in play, but additional points are being awarded for pole position and fastest lap. Double points will also be on offer at the final race on June 13.

Now leading the championship as the result of his win on Saturday, Guenther punched the air as he got the checkered flag. “It wasn’t an easy race,” the German driver said moments after the event. “Even though it’s not the real world, we’re all competitive and we want to be at the front.”

Joshua Rogers, an Australian who earned $43,000 (U.S.) in 2019 competing in six gaming tournaments, won the Challenge Grid race.

You can watch the Race at Home Challenge every Saturday morning at 10:30 a.m. EDT on FIAFormulaE.com. Play-by-play announcer Jack Nicholls is calling the action, Nicki Shields will be covering the pits and Dario Franchitti is doing colour and analysis.

Now, as luck would have it, I did an interview a week ago Thursday with Nissan drivers Sébastien Buemi and Oliver Rowland. Nissan is in the series to promote its Leaf electric car and its Nissan Intelligent Mobility, which is integrated technology designed to increase safety, comfort and control while driving.

And I say “as luck would have it” because I really didn’t know all that much about virtual racing, or this particular series, and those two drivers were only too happy to fill me in.

Buemi, of course, is a name most race fans would recognize. He is a former Formula One driver (Scuderia Toro Rosso — and he once did a commercial for the sponsoring energy drink Red Bull by driving his F1 car across a frozen lake in northern Quebec) who won the Formula E championship in 2015-16 (Formula Electric starts its season in the late fall and finishes in the spring) and holds most of the records in that series — poles, fastest laps and so on. He was driving when Nissan won its first race in the series, last year in New York. Rowland was rookie of the year last season.

One of the surprising things they both said was that it’s harder to drive a simulator than a real race car. For instance, Rowland said that he’s new to this and, “Instead of cues, like what you can feel and what you can see, all you’ve got is a screen. You have a feeling that you’re driving a very good lap and then you find that you’re not. Some of the more experienced guys (driving simulators) have a bit of a head start.”

Added Buemi: “You don’t get the same feedback; it’s not the same. Simulators have improved massively over the years, but they are still not the same as the real car.”

Buemi said he’s tried to make the best out of being quarantined. “I exercise in the mornings and afternoons, but I am enjoying spending time with my family, which I can’t do because I’m away a lot. My children are four and two, so it’s nice to be with them.”

Returning to the Race at Home Challenge, he said: “It’s not like real racing, but it’s better than nothing. Everybody is stuck at home, so clearly, you have something to watch and I’m very happy that Formula E has launched this.”

Rowland had one suggestion: “You practise all week and then qualifying is one lap, which is kind of nerve-wracking because you don’t want to make a mistake. Instead of practising for five days, I think it would be better if they didn’t give us the circuit until Saturday morning. Then we could practise for an hour and then qualify.”

Formula E donated 10,000 pounds sterling ($17,400 Canadian) to UNICEF and will do so at the conclusion of every race up to a total of 100,000 pounds ($174,000). Fans are encouraged to donate by clicking on the prompts at the official Formula E YouTube channel, Facebook page and Facebook Gaming site, Twitch channel and via @FIAFormulaE on Twitter.",[],1998,0.9230384636848863

From the “if life hands you lemons” file, if you are stuck at home, here’s something that will help you pass the time and also do your car some good:

Clean it properly.

“Even with ‘shelter-at-home’ orders and physical distancing, many people rely on their vehicle to go to work or run errands. You might be surprised at the number of places your car can harbour germs and bacteria,” says Andrew Harkness, director of after-sales for Nissan Canada.

And you thought theft, crashes, flat tires, rust and mechanical breakdowns were the only car-related things you had to worry about!

I would start with a thorough exterior cleaning, probably at a coin-op, hand-held spray-wash facility. I never trust those rotating-bristle-brush systems, although they claim they do not harm the finish. Your call.

Perhaps needless to say, when using anything that might have been touched by anyone else, like the “wands” at the car wash, put new rubber gloves on before you get out of your car.

On your way home, stop at a drugstore to get some isopropyl alcohol (70 per cent alcohol) if you don’t already have some . The Public Health Agency of Canada says it is effective against COVID-19 .

Start with a general cleanup of the interior using a soft cloth — better still, a microfibre cloth — dampened with soap and water.

Next, use another clean cloth dampened with that isopropyl alcohol to disinfect anything you would touch.

Door handles inside and out, trunk/hatch/liftgate handles, key or key fob, steering wheel, seatbelt buckles, starter button if your car is plagued with one (small editorial comment there), gearshift lever or buttons, HVAC controls, radio/sound-system controls, lights, wipers, turn signals, cruise-control lever or buttons, four-way-flasher switch, rear-view mirror (make sure to get the back and sides of it, too), side-view mirrors or the controls thereof, centre stack, glove box and centre-console lid, parking-brake lever or control ...

Geez, when you think of all the bits in your car that you touch.

And anything else I might have missed.

Take particular care with the seatbelts themselves. Harsh cleaners can degrade the fibres in the belt fabric and affect the belts’ strength.

Another caveat applies to the infotainment screen if your vehicle is so-equipped. It is obviously a commonly touched surface, but again, avoid harsh cleaners. Screen wipes like you might use for your computer screens or camera lenses, or again, a soft cloth with soap and water, would be better.

If your car’s system has voice commands, you might consider learning how to use them.

Harkness also warns against using bleach, hydrogen peroxide, benzene, paint thinners or abrasive cleaners, which can damage interior surfaces and fabrics.

Ammonia-based cleaners can also damage the anti-glare and anti-fingerprint coatings on infotainment system screens.

Also be careful with leather upholstery. Many leather or leather-like fabrics have a protective coating, which may be damaged by frequent cleaning with alcohol.

An alternative is, again, good old soap and water, followed by a leather conditioner.

Hey, didn’t I warn you about leather? Cloth upholstery is always better!

In addition to wearing gloves during all this, you should do it in a well-ventilated area, preferably outside.

“Using the right product and the right material will not only help you properly clean your vehicle, but also avoid damaging it,” Harkness says.

You should also make sure your car stays in top mechanical condition. Just like you, your car needs regular exercise. I’m even taking the 1977 AMC Hornet out for the occasional spin.

Ryan Fulkerson, director of new model engineering for Nissan North America, suggests keeping the battery charged, either by a short drive or with a trickle charger.

I would add to this suggestion that you make that “short” drive long enough for the car to get up to full working temperature. This will also make sure all the car’s fluids get to wherever they need to go, so keep those levels topped up.

And don’t just let it idle — that’s worse than letting it sit unused.

Fulkerson also notes that tires that aren’t driven on frequently can develop flat spots which can lead to premature and uneven wear.

You should also check your tire pressures weekly. You should do this virus or no virus, but I know most of you don’t. It’s particularly important in these times when you might not be driving your car as regularly.

We know this virus will eventually peter out. Performing these maintenance and cosmetic tasks will help ensure your car is ready to go when the world is once again ready for it.",[],784,0.8877335810371206

Like many people these days, predominantly white-collar people, he’s working at home.

And he’s not alone. That research and development tech centre employs roughly 1,200 people supporting the design and evolution of all Nissan and Infiniti vehicles produced in North America. To continue product development during this pandemic, 80 per cent of them are working, as they say, remotely.

Which is a subject near and dear to my heart and led to me asking questions.

I don’t know why, for instance, it took a pandemic to kick-start the movement to work from home. Yes, there are some people who will always have to go to “the office,” but many others can do what they do in a home office or in their dining room.

It can save them money on clothing, dry-cleaning (they can work in their jeans instead of a suit or dress), parking/transit expenses and lunch, and it would be great for the environment because less greenhouse gases would be produced by fewer cars on the roads.

If a company has to rent space, it could save money by cutting down on the amount needed. And rents could come down because landlords would want to fill that space.

I became aware of the potential back in 1994 when I was chair of the United Way campaign in Kingston and the Islands. We had a great year, a lot of fun, and we raised a lot of money. I’d go to, say, Novelis, or DuPont, or Goodyear over in Napanee, which were manufacturing facilities, and there’d be a good turnout and I’d do my shtick and the pledges would roll in.

But when I went to the OHIP building (the Ontario government of the day was big on decentralization), I received a shock. Not that many people had turned out for the kickoff breakfast.

“What’s going on?” I said to the person who was chair of the OHIP campaign. “Don’t worry,” she said. “We’ll reach our goal.” But I wanted to know more. “Where is everybody?” I asked. And this is what she said.

“Except for management, most of the employees are doing clerical work, processing claims. They can come to work here in the office, or they can work at home. About half like the discipline of the office, so they come here to work 8:30 till 4:30 and they are with us today.

“The other half are at home. As long as they maintain the average (of claims processed per hour), they can continue doing that. We work a 35-hour week. We have one woman who starts at midnight Sunday and she works straight through. Her ‘week’ is done at 11 o’clock Tuesday morning. I couldn’t do it, but it works for her.”

Remember, that was 1994. Things might have changed. But I thought that was terrific. It could work in any office setting, I thought. So I was delighted to hear Flotkoetter say that it’s working for the Nissan tech centre — he gave examples, which I’ll get to in a second — and might lead to a sea change as far as how workplaces in general are defined going forward.

Meantime, Nissan — like other automakers — is in business to build and sell cars and trucks and is not sitting idle.

“It’s the same mission for Nissan,” Flotkoetter said. “It’s just a different approach. We’re trying to push forward with product development and we’re trying to focus on the new models we’ll have coming out in the future. In order to do that, we all can’t just stop because we’re unable to be in the same place.”

Because of the COVID-19 crisis, Flotkoetter said, the company decided to shut down its operations and start to work remotely on March 13, beating the governor of Michigan to the punch by two days.

“For many engineers, that just meant bringing home their laptops. But for many on our team, the technicians working on the vehicles, working on wire harnesses, that sort of thing, they had to think about things from a different standpoint.”

He said there was one technician who was working on a wire-harness build. (A wire harness, or wiring harness, is made up of wire, terminals and connectors that relay electric power and other information from one end of the vehicle to the other.) “We needed to get these wire harnesses built so we could continue with our testing, so he pulled together the connectors, the pins, the crimping tools and all the documentation. He took it all with him on that Friday.

“The following Monday, when the ordinance from the state came to stay home, that technician was already prepared to do work. He went down into his basement, got an old dining room table that had wheels on it so he could move it around, and created his own workspace down there. He would check in with the engineers to make sure everything was on track, they would have periodic discussions and he could share videos of what he was working on.

“Those are things that are happening all over the organization; we’re just finding new ways to achieve the same mission.”

Another example: “You may have an engineer who took a test car home with him and he’s running into a problem. Now he can have a live Zoom meeting with another engineer who could be on the other side of the country. In real time, they are diagnosing and debugging together. This all came about because of this social distancing thing, but now it’s becoming more mainstream.

“This could be the wave of the future. I won’t always have to go down to the garage (in the Farmington Hills facility) or out to our facility in Arizona to investigate an issue and debug it. We can do it in real time using the technology that we have at our fingertips.”

Flotkoetter talked passionately about creativity, and how this pandemic might result in some innovative new products. For instance, he said Nissan’s rear-door alert came about after one of the engineers left a lasagna in the back seat. And “because of a plague, Sir Isaac Newton had to go back to his family’s farm. It was there that he developed his theories of gravity and motion.”

“When you have the opportunity to go outside your normal environment, you think of things differently. I think interesting innovations will come out of this.”

But the conversation kept returning to the challenges that working from home might bring.

“We’ve found that there’s a blurred line between home life and work life,” he said. “I’ve heard, ‘Dad, you’re working more hours,’ and I have been working more hours because there’s no shutting down, per se. When I’m at the office and my day ends, I can shut off my computer and go out to my car and drive home. Now, my work is here at home with me, so if there’s work to be done, I do it. I’ve heard that many of the engineers are working more hours as a result of that.”

Hmmm. Maybe. Perhaps they’re on the job, but I’m not sure they’d always be working.

Years ago, when I was writing a column, I decided I could write it from home; there was no reason to go into the office, except maybe to pick up my mail. If I applied discipline, I could be at my computer by 9, rattle off a masterpiece by noon and have the rest of the day to myself. Or so I thought.

So I would get up in the morning and get dressed. So far so good. Because I didn’t have to be anywhere, I would then have breakfast and read the morning paper. Sometimes I would dawdle. I would then sit down at the computer at 10, ready to go. But then — this being summer and the doors would be open with just the screen doors keeping out the bugs — I would hear the letter carrier come.

Naturally, I had to check the mail. And, also naturally, that would be the day Maclean’s magazine would arrive. So I would make a coffee and read Maclean’s. Then it would be noon and time for lunch and reruns of “I Love Lucy” and “Leave It To Beaver.” At 1 p.m., I would sit down at my computer and think that I would have an award winner done by 4.

Then I would hear a big truck squeak to a stop in front of my house. Two minutes later, there would be a knock at the door and my friend Fred, who worked for the city, would invite himself in for tea. At 3, after I got rid of him, I would sit down and start typing and then my pet cat Nigel, who I hadn’t seen all day, would be scratching at the door to be let in and naturally we’d have to have a reunion (he was the king of the forest, by the way, and frequently needed patching up) and by that time it would be 4 and people would start arriving home after working all day at their offices and getting lots done.

My deadline was 11 p.m. I would sit down at my computer at 9 and rattle off something run-of-the-mill and then swear to exert some self-discipline the next day when I would have to write another column, but I rarely did. My point is that my days started fairly early in the morning, but I often didn’t send in my column till late at night. And that is the danger, for some people, of working at home.

To get around that, Flotkoetter said, Nissan North America already has a virtual office policy in place and he thinks this shutdown might lead to some enhancements. “It’s a good opportunity for us to step back and reflect on how we’re doing our jobs, which could lead to some changes to that policy. I think we’re learning now what works, what are the major challenges, how we can improve the home office environment (he said Zoom has turned out to be a godsend to hold staff meetings) and I think we’ll take a hard look at that once we all get back together.”

Meantime, as he had throughout our conversation, Flotkoetter kept returning to the challenges presented by working remotely. “For instance, I don’t think that anybody would ever wish that we had more traffic in the Detroit area — which is plenty — but a lot of the testing we do depends on normal traffic flows. Right now, the roads are fairly empty, as you would expect, and this actually impacts our testing. Some of our features depend on traffic for us to evaluate how the features are performing.”

Flotkoetter said some of the engineers who work on radio and audio systems haven’t had any trouble taking their work home with them. “Usually, we do that in a lab environment, but now we have them doing it in their driveways,” he said.

“So, if you come across somebody sitting in their driveway with the sound turned up, it might not be that they’re listening to a last, favourite song before calling it a day. They are likely evaluating the audio system on that vehicle.”

He said this experience is going to be a good learning opportunity for all industries across the board.

“When you think how we’re using remote offices and virtual situations, I think this will provide us with a lot of learning that will help guide us in the future. This might ultimately change the way in which we do our business, going forward.”",[],1973,0.8935010714990705

I was thinking about that expression and how it applies to the COVID-19 crisis, as rumours have been flying about police stopping and ticketing people just for driving.

As our understanding of COVID-19 to evolves, the internet has been a great source of information and connecting with others, but it is also a breeding ground for misinformation.

To help set the record straight, I asked Sgt. Kerry Schmidt of the highway safety division of the Ontario Provincial Police to provide clarity on these rumours.

Schmidt says that although road traffic volume has been greatly reduced in the past month, far too many drivers are taking advantage of the open roads to drive recklessly, which puts themselves, other motorists and the police at risk.

Reckless driving leads to more collisions and injuries and puts additional strain on hospitals that are already managing an influx of patients related to COVID-19.

Last weekend alone, 30 drivers in the GTA were stopped and their vehicles impounded and licences suspended for street racing and/or stunt driving. On average, 10 vehicles per day in Ontario are taken off the roads for speeding or stunt driving.

In Toronto, from March 15 to 30, police issued 35 per cent more speeding tickets than during the same two-week period last year. In York Region, tickets issued for stunt driving were up 60 per cent in March, compared to March 2019.

The message that Schmidt wants to share with the public is that drivers need to obey all traffic laws and public health guidelines. That means “slowing down and driving responsibly.” Schmidt stressed that the OPP will not take a break from enforcing public safety and traffic laws.

During this COVID-19 crisis, police (like everyone else) are trying to limit close contact with the public, which explains why police stations in Ontario are closed indefinitely (stations are accessible through phone and website). Police do not want to be a source of transmission of this disease or to be in contact with someone who may have COVID-19.

One of the most persistent rumours is that police are stopping drivers randomly and asking them where they live and to explain where they are going, and why, and ticketing vehicles that are carrying too many people.

According to Schmidt, that’s not true. At this time, there are no travel restrictions in place anywhere in the province, and no checkpoints. Nor are police ticketing cars with multiple passengers under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act.

However, Schmidt suggests that drivers listen to the recommendations of Public Health. but ignoring their recommendations is not an offence. He reiterated that Public Health has specific recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Drivers should understand that not only speeding and stunt driving are dangerous on the roads, but all types of reckless driving, including driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and distracted driving.

If there is a central message that Schmidt needs the public to understand, it is this: please slow down and use common sense. He says Ontario is still under a state of emergency and all citizens need to do their part to help flatten the curve.

“The job of the highway traffic division is to ensure the safety, security and protection of all Ontario citizens who are using the roadways,” Schmidt says. “It’s everyone’s job to obey the rules of the road and to follow the guidelines of health officials.”",[],592,0.9013162735108398

In fact, it’s understated.

Civilized.

Friendly people.

Gorgeous scenery.

And some fabulous roads on which to test a car, which Lady Leadfoot and I recently did.

Last week, we told you about the Kiwi Nissan Qashqai we drove.

Today, more about the roads and the driving culture here.

Each of the North and South Islands is worth more than the two weeks we had in total, so a brief summary will have to suffice.

We did the South Island by train.

But this is a car column, so North Island it is.

We started in Auckland, the country’s largest city. It must be beautiful beneath all the hoarding; it’s being torn to shreds in preparation for next year’s defence of the country’s America’s Cup yachting victory in 2017.

Lots of detours and road closures, so rather than drive, we walked everywhere.

New Zealand is basically a bunch of mostly dormant volcanoes, so it is very hilly. My “thunder thighs” soon turned to jelly.

Time to hit the road.

We spent much of our trip following the country’s main north-south highway, Highway 1.

Our Qashqai had SatNav — “Doris of the Dashboard” to use my Motoring TV cohort Graeme Fletcher’s classic phrase.

Back home, our SatNav would say, “Make a left turn, and follow 401.”

Here, they put the definite article in front of the road number, so it would say “Make a left turn left, and follow the 401.”

This SatNav added a twist. “Doris” would phrase an instruction in her charming accent, but with a slight hesitation: “Make a left ‘turn’ and follow ... The One ...”

Made it sound like a religious experience.

If you know anything about New Zealand at all, you might guess that its No. 1 industry is raising sheep.

No shortage of them, although recently, raising cattle has become increasingly important.

Based on our trip, my guess would be: manufacturing orange plastic traffic pylons, “30 km/h” speed limit signs for the construction zones, and the “TEMPORARY” signs that invariably accompany them.

To their credit, New Zealand drivers generally follow these strictures.

It is late summer here, so the old Canadian joke applies — there are two seasons, “winter” and “road construction” — so we saw lots of those signs.

New Zealand keeps its roads in pretty good condition, although given its latitude (Auckland’s is about the same “south” as San Francisco’s is “north”) they don’t have a lot of snow or frost heaves to worry about.

As noted last week, even their newly paved roads aren’t baby-bum smooth. As in England, they put some texture into the surface, presumably to provide more grip when the road is wet.

Given that you’re never much farther than 100 kilometres from the ocean, the weather can be changeable.

Instead of “If you don’t like the weather, wait 20 minutes,” they say, “If you don’t like the weather, look behind you.”

On most days, the forecast indicated a chance of rain. But weather people everywhere always say that, because if they’re wrong, everybody’s still happy.

Except farmers and forest firefighters.

Whatever, we had excellent weather for most of our stay.

Police presence on the roads wasn’t oppressive, although we did see a couple of cars pulled over, presumably for speeding.

There are occasional yahoos, usually in pickup trucks, driving with no concern for fellow road users.

But overall, their driving culture is like the rest of the country — again, civilized.

“Utes” are quite popular here. The car/pickup truck hybrids originated in Australia when a woman wrote to the head of Ford Australia in the early 1930s, saying their family needed something to take the pigs to market on Saturday and the family to church on Sunday, but could only afford one vehicle.

Some of you may remember such vehicles as the Chevrolet El Camino and Ford Ranchero? They’d be “utes.”

From Auckland, we headed north in the direction of “Ninety Mile Beach.”

Yes, New Zealand does use the metric system. So what’s with the “Mile” in that name?

The beach in fact is about 90 kilometres long. Sorry, I don’t have an answer for that ...

At first, we had planned to drive all the way to the top, to Mile 1. Then we figured, each mile of beach is pretty much the same as every other mile. Or kilometre.

It was still summer, but too chilly for a swim, so we turned back south, yes, following (dramatic pause ...) “ ... The One ...”

At Kaitaia, we veered west toward the Tasman Sea, then south on Highway 12 (Doris: “follow ... The Twelve ...”) so we could see the “Tane Mahuta,” which is a giant kauri tree, an endangered species in its native land.

It is some 45 metres tall, and is estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,500 years old. Breathtaking to be in the presence of a living thing that old.

The tree was “discovered” (meaning, “stumbled upon by people of European descent”) in 1928 while “ ... The Twelve ...” was being built.

This road had the most optimistic speed limit I can recall. Extremely twisty two-laner, narrow to non-existent shoulders, tough sight lines.

100 km/h? Yikes.

Maybe this is why New Zealand has produced on a per capita basis a surprisingly large number of remarkable race car drivers over the years, such as Bruce McLaren, Denny Hulme, Chris Amon and, more recently, Brendon Hartley.

We don’t have many three-lane roads in Canada anymore, but they’re popular here. Two lanes uphill, one lane downhill. Plenty of warning when they’re coming up, to discourage dicey passing.

But they make the same mistake most Canadian provinces do. They add a lane on the right for passing (they drive on the left, remember), which is as it should be.

However, when they shrink the road back to a single lane, they take away the driving lane forcing people to merge right.

That’s just stupid.

How can the “driving” lane ever disappear?

They should just swap their warning signs for ours and we’d both be correct.

Continuing southeast to Rotorua, the centre of both Maori culture and volcanic activity, with geysers spouting regularly.

We were tourists, so excuse us for taking in the tourist sights, such as a traditional Maori cultural performance and dinner, and the glow worm caves — millions of the little creatures, winking away at us.

They also have an exhibit for the kiwi, the universal symbol of New Zealand. These nocturnal flightless birds are extremely shy and hard to see even in captivity. Some patience on our part led to eventual success, but photography is not allowed, so you’ll have to take my word for it.

Down to Wellington, our detour to the South Island, then back north to Napier on the Atlantic (eastern) coast.

By this time, the effects of the “corona” virus, as it was still being called, were starting to take effect.

New Zealand’s rate of infection is still one of the lowest in the world, but hotel rooms and dinner reservations became easier to get as people were cancelling travel plans.

Our final touristy stop was Coromandel, which again was much quieter than usual.

The road to this town looks fine on the map. But the last 40 kilometres took about an hour and a half to cover.

Lady Leadfoot did her best not to gasp every time we came to a corner.

We were heading north and her seat was on the “ocean” side.

The road is narrow.

It was dark.

There were big trucks.

No guard rails for most of it.

The fact that I am writing this means we survived.

And we are still married.

The return trip the next day was even scarier. Not just because I was now on the “ocean” side, but because in broad daylight, I could see how narrow the road was.

And how big those trucks were.

By the time we got to Auckland, the airport was restricted to just passengers. Ours turned out to be the second-last Air Canada flight to leave the country.

Darn. Another month or two here could have worked.

So “Kia Ore,” a Maori expression which seems to cover everything from “HI!” to “Have a nice day.”

If you ever get the chance to go to New Zealand, take it.

What is like to work on the front lines of this health crisis?

I recently asked Natalia Kusendova that very question. Kusendova is the MPP for the riding of Mississauga Centre, and the youngest female member of provincial Parliament.

Several weeks ago, she added the extra duties of her previous career and has taken up a role as a registered nurse in the emergency department at Etobicoke General Hospital, while continuing her duties as an MPP.

As Kusendova explains, returning to nursing at this time is no different than her reasoning for getting into politics: “I wanted to impact my community in a positive way,” she says.

Working in an emergency room during this health crisis does not strike fear into Kusendova’s heart. On the contrary, she is motivated and energized by the high level of professionalism and organization at her hospital, by the levels of co-operation among various levels of government, and by the support from individuals and businesses.

Hospitals like Etobicoke General have introduced safety measures and protocols to ensure that doctors, nurses, staff members and patients are protected and safeguarded at all times. The stream of COVID-19 patients (as opposed to potential surges) has not overtaxed the system and led to panic situations.

Kusendova realizes that people might be fearful about going to a hospital during the COVID-19 crisis, and she wants to reassure the public that hospitals are safe environments. There is currently an adequate supply of intensive-care beds and ventilators to accommodate the health-care needs of the public.

Kusendova believes that the province’s state of emergency (declared on March 16) has been a significant factor in limiting the number of COVID-19 cases. It bans people from gathering in public spaces and it outlaws events with gatherings of more than five people.

She reiterates that if you are having mild symptoms and suspect COVID-19, please call Telehealth first at 1-866-797-0000. If you are having moderate to severe symptoms like difficulty breathing or chest pain, please visit to an emergency room right away. People are urged not to visit an assessment centre unless they have been referred by a health-care professional.

Kusendova is also encouraged by the actions of citizens to self-isolate at home and obey the guidelines from public health officials. “These preventative actions by Ontarians have helped to thwart a surge in COVID-19 cases,” she says. “We are apart, but we are all in this together.”

She understands that people are anxious, stressed and fearful, but says it’s important to keep going and not give up. She advises people at home to utilize online tools and platforms to communicate with friends and loved ones.

Indeed, many Ontarians may be experiencing mental health issues in dealing with the isolation and uncertainties of their personal circumstances, in which case Kusendova recommends contacting health-care professionals for help (visit 211Ontario.ca).

Kusendova commends the province in providing emergency funding of up to $12 million to immediately expand online and virtual mental health supports, and $2.6 million to hire new psychologists and other mental health workers to support Ontario Provincial Police personnel.

Kusendova is also encouraged by the level of support from businesses and individuals across the province. The provincial government recently launched the $50-million Ontario Together Fund, to help willing businesses provide essential medical supplies and equipment.

92,https://www.thestar.com/autos/opinion/2020/04/17/sir-stirling-moss-and-the-canadian-connection.html,6,car drive rear wheel seat race driver road,93,thestar,Sir Stirling Moss and the Canadian Connection,'Norris Mcdonald',2020-04-17 00:00:00,"Sir Stirling Moss, who died last weekend at 90 following a long illness, was no stranger to Canada.

The man who was, arguably, the most famous racing driver of all time, married his first wife, Katharine (Katie) Stuart Molson, of the Molson beer family of Montreal, in October 1957.

And he was instrumental in the design of Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, née Mosport, when he suggested that a turn at the south end of the circuit not be a hairpin but a sweeping turn with two corners. As a result, turns 5A and 5B were named Moss Corner.

We know the first to be true; marriages are a matter of public record. But the second? Might it be a myth? Let’s examine the evidence.

In two official Mosport histories, one by Chuck McLaren and the second by the late Bob Brockington, it is written that Moss, in 1960, was visiting Toronto and saw plans for the track. While he liked the layout, which had been designed by Alan Bunting, with input from Ray Liddle, he did suggest that the single-radius carousel hairpin at the track’s south end be changed to a 90-degree right followed by another right leading to the back straight — 5A and 5B.

This information is also included in the history of the circuit that’s on the CTMP website. And none of the Canadian racing historians — John Wright, Bob Harrington — or retired racing drivers — Walt MacKay, Jim Bray, Ludwig Heimrath — I talked to, or heard from, this week said anything that would discount this.

But the late Len Coates, in a book he published in 1973, “Challenge: the story of Canadian road racing,” told a different story. A reception was held two days before the first Player’s 200 sports car race in 1961 and Moss and two other world-class drivers of the day, Olivier Gendebien and Jo Bonnier, were featured guests.

“When they were pressed to discuss Mosport’s weak points,” Coates wrote in his book, “Gendebien and Bonnier said Moss Corner was too slow and offered little challenge to car or driver. Said Gendebien: ‘You brake, go around and accelerate. It’s too slow.’

“Bonnier nodded in agreement and looked dubious when he was told that Moss himself had designed the corner. ‘It must have been a misunderstanding,’ he said. ‘Moss likes to go fast. It’s not his type of corner.’

“This sent the reporters scurrying to Moss and he denied that he ever made any suggestions about the corner.”

Which comes as a bit of a surprise. But who really knows? Most, if not all, of the original committee members are dead and everybody I talked to about this seemed quite surprised.

To further muddy the waters, Heimrath said that Moss was in Canada earlier, in 1959, and “working on the track then.” How could that be? Well, Moss was a member of the Molson family at that time and it’s not beyond the realm of possibility that the original group, who were looking for financing to build Mosport, might have pitched Molson’s. It’s part of the history of Le Circuit-Mont Tremblant that Labatt came through with the last chunk of cash needed to build that place, so why wouldn’t Molson have been approached to fund Mosport, in whole or in part?

Whatever, Heimrath, who won three Canadian driving championships, including his first in 1961, raced against Moss on several occasions and said he was the best. “If he decided he was going to do something, like pass you, there was nothing you could do about it,” he said. “And he was the nicest guy to talk to; I never heard him say a bad thing about another driver. He was a true gentleman,” said the Canadian legend, who’s mellowed in recent years.

MacKay, of Caledon, didn’t race against Moss in that first Player’s 200, but he did drive in a 40-lap Formula Jr. race that was on the same program and he won it in a Lotus 18. That evening, during an awards ceremony at the Flying Dutchman Motor Hotel in Bowmanville, Moss gave him a trophy and a cheque for $400, “which kept me going for the rest of the season — mostly to keep my ’55 Chevy tow car running.” MacKay was surprised that Moss might not have been involved in the Moss Corner design. “I never heard that,” he said.

Jim Bray of Brantford, who raced in the production sports car race that was held just before the main event, was lapped by Moss (who drove in several races that day), “and he gave me his customary wave as he drove past.” Bray said he met Moss years later at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in England and Moss said, “You drove a Sprite in that race, didn’t you? I remember — you were a hooligan!” Bray said he didn’t mind the name that Moss had called him, he was just delighted that the legend remembered him. He also was — and remains — convinced that Sir Stirling had a hand in the redesign of his corner.

Other reminiscences:

Sid Priddle, who was handling media relations for one of the Player’s races at Mosport, was rushing to get Moss to CFTO-TV in then-Agincourt for an interview when he was pulled over on Ellesmere Road for speeding. “Who do you think you are?” the cop said. “Stirling Moss?” Priddle said he had to close the car window quickly before Sir Stirling started to give lip to the officer.

Nelson Hudes, a marketing assistant at Mosport, recalls being taken for a ride around the track by Moss in 1985 when Sir Stirling had come to Mosport to race a Cooper Formula Jr. in a Vintage Auto Racing Association of Canada (VARAC) support race during a Can-Am Series weekend. “Sir Stirling was driving, F. David Stone (marketing manager) was beside him in the front seat, F. David’s wife Janice was beside me in the back. We got to Moss Corner and — I’m not making this up — Stirling Moss spun the car. It was drizzling slightly but the track wasn’t wet. He just lost it. He was quick to say that he hadn’t done it on purpose, but we knew.”

John Wright, of Kitchener, who sent me the photo of Ed Leavens, Moss and Zsa Zsa Gabor in Las Vegas, said few Canadians knew that Leavens, a London, Ont., auto dealer who raced the sports cars he sold, was a frequent co-driver of Sir Stirling’s. Wrote Wright, in an email: “Ed and Moss were teammates in the late 1950s or early 1960s at a Bonneville Speed Event with the BMC team. Ed was to drive the Sprite streamliner and Moss the “Roaring Raindrop.” I can’t remember the details, but the team took some respite at Las Vegas and it was there that someone took this photo of Ed, Sir Stirling and Ms. Gabor. Ed told me that Zsa Zsa wasn’t much interested in him, but that she was really interested in Moss ... And that photo that Bob Harrington sent of Phil Hill and Moss has to be treasured. We are losing too many of our heroes these days — a reminder that life has a 100 per cent death rate!”

Stirling Moss was knighted by Prince Charles for Service to the Empire in March 2000. He won 212 of the 529 races he entered while driving 84 makes of cars, including Mercedes, Lotus, Vanwall, Porsches, Maseratis, Jaguars, Ferraris, Aston Martins, Listers and Coopers. Although he won 16 Grand Prix, he never won the world championship, but finished second four times in seven years of F1 competition and third place the other three times. His greatest victory, however, took place in Italy in the 1955 1,000-mile Mille Miglia for sports cars. With journalist Dennis Jenkinson navigating, they finished the race in 10 hours and seven minutes, which was described by Motor Trend magazine as the “most epic drive, ever.” Moss was in such a rhythm that he took his girlfriend for an all-night drive, stopping for breakfast in Munich and lunch in Stuttgart.

He was involved in two massive accidents, the first at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit during practice for the Belgian Grand Prix in 1960 and the second at Goodwood in England in 1962, which left him in a coma for a month. He retired following a private test session the following year in which he determined his skills were too diminished for him to compete for victories.

He was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990. Being very patriotic, he was once quoted as saying, “Better to lose honourably in a British car than win in a foreign one.”

In the words of Bill Warner, of the Amelia Island Councours d’Elegance, “he was witty, charming, warm and accommodating.”

And a helluva race driver, too.

Now, a personal note.

When I got on the Globe and Mail in 1965, I was assigned to edit copy on what was called “the rim.” I worked alongside geniuses, men and women who had heads full of facts and figures that would come in handy when they’d be on deadline and have to insert something into a story to give it context and they’d be able to write it in because they didn’t have to look it up, they just knew.

One of those brilliant people was Jim Shuttleworth. We’d been kids in Kapuskasing back in the late 1940s, early ’50s. Jim had flaming red hair when he was young, earning him the schoolyard nickname “Woodpecker” after Woody, which was eventually shortened to “Pecker.”

So I’m on my second shift and they’re bringing me along slowly, which means I got to report for work early, and at 6 p.m., the late shift arrives. As they start to work, I look at these new (to me) faces and there, three chairs over, is none other than Jim Shuttleworth. “Hi Pecker,” I say, and Jim turns slowly toward me and his eyes widen behind the round glasses he’s wearing and he says these exact words: “Well, if I live and breath, if it’s not that scrawny, snotty, asthmatic kid from Kapuskasing, Norris McDonald. Does security know you’re in here? And put out that cigarette.”

Jim had graduated in journalism from Ryerson and although he was working in news at that time, his first love was sports and he was eventually able to live his dream when he was appointed assistant sports editor (at a time when the assistant ran the section, the editor being the manager).

He was with that paper for 31 years and he was one of the best. In a business that — at least, in those days — attracted a lot of people who really didn’t know what they wanted to do when they grew up, Jim knew who he was — and that was someone you could count on. The Globe benefited greatly from his presence.

James Robert Shuttleworth passed on March 21 at Nanaimo General Hospital in British Columbia, where he’d moved — with the Star’s Wendy Darroch, who died in 2009 — following his retirement as production editor of the Report on Business. He was in his 84th year and leaves his sons, Fraser and Geoffrey, and his sister, Mary Anne.

My reward? Two freebie business-class tickets anywhere Air Canada flies.

You’re not going to use them for a weekend in Montreal.

So Auckland, New Zealand, it was, about as far away from Toronto as Air Canada goes, for myself and the ever-patient Lady Leadfoot.

A fortuitous reunion at last fall’s Los Angeles Auto Show with Stephen Lester, formerly managing director for INFINITI Canada and currently in that same position for Nissan Australia, led to him putting me in touch with John Manley, his counterpart for Nissan New Zealand.

John graciously offered a brand-new Nissan Qashqai for a two-week road test.

I’ll tell you about the car this week.

Next week, I’ll tell you a bit about driving Down Under.

The Qashqai they get in New Zealand is pretty much the same as ours — a compact crossover/SUV/station wagon.

Theirs are built in England, while ours come from Kyushu, Japan.

Our tester listed at $45,490 NZD, which would work out to about $38,670 Canadian.

Equalizing equipment levels and specs as best as I could figure, model for model, New Zealand Qashqais are about $3,000 more expensive than ours.

Our tester was their range-topping Ti model, roughly equivalent to our Platinum trim. It’s fully belled and whistled, including SatNav, leather and all the safety goodies, about which more later.

“Kiwi-qais” get essentially the same powertrain we do — a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder engine pushing out 106 kW (141 horsepower) at 6,000 r.p.m. and 200 Newton-metres (147 lb.-ft.) of torque at 4,400 r.p.m., working through a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

Qashqai is offered here only with front-wheel drive, which is available back home, but only in the lowest trim level, and very few are sold.

In Canada, Qashqai also offers a six-speed manual transmission, which is not available here.

Our tester was equipped with the same Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires as my Targa Newfoundland Nissan Juke NISMO RS Turbo. They were predictably brilliant.

Our car was painted a bright blue. “Vivid” is the paint name, and it’s appropriate. We saw a few other new Qashqais in this shade, and it works very well with the car’s shape.

The biggest difference between their Qashqais and ours is, obviously, theirs are right-hand drive.

I’ve driven RHD cars fairly frequently, so it was no biggie once I got reacclimated to looking up and to the left for the rear-view mirror instead of up and to the right.

You also must be careful making right-hand turns, especially in town, to ensure you don’t “wrong-slot.”

But it was new for Lady Leadfoot to be sitting “over there” without a steering wheel in her hands. Both of us sometimes started to open the wrong door when we got into the car.

Some right-hand-drive cars use the same steering column as left-hookers, and just move it over.

Others mirror-image the control stalks, keeping the turn-signal lever closest to the driver’s-side door — hence, backwards to ours, and so operated with the right hand.

Qashqai is one of the latter, so I occasionally would switch on the turn signal when it started to rain, or turn on the wipers to indicate a lane change. Fortunately, New Zealand drivers are generally very patient.

Also, all the minor controls you are used to working with your right hand — HVAC, SatNav, sound system, etc. — you have to work with your left. Unless you’re part of about 10 per cent of the population that’s left-handed, this is a bit of an issue.

Again, Lady Leadfoot to the rescue. She worked all those functions for us.

Targa New Zealand took place just the week before we got there; I wonder how Messieurs Lester and Manley would have reacted if I had arrived a week earlier and put the Qashqai through that? For sure, I would have needed to find a different navigator. And possibly another wife.

Driven sanely, the Qashqai felt big enough to be comfortable, and small enough to be easy to handle on New Zealand’s narrow roads and dense downtown traffic.

Nissan’s “zero gravity” seats were really put to the test, given we were covering several hundred klicks on some of our driving days. Never a problem — these are among the most comfortable and supportive seats you will find at any price.

Yes, as usual, I would have preferred they not be covered in leather, but I get that I’m in the tiny minority here.

Gasoline, like everything else down here, is expensive, typically around $2 NZD a litre ($1.67 CDN). One more reason, in addition to the topography and climate, that British Columbians would feel right at home here.

We got around 7.5 L/100 km in mixed city/highway driving, which I didn’t think was too bad, given the hilly country we were in most of the time. New Zealand is basically a bunch of volcanoes, most of which are thankfully dormant.

The engine is reasonably quiet and unobtrusive. It motivates the car well, keeping up with traffic and easily handling the aforementioned topography.

I’ve never had a problem with CVTs, although I know some people do. They just give you the optimum gear ratio for any driving situation, so what’s the big deal?

True, the exhaust note doesn’t rise and fall in step with road speed, and that takes a bit of getting used to. But think of the fuel you are saving.

Ride quality was fine — New Zealand roads aren’t always glass-smooth, so this was appreciated.

One thing I liked about our Qashqai that all too many cars get wrong — once you turn the headlights on (and, of course, all your lights should be on all the time), you can just leave the switch in that position. When you turn the car off, the lights go off, although you can set them to stay on for a short time to light your way to your front door.

Once again, I ask the question — why is there even a headlight switch in a car?

A note about Nissan’s safety kit. As always, I shut off most of the buzzers and beepers because I’d rather it be me paying attention, not just the car.

But one safety feature does do something I can’t do — provide a bird’s-eye view when I’m trying to navigate in tight quarters.

Nissan pioneered this technology, and it has evolved in the upper trim levels of Qashqai into the “Intelligent Around View Monitor.” This consists of a series of cameras, the views from which are somehow integrated to show the front, rear and both sides of the car, in addition to that “overhead” view, as you back into your parking space. (Of course you back in, don’t you?)

As I apparently never tire of telling you, whatever is beside you is always revealed in properly adjusted side-view mirrors, making those so-called blind-spot-warning systems completely irrelevant.

But unless you have a giraffe as a navigator — and for all of Lady Leadfoot’s many fine attributes, “giraffe-like” is not one of therm — this overhead view is very useful, and should save you many chipped alloy wheels, scratched fenders and dinged bumpers.

It appears real station wagons aren’t coming back any time soon, although you do see more of them here than you do back home.

Now, we didn’t really have to come to New Zealand to discover this fact. But Nissan’s Qashqai provides a roomy, comfortable, well-equipped and handy-to-drive alternative.

Who better to proffer words of wisdom than Norris McDonald, editor emeritus of the Toronto Star’s Wheels section, and the first journalist ever to be inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame?

I spoke with Norris recently about the COVID-19 crisis and asked him to share any stories or wisdom that might be a benefit to readers.

If you know Norris at all, you know that he’s a great storyteller who is rarely at a loss for words. He is also an award-winning journalist who shows no signs of slowing down.

Norris recounted a story from his days working at the Kingston Whig-Standard.

It was the early 1980s, and Canada was in a deep recession. The owner/publisher of the Whig-Standard, Michael Davies, faced a crisis at the paper. Many newspapers and media companies were laying off staff left, right and centre.

Davies wanted to avoid layoffs, and so he called a meeting with his entire staff from all departments (sales, circulation, reporters, editors, pressmen).

More than 100 staff gathered at the Grand Theatre in Kingston. There, Davies told his staff that the paper needed to boost circulation by 1,000 in order to avoid layoffs. He asked everyone to pitch in.

It was an audacious goal.

The Whig-Standard was ridiculed by staff on some of the larger newspapers. Imagine asking reporters and pressman to knock on doors to sell subscriptions? Unheard of!

When staff finished their shifts at the paper, they would go home, change, and go out canvassing for subscriptions. They did what they had to do and, within two months, the Whig-Standard had reached its goal of 1,000 new subscribers. Layoffs were avoided.

This story sent a chill down my spine. An entire company understood the dire predicament the paper was in, and knew what was at stake. As Norris said, “We had to work together back then to save jobs; now we have to work together to save lives.”

A global pandemic is a far cry from an economic recession, but there is a lesson to be learned in Norris’s story of yesteryear that applies to the COVID-19 crisis today.

We all need to do our part to get through these difficult and stressful times.

The “stay home” message has been broadcast on every media platform for weeks now, and yet some people are still playing fast and loose with the laws. They are congregating in groups, visiting parks and shopping in person for non-essential items. In doing so, they are putting themselves and others at risk.

I am the first to admit that self-isolation is tough. Being alone, at home, is a huge imposition, and many people are struggling with it. But please — do your part to minimize the risk of spreading this awful disease. Just stay home.

On behalf of the Trillium Automobile Dealers Association, I would like to acknowledge the recent passing of Rod Campbell, a legend in the automotive world.

Norris wrote a moving tribute to Campbell in last week’s Toronto Star.

Early in his career, Campbell covered racing events and sold advertising for radio before launching his own motorsports marketing and event planning company. He sold his company in 1999.

Throughout his career, Campbell befriended many motorsports drivers and industry giants, including Jackie Stewart, Roger Penske and Walter Hayes.

He was known for his tireless work ethic, his infection enthusiasm and his boundless confidence.

Campbell was also a champion of auto shows around the world, especially the Canadian International AutoShow (Campbell’s nephew, Jason, is the general manager of the CIAS.)

Can the cancellation of the 2020 Honda Indy Toronto be far behind?

And what about racing at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, Shannonville, Jukasa Motor Speedway and other small speedways in southern Ontario?

The outlook is not good. I talked to a number of people in the industry in recent days and, while they all expressed optimism, the likelihood of racing wheels turning in front of large crowds this summer and fall is practically nil.

Barring a miracle — and I repeat: a miracle — there is no way the IndyCar race at Exhibition Place, the IMSA SportsCar weekend at CTMP, the NASCAR weekend at the same place in September and the Canadian Short Track Nationals at Jukasa (a.k.a. the Bubba Pollard benefit) can take place for the following reasons:

There is no indication the COVID-19 epidemic is slowing. The number of sick, dying and dead is increasing daily. All big events in Montreal and Toronto (which means the rest of Ontario and Quebec, too) are cancelled or postponed through June, which means the earliest racing could get going is July.

But don’t think for a second that everything would suddenly be back to normal. We wouldn’t want to think we’ve beaten this thing, only to have it come back because we got careless. We will be taking baby steps. In fact, the prime minister said as much Wednesday.

Ontario would have to rescind, or modify, the five-person limit on gatherings. And there could be other conditions. Speedways might have to restrict attendance and separate people in grandstands.

The Canada-U.S. border is closed to all but essential traffic. The IndyCar circus, the NASCAR trucks and IMSA sports cars are not essential. This border has never been closed before and it will take some time before it’s wide open again. Particularly with this particular president.

Let’s take a close look at the Honda Indy. It’s scheduled to be held July 10-12. It’s run on a temporary track, so the facility has to be built. City hall, which is closed at the moment, has to reopen and be up and running in order to issue the necessary permits. The border has to be open again. The province has to lift the restrictions on gatherings. If the all-clear is sounded on July 1 (which it won’t be, but we can dream), all of the above would have to be done in 10 days for the race to happen. I suggest that is impossible.

Then, you have to wonder if racers will be able to afford to go racing. I know of two well-known Canadian racers, one who competes in the NASCAR Pinty’s Series and the other is a Canadian motorcycle champion, who have lost their lucrative personal sponsorships. They got phone calls to say their deals were cancelled.

Not reduced. Nullified.

And then there are all the small-time stock car racers, or club-level road racers, who might have been promised $2,500 if they put “Bob Smith’s Garage,” or “Avenue Road Computer Repair” on the side of their cars. They won’t be getting anything now. (Can you imagine the uproar if it was discovered that people were using business bailout money to sponsor a race car?)

Racers have been known to beg and borrow (no, racers never steal ...) to get enough money to go racing, but that’s not even an option this time because just about everybody’s broke.

In the bigs, starting with Formula One and going down the line through IndyCar, NASCAR and the rest, the racing sanctioning bodies have all laid off staff, as have most teams. Drivers and team managers have all taken pay cuts — but will that be enough? Zak Brown, who runs McLaren, said the other day that as many as four F1 teams could go out of business if this calamity continues for any length of time.

And then there are the spectators. Millions of Canadians are surviving because the federal government is giving them money. And those who are lucky enough to still be employed are watching their pennies. There is not a lot of disposable income around, no matter how you look at the situation.

As a result, you can split racing fans into three groups: Group A, who will go to the races no matter what; Group B, who won’t be able to afford to go, and Group C, who won’t want to have anything to do with crowds. So right off, whether it’s the IndyCar race, or the NASCAR trucks at CTMP (assuming they are able to be held), two-thirds of the customer base won’t attend. In the words of one speedway manager I talked to this week, this would be like having a rainout a month in advance.

(Although we’re talking about racing here, this model could be applied to hockey and baseball and all the other big-league professional sports. There will be a huge financial reckoning and adjustment when this is over, that’s for sure.)

The one race that could happen would be the Grand Prix. Everybody in the circus comes from Europe, so there wouldn’t be a problem with the U.S. border. The Montreal Grand Prix circuit and infrastructure is in place year-round, so they could hold the race as late as Thanksgiving weekend in October. And Montreal could lean on the Quebec government to ease the gathering limit so that the city could receive an injection of much-needed economic activity. Like the Honda Indy in Toronto, the Grand Prix means hotel rooms and that industry in both cities desperately needs customers.

John Bondar, the new proprietor, with a partner, of Shannonville Motorsports Park, is one track operator who’s sounding seriously optimistic. That doesn’t mean CTMP is standing still. Following the cancellation of the traditional Victoria Day SpeedFest long weekend in May, they’ve been “planning backwards,” starting with the Chevy Silverado 250 NASCAR trucks race in September and coming back to the motorcycle weekend in August and the IMSA SportsCar Grand Prix in July, figuring the trucks might — might — have a chance of racing. And they have other contingency plans in the works, like invitational races or club racers mixed in with the professionals. If they can open for business, that is.

“We’re all suddenly experts on this thing,” Bondar said, talking about the pandemic. “Nobody can say for sure, but I think — hope — that July might be reasonable to plan for some on-track action (where he could run motorcycle races or club car events over, say, three days with the entry split into three groups of 40 max and no mothers or girlfriends or other crew allowed if — if — the gathering limits went back up to 50).

“I think the (COVID-19) numbers will start to come down at the end of April,” he said. “We then spend all of May watching them roll down further and then, to be on the safe side, we don’t do anything in June. We could go in July and I think if the province returns to a 50-person limit, I’ll be OK.

“The U.S. is a disaster. They are way behind us in getting a handle on this thing. So we want to keep the border closed till they’re out of the woods. That’s not good news for CTMP, whose headliners are Americans, or some of the speedways that have big races and need Americans to deepen the field. But the country can’t afford to take any chances.”

I have a friend who works in the automotive industry. I think he’s a genius.

We were talking about COVID-19 (what else?) and Pete says: “I see quite a few people walking around now with masks on. Good for them. But then I got thinking ... if you want many more people to wear a mask, put a sports logo on it. The Raptors, or TFC. Winner teams.

“If you’re an IndyCar fan, you could wear a mask with the IndyCar logo on it (see illustration). Or NASCAR or F1. Perhaps even the individual teams, or drivers.

“Look, one way or the other, they will run the Indy 500 this year. They moved it from May to August; I figure it will be held in late September or early October. Whenever, can you visualize a couple of hundred thousand people at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway wearing masks that have IndyCar on them? Or Penske Corp? Or the Indianapolis Speedway logo?

“By then the NFL will be going, too. People will want to get out to the games. They will go if they wear a mask with the Patriots or the Bears or the Colts logo. The Bills and so on.

“Wearing a mask is not cool. Wearing a mask with your favourite sports team on it would make it cool. It will get more people to wear masks and help flatten the curve.

“People are at home with time on their hands. They can sew their own. Some have 3D printers and can make them that way. With the internet and social media, people will pick up on this within hours.”

As I said, I think he’s a genius.

BMW 750Li xDrive. 4 doors, 4/5 passengers, full-size luxury sedan. Part-time automatic four-wheel drive.

Price: Base list — $126,900. As tested — $156,300.

Engine: 4.4-litre V-8, double overhead camshafts, four valves per cylinder, variable valve timing, twin turbocharged, direct injection.

Power/torque, horsepower / lb.-ft.: 523 @ 5,500 — 6,000 r.p.m. / 553 @ 1,600 — 4,600 r.p.m.

Fuel consumption, NRCan City/Highway, l/100 km: 14.5 / 9.9. Premium unleaded fuel.

Competition: Audi A8, Jaguar XJ, Mercedes-Benz S-Class.

What’s best: Excellent dynamics for such a large car; opulent interior; strong image.

What’s worst: As always, the digital dashboard borders on hopeless; shift pattern just plain wrong; run-flat tires still not ready for prime time.

What’s interesting: Under all the gloss, it’s still a BMW.

I had driven about 20 kilometres from BMW’s head office in Richmond Hill down the 404 to 401 westbound, heading home in a brand-new 750Li sedan.

Flipping the metaphorical coin, I chose the express lanes.

Almost immediately, I hit a massive pothole, which I think may have already collected a Volkswagen and a couple of motorcycles.

The loud “BANG” from the right front corner told me I had blown a tire — a fact almost immediately corroborated by a warning light on the dashboard.

I hate run-flat tires, because I don’t trust them to “run flat,” the ride quality is usually awful all the time and they don’t provide a spare I could change myself.

Not that there was any place to change the tire, because the 401’s shoulders there are about half a car wide.

I personally know people who have been killed in just such a situation. I was not about to join their ranks.

So I put on the four-ways and trundled along at 45 km/h until I could find a safe spot to pull off near the Avenue Road exit.

The owners manual suggested I contact the nearest BMW dealer or roadside assistance. I thought, what if I had been driving through Kapuskasing at 4 a.m.?

By sheer good luck, a CAA tow truck happened along. The driver stopped to see if I needed help and within minutes, the car was on his flatbed and we were headed back to BMW.

Triple YAY! for CAA.

I retrieved the car the next day, and so the story can continue.

This car starts at $126,900. My tester had a boatload of options, which brought the total to $156,300.

The updated 7 Series continues with several traditional BMW styling cues such as the twin-kidney grille and the “Hofmeister kink” — the forward kickback of the rear roof pillars.

Speaking over the years with BMW stylists, they always say such things are helpful in that they provide a guide as to how to start styling the car. But these things are also somewhat restrictive, limiting their creativity.

Still, it’s a handsome beast, and everyone will know which brand you chose.

Power is provided by a 4.4-litre, twin-turbocharged V-8 — the last two digits of BMW’s model designations stopped having any relationship to the engine’s displacement long ago.

It generates 523 horsepower from 5,500 to 6,000 r.p.m., and a flat torque “plateau” of 553 lb.-ft. from 1,800 to 4,600 r.p.m.

The turbos are nestled between the banks of the engine’s “vee” to minimize the path the compressed air must take to reach those hungry cylinders.

A hard stomp on the throttle is followed by a brief pause while the car decides it wants to go. Once it does, it really goes — 0 to 100 km/h takes a shade over four seconds, which is quick by any standard.

The stop-start function that saves a few droplets of fuel isn’t as smooth in operation as some such systems, causing a noticeable shake and grumble as the engine coughs back to life.

The eight-speed automatic transmission provides power to all four wheels as is deemed necessary to maintain traction, although it is primarily a rear-drive car, consistent with BMW’s hallowed traditions.

Sadly, the transmission is controlled by a shift lever that can only be described as stupid.

It looks like the normal PRNDL (Park Reverse Neutral Drive Low) setup that has governed autoboxes since approximately the dawn of time.

But it’s not.

To get Park, instead of shoving the lever full-forward, you have to hit a button on the lever itself.

To avoid the obvious issue — people not hitting this correctly, the car rolling away, the concomitant lawsuits — the car seems to automatically select Park when you open a door.

Great — more technology to go wrong in 10 years.

BMW is not alone on this — Mercedes and others do it, too. “Why?” remains the question.

Frankly, the best way to handle this is what Lincoln, GM, Honda and others have done. Nobody shifts gears any more, so just dispense with the shift lever altogether and use push buttons on the dashboard somewhere.

The centre console is the most expensive real estate in the world — use it for stuff that needs it.

The standard air suspension on the 7 provides an excellent ride — they have obviously addressed the ride-quality issues that used to plague run-flat-tire-equipped cars.

You can also raise the car about 50 millimetres to help negotiate steep parking lot ramps or rough roads. It only works for a short time and at low speeds, then automatically returns to normal.

“Comfort” or “Sport” driving programs provide predetermined settings for a variety of functions such as ride firmness, handling and transmission response.

A third option, “Individual,” allows you to set your own preferred combination of choices.

My tester had the optional four-wheel steering, which turns the rear wheels counter-phase at low speeds to make the car more manoeuvrable, and in-phase at higher speeds to improve response and stability. I found it impossible to feel the transition, so it must do its job well.

Handling has long been a BMW hallmark, and this car’s agility belies its size and weight.

The interior is lovely, beautifully finished from obviously high-quality materials that all appear to be authentic — if it looks like wood, metal or ceramic, it probably is.

There is loads of room everywhere, and about a million seat adjustments, so anyone should be able to find a comfortable and supportive seating position.

Included in that option list were a couple of “Executive” packages, bringing features such as ventilated seats with massage function for the fronts, window shades and a bunch of so-called “driving aids” like self-steering, which I find massively annoying.

It also included the damnable “Driving Assistant,” who kept asking what I wanted her to do.

“SHUT UP!” apparently is not in her vocabulary.

I eventually found her off button.

If this is the “Ultimate Driving Machine,” why would I not want to drive it myself?

I also shut off the heads-up display, which I always find more distracting than helpful.

As with any new car, it will take you some time to get used to the minor controls.

BMW was one of the first to “digitize” the driving experience, and those early attempts at the so-called “iDrive” system were beyond hopeless. We spent half an hour with a German engineer on an early 7 Series program some years ago. It took him that long to show us how to change a radio station, and it still took about seven steps.

Either we are getting used to these things or they are much better designed, or possibly both, because this one is easier to use.

Actually, it reminded me a bit of Audi’s MMI system. Touching one of several buttons arrayed around the central controller takes you to a submenu — rotate that central knob to select a function, then push that knob to activate your choice.

This all requires you to take your attention off the driving task — a theme I have pounded on regularly — as the entire concept is inherently flawed.

But we aren’t going back to proper knobs and levers any time soon. At least there has been progress in making these things less dangerous.

Apparently, in the real world, most people only use a handful of the available functions. Once you get used to whichever you want, it becomes second nature.

While I’m whining about the minor controls, I’ll toss in another of my pet peeves. When I tell a car I want the doors unlocked, I want them to stay unlocked. This car relocks them every time the car dips below about 15 km/h, then re-accelerates.

There may be some way to disable this feature, but I couldn’t find it. My own VW did this until my genius mechanic broke the code.

Hey, it’s my car — I want it to react the way I want it to react.

The back seat is huge, and you have the option of a pair of buckets or a three-seat bench.

The rear seat head rests restrict rearward visibility as they typically do, but you can and should fold them down when nobody is sitting back there.

I have owned — and raced — BMWs over the years. Even in their luxury cars, the handling prowess I came to love is still there in the big 7 Series.

It may be buried under a ton of high-techery the market seems to want, but if you can dig below that and/or learn to ignore it, you’ll discover a fine-driving car that honours the company’s long traditions.",[],1542,0.7395179816966989
97,https://www.thestar.com/autos/opinion/2020/04/03/rod-campbell-motorsport-marketing-and-pr-man-extraordinaire-dies-at-88.html,6,car drive rear wheel seat race driver road,98,thestar,"Rod Campbell, motorsport marketing and PR man extraordinaire, dies at 88",'Norris Mcdonald',2020-04-03 00:00:00,"Rod Campbell, the man at the centre of what has to be one of our country’s most spectacular rags-to-riches stories, died with dignity this week in Los Angeles, Calif. He was in his 89th year and leaves behind his wife, Sandra; two daughters, Heather and Alison; and two grandchildren.

Born dirt-poor on the Saskatchewan Prairie to a Methodist preacher father and a stay-at-home mother of five, Campbell built a financial fortune through ambition, determination, self-promotion, talent and an uncanny knack of being in the right place at the right time.

From volunteering, initially, to promote races at Le Circuit-Mont Tremblant north of Montreal, to announcing at the first Formula One race held in Canada at Mosport Park in Ontario, Campbell parlayed friendships with important people he’d met along the way to land public-relations and marketing contracts with Stirling Moss, Jackie Stewart, the Can-Am Series, Formula One drivers George Eaton and Brett Lunger and F1 team owners Walter Wolf and Mo Nunn.

His personal Mount Everest moment of success came when he launched Campbell and Co. to handle motorsport program promotion and event planning for the Ford Motor Co. He sold it in 1999, making him, as he would say, wealthy.

“We were very poor when I was a boy,” he said. “As a result, I was extraordinarily ambitious. I was determined to succeed.”

This ambition and determination gave him the good life, which he loved. Sure, there were failures, but in the end, the good outcomes far outweighed the bad. He travelled the world, staying in the best hotels. He played on the best golf courses, hobnobbed with the captains of industry — Roger Penske, Edsel Ford, et al — ate the finest food and drank the finest wines. In short, he thoroughly enjoyed his success.

He had two marriages — one not so good, the second the best, which gave him the family he adored.

One time, with Sandra, the love of his life, they were driving along the Pacific coast and she casually mentioned she’d like to live in Malibu one day. So, he bought a six-acre lot and built her a mansion, complete with a three-hole golf course (which got him into trouble with environmentalists, who demanded he rip up the greens).

He was respected far and wide and liked by one and all (except maybe those California environmentalists). When word got around that he was ill and would die, the phone started ringing. Bernie Ecclestone was among the first to call. Bernie thanked him for what he’d done for Formula One. There were many others.

He knew everybody — Penske, Walter Hayes, Michael Kranefuss, Pat Patrick, Jack Roush. Former Ford CEO and president Jacques Nasser once told him that if he ever had an idea — and he had a million — all he had to do was call his secretary and he’d have him in his office in an hour.

He was respected for his integrity — people trusted him implicitly — and his internal optimism. It didn’t matter if it was trying to recover money from his F1 friend Wolf or organizing the Santa Claus parade in London, Ont., he was convinced everything would turn out all right.

Er, the Santa parade in London? Yup, it was a great success, that parade in 1959, particularly because Campbell convinced an old roommate, the singer Robert Goulet, to drive over from Toronto to be a celebrity guest.

It was in London that Campbell discovered what would be the secret to his success. “If you agree to do a job, and then do more than expected, you add value,” he once told me. “Added value has worked wonders for me.” And then he told me how it all came about.

He’d been in Europe, serving in the U.S. army (he’d gone to New York to study broadcasting, applied for a green card and, as a result, got drafted) and, once discharged, had gone looking for a job, which was easier said than done. He finally landed one selling ads for a radio station in London, for which he had zero experience. But one of his clients, Ed Leavens, sold sports cars.

“When I was in the service, I’d gone to the German Grand Prix. I was captivated by the sights, the sounds, the bravery of the drivers — I loved everything about it. So when I started selling radio ads to Ed Leavens, I found out he raced the cars he sold. I asked if I could go to the races with him.

“So we were at Harewood Acres and Ed won his race. I had a brainwave. I called the radio station and asked the sports guy if I could do a live hit and I reported that Ed Leavens of Leavens Motors had won the race. So I sold him ads and reported on his races and that was added value. I always tried to do that.”

From London, it was on to Montreal, where he continued to sell ads for radio and immersed himself in the local motorsport community. Once, he chartered an Air Canada plane (then Trans-Canada Airlines) to take 50 people to the Indianapolis 500. He asked Dick Irvin Jr., son of the legendary coach of the Canadiens who was doing sports on the CTV station there, to plug the trip so he could sell the last couple of tickets. Irvin said sure, but asked Campbell to appear on his late-night sportscast to do a report after the plane got back.

It was 1964, the year Dave MacDonald and Eddie Sachs were killed in a second-lap inferno following a crash that involved seven cars. Irvin was so impressed with Campbell’s reporting and on-camera demeanour that, soon after, he offered him a job reading sports on weekends.

In a short period, Campbell had learned the advertising business and was an on-air radio and TV sports personality. He finished his on-the-job journalism training by writing about racing and later editing Canada Track & Traffic magazine. It all stood him in good stead when he went into PR.

Now, I could write a book about Campbell — but that’s already been done. In 2015, Campbell financed his limited-circulation autobiography, “I’m Rod — An Incorrigible Optimist: My life in auto racing and public relations.” He hired award-winning motorsport reporter Pete Lyons to write it and I think it’s terrific. In fact, I thought a good editor could turn his story into a bestseller. I still do. Few people in this world have led the fascinating life that Campbell led, or enjoyed the successes.

Here are some of Campbell’s observations and conclusions about people and business, garnered either from conversations we had (we met for lunch during the Los Angeles Auto Show for years, as well as in Toronto) or from his book:

“Respect was the central focus of my life. I wanted the respect of my family and my peers. As we grow older, we all realize there isn’t a lot to hold (onto) in our senior years except for memories and relationships nurtured in a lifetime of chasing dreams.”

Campbell was thrilled when he was hired to promote Jackie Stewart and his sponsor, L&M cigarettes. It came about after the company was told to “get that Canadian guy to do it.”

“I had made sure he knew my work!” Campbell said of the fellow who’d recommended him. “That’s just part of being ambitious and making sure the right people know. And it still works today.”

His nephew, Jason Campbell, general manager of the Canadian International AutoShow, wrote a letter to his uncle in recent weeks:

“In Grade 11, when I was 16, I had a creative-writing assignment in school, and I remember one of my tasks was to write a short biography on someone of my choosing. Of course, I chose my uncle Rod. I remember sitting down for this formal interview with you. By then, you had built up Campbell and Co. and seemed to be going from strength to strength. I remember asking you the question, ‘What has been the key to your success?’ And I remember very clearly your answer — ‘Confidence! Confidence is critical.’ You’ve always been one to instil that confidence in others — to push the boundaries, to do things not done before and to do them better than anyone else. That lesson in life is one of the greatest you’ve passed on.”

On Eaton, the Canadian department-store heir — the family name is still on the Eaton Centre in downtown Toronto — who raced in the Can-Am Series and Formula One: “George had a lot of natural talent, but he didn’t want to work to develop it. I used to nag him, but he’d say, ‘Nah, I don’t need to test; I can drive fine.’ He really liked the idea of being in the spotlight in a dangerous sport. He liked the badge it gave him. But he really wasn’t serious about racing in itself.”

On Stewart: “I don’t remember races so much as I remember incidents. One big one blew up at the Mid-Ohio track. Jackie was on a safety crusade in those days. I’ll never forget when we got to Mid-Ohio (for a Can-Am race), there was this one giant tree sitting out 50 yards off the first turn. No barricades, no protection, just a big tree sitting there. Jackie starts, ‘What? What is this? It’s got to go.’”

On Wolf: “I have to say, much as I liked Walter, and enjoyed working for him, he was a little loosey-goosey about business. He agreed to pay me pretty well for the time, $120,000 for the year, but getting him to actually pay was another thing. I always had to chase him to collect it and finally he’d wire me something or hand me cash.”

That was in the book — but there was more to it than that. I have copies of several collection notices sent to Wolf on behalf of Campbell (part of the research for a book I’m working on) and I once asked Campbell about them. “It would take awhile,” he said, “but Walter would always come through. Those (collection notices) were more to get his attention. He’s still a good friend.”

On Campbell and Co., and his great friend Len Coates: “Len was a wonderful Canadian writer I’d gotten to know from my reporting and publishing days (Canada Track & Traffic). I wanted him to be an integral part of Campbell and Co., but he wasn’t as disciplined as I’d wanted him to be. He liked to work all night and I wanted him in the office during business hours. He wanted to go back to Toronto (Campbell and Co. was headquartered in Michigan) and I gave him 15 per cent of the company in stock in an effort to get him to stay. But he gave that up and left.”

Campbell and his wife remained personal friends of Coates’s up to his death several years ago. In co-operation with the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame, they then established the Len Coates Awards, three bursaries for young journalists studying at Toronto’s Ryerson University, Coates’s alma mater.

Campbell attended the bursary luncheon at Ryerson last fall and took a moment to talk about his friend, but to also tell those in attendance that the bursaries would be funded in perpetuity but that because of his age, it would likely be his last trip to Toronto.

Ever since I learned he was ill and would die, I’ve wondered whether he had a premonition.

As expected, the tributes have poured in.

Mario Andretti sent out a tweet in answer to one by Campbell’s son-in-law, Townsend Bell, the Indianapolis 500 and sports-car driver: “I’m one of the fortunate to have known him well enough to call him a friend. I’ll miss him.”

Bell himself wrote: “Rod had an amazing 88 years and we are proud that he passed with so much universal love and respect. He died a very happy man. What more can any of us ask for?”

Said Kevin Kennedy, executive vice-president of what is now called Campbell Marketing and Communications: “He taught me so much about the business, including a philosophy of always going above and beyond for the clients and the people we work with.”

Coates’s brother, Bert, wrote: “Rod was a true gentleman and friend throughout the motorsports and automotive worlds. And he shared his abundant energy and intellect in support of many worthy causes.”

And Dr. Hugh Scully, chairman of the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame, wrote: “Rod would call me personally on a regular basis to offer wise counsel as the Hall’s board of directors was restructured and we broadened our scope of inductions to include international and media contributors to motorsport in Canada. As time passes, we will all treasure and share happy memories about Rod as a man, a friend and a genuine builder of motorsport.”

On March 19, less than two weeks ago, Campbell sent me an email with his phone number and asked me to call. I knew he was ill and so I was expecting the worst. But after explaining what his death would entail — essentially an explanation of California law — we settled in to enjoy some reminiscences and we had a few laughs. He told me Stewart had called, as had Sir Jackie’s son, Paul. And others. And we gossiped about our mutual pal, Coates. And then it was over.

Said Campbell to me, Norris McDonald, around 12:30 p.m. Pacific time in Santa Monica, 3:30 p.m. my time in Mississauga:

“OK, I’m outta here. See ya on the other side.”

The eternal optimist was already making plans for his next adventure.

Despite the increase in the number of cases, it is reassuring to see that citizens and businesses are complying with the rules of law and heeding the advice from doctors and health-care professionals.

Amidst this uncertain and fearful time, I am encouraged by the actions that some people and companies are taking to provide additional assistance to those in need.

Most new-car dealerships have reduced their hours of operation and are offering essential service and virtual sales. Some dealers have closed their doors altogether until it is safe to open them again. If you want to know your dealership’s policies and procedures with regard to COVID-19, and how to address your automotive needs, visit their website.

Automotive manufacturers have also posted messages on their websites for their dealer networks and for the public. The message from Pierre Boutin, president and CEO of Volkswagen Canada, I found particularly inspiring in light of all the daily updates.

Boutin writes: “Please follow the recommendations of our health authorities, and do what you can to minimize risk. And remember, finding the time to smile is a powerful tool in moments like these.”

Boutin’s message underscores the importance of everyone doing his/her part in fighting this pandemic, and also remembering that we are all human and need to connect with our families, friends, colleagues and neighbours.

This is a defining time for Canadians. We are all in this crisis together, and together, we will fight it and emerge stronger as a country when it’s over.

Across the province, new-car dealerships are helping their communities by providing vehicles, health supplies and other resources.

The Owasco Group generously offered up to 70 RVs and trailers to the Oshawa and Ajax hospitals to support first responders who need ways to get to home and work. The group has a volunteer team to come in and help with this as soon as the call comes in.

The Drive Muskoka dealerships in Huntsville provided much-needed medical supplies to the Huntsville Hospital Foundation.

During this health crisis, many people may feel that their life has spun out of control, which could lead to anxiety and depression. This could be the result of a lack of structure in their lives — the normal, day-to-day activities that we need to feel fulfilled — as people are wondering what to do with their time.

Here are some suggestions for making the most of your spare time:

If you have health-related questions or are looking for health services, contact Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.

If you have a friend or family member who is feeling down, call them up and try to buoy their spirits. You could put a smile on someone’s face who really needs it. Make use of free online conferencing services, such as Zoom, Skype, FaceTime or Google Hangouts. (It’s the next best thing to being with a person.)

Does the news and information you give your time to daily reflect your lived experience and the concerns of your community?

I wish I did not have to ask these questions. Unfortunately, the reality is that although it is 2019, Canadian media still too often miss the mark in representing the diverse communities we report on and for. Study after study in recent decades tell us that women, Indigenous people and persons of colour are underrepresented both in media coverage and in the newsrooms of our nation.

I am of two minds in telling you that the Star is taking steps within its newsroom to aim to better reflect the diversity of our community. On one hand, I am disheartened that this is still an issue, one I have been following closely for some 30 years; on the other hand, I am encouraged at the seriousness of the Star newsroom’s new efforts to broaden the voices in the news.

A newsroom-wide project we’ve dubbed “Mirrored in Media” launched last month with the goal of increasing the number of women quoted in the Star to 50 per cent — a significant increase from the 25-30 per cent reported through our own and outside tracking. This initiative also aims to increase the number of people of colour quoted in the Star with the goal of establishing a benchmark and creating far greater inclusivity in news coverage.

A newsroom task force of more than a dozen journalists (of which I am part) is working with senior editor Julie Carl, who is leading this initiative at the behest of editor Irene Gentle. Both of these journalists believe passionately in the need for more inclusive coverage of our community and aspire to create a newsroom that mirrors the diverse Canada of 2019.

This is a vital matter of reader trust and engagement. Indeed, one of the eight “indicators of trust” established by the global Trust Project of which the Star is a participant, is a commitment to diverse voices and perspectives.

“If readers see themselves on our pages, they are more likely to trust us and therefore read us,” Carl said in a news release announcing this initiative, which includes ongoing daily tracking of all sources quoted in the work produced by Star journalists and freelancers and all photos published in the Star.

This initiative is part of a global effort launched by an organization called United for News, in connection with the World Economic Forum. Through this project, participating newsrooms around the world have committed to take steps to increase the voices of women in the news to 50 per cent. This has long been a goal of Canada’s own Informed Opinions, a non-profit organization that works with Canadian newsrooms to amplify women’s voices to achieve gender balance in media by 2025. (Full disclosure: I am a member of the board of Informed Opinions.)

In signing on to the United for News challenge to monitor and increase the voices of women in the news, Gentle made clear that that does not go far enough for the Star. In this community, in this newsroom, she insisted, we must make equally strong efforts to increase our inclusion of diverse voices.

I am optimistic the Star might finally achieve some success on these important goals. Across the newsroom, many reporters are now tracking their own sources and looking to databases of diverse sources to help broaden the voices in their news reports. Shari Graydon, founder of Informed Opinions, recently conducted two workshops in the Star’s newsrooms to introduce our journalists to the organization’s “ExpertWomen” database of women across Canada who are prepared to speak to the media about their subjects of expertise.

I have long believed that the everyday decisions and choices of Star journalists made in reporting and presenting stories, opinions, photos and other news and information are the foundation of greater inclusivity in the Star’s coverage. To me, this is the key to success in this critical initiative.

And clearly, many reporters are taking this to heart: “It’s been interesting to track the results — it definitely makes me think about some of the ways I find sources for my own reporting and who I talk to,” said reporter Sherina Harris, who is working with Carl on the daily tracking efforts.

On this day to celebrate Canada, it is indeed well past time that all Canadians can see themselves mirrored in media.",[],745,0.864045141285049

The Digital News Report, an international survey done by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University, provides some good news — and of course, some not-so-good news too — about Canadians and their trust and engagement with the news.

The topline: While Canadians’ overall trust in news has dropped 6 percentage points in the past year, Canadians still rank fifth of 38 countries for media trust, with 52 per cent trusting in Canadian news overall and 59 per cent trusting the news they use.

Across all countries surveyed, the average level of trust in the news in general is down 2 percentage points to 42 per cent and less than half (49 per cent) trust the news media they themselves use. Trust in news reached via social media is lower still both in Canada and overall.

Canadians report a more positive view of our news media and its mission than those in most other countries around the world. A majority of the 2,055 Canadians who participated in the detailed survey conducted Jan. 17-Feb. 18, believe news organizations in Canada keep them up to date, (70 per cent); help them understand the news (60 per cent); and fulfil the journalistic watchdog role of monitoring powerful people (49 per cent).

Further, the report tells us, these positive assessments of the news may well be linked to higher trust in the news.

“Put simply, we find that people are more likely to trust the news if they feel it keeps them up to date with what’s happening, helps them understand it, and holds power to account,” the report tells us.

And, increasingly, Canadians are turning to trusted news brands to counter significant concern about misinformation online. The survey reports that 61 per cent of Canadians are concerned about their ability to sort out what is real and what is fake on the internet. As well, a majority (70 per cent) have taken steps to assure the credibility of their news, by checking information against several trusted sites and declining to share news they believe might be inaccurate.

The bad news: Only 9 per cent of Canadians indicate a willingness to pay for news — even the news they trust. Given the well-documented breakdown in the advertising revenue that traditionally supported serious news, this is a concern for most news organizations, including the Star, that are building their news subscription business to fund trusted public interest journalism.

Of concern also to the news business and to democracies that require informed civic engagement is a stronger trend around the world this year to “news avoidance.” More than half of Canadians say they actively avoid the news at least occasionally and more than a quarter admitted to being “worn out by the amount of news there is these days.”

“People say they avoid the news because it has a negative effect on their mood (58 per cent) or because they feel powerless to change events,” the report states.

This exhaustive report provides considerably more data to dig into, to think deeply about and perhaps, act on. Certainly, the Star newsroom is giving careful consideration to what more it can do to build greater trust with its audience. On trust, this survey ranks the Star ninth of 16 English-language news organizations with four broadcast outlets ranked in the top four.

While the trust scores are all close overall, this middle-of-the pack place is both puzzling and discouraging to me, given the extensive amount of work the Star has done to enhance reader trust. In the past year, the Star has participated in a global trust project that resulted in eight “trust indicators” being incorporated into our website content, including transparent labelling to make clear the difference between news and opinion, and journalism and paid content.

I know the Star takes seriously its commitment to accountability and transparency — the foundation of trustworthy news. Accuracy and fairness are core to our journalistic standards. So, what more can be done to encourage greater audience trust?

That is a serious and important question: I want to know what you think and will share your insights with the newsroom and our trust committee. Please tell us: What do you think would build greater trust in the Star’s digital content?",[],738,0.8273525995397595

On Tuesday, the Toronto Star announced it was formally a member of the Trust Project, a global collaboration between news organizations aimed at fostering greater reader trust.

Over the noon-hour that same day, members of the Star’s trust committee, formed more than a year ago to improve transparency of our journalism, held an “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) on Reddit. (Reddit is a discussion, rating and news aggregation website).

Here we present some edited highlights of the AMA, which saw more than two dozen questions from readers. Responses and questions have been cut for length and clarity. The full text of the AMA can be found on reddit.com.

Q. You set up a paywall on your site. How can you expect people to trust you? — UnoriginallyGeneric

A. Irene Gentle, Editor of the Toronto Star: Research has shown that Canadians are generally unaware of the financial challenges of the media industry ... At one point, advertising helped pay the bills of expensive journalism — and journalism is expensive. But Facebook and Google are taking up about three-quarters of the entire industry’s ad revenue. In other words, American tech giants are reaping the rewards of work done by Canadian media outlets, rather than the outlets actually doing the work. Also, good, responsible journalism is very expensive. It can take a reporter weeks at times to verify a key fact in a story. It looks, to the reader, like a sentence. But that sentence took multiple tools to verify and confirm.

Q. Journo student from St. Clair College here. How can we, as young journos, learn to get the public’s trust again? — cynicalPsionic

A. Diana Zlomislic, Investigative Reporter: As journalists, I think we all need to commit to being fair, impartial, accurate and transparent about our processes. When columnists provide opinion, it’s critical the reader or viewer knows that’s exactly what they’re getting. Diverse voices, even those we disagree with, are critical to free press. But the public needs to know there is a difference between opinion and reporting.

Q. With user commenting being cancelled, how do you know if parts of a story are not leaving out important details that you have overlooked? — GTA705

A. Robin Honderich, Senior Manager of Newsroom Audience Engagement: It’s always possible that a detail was missed in the production of any story. If this is the case, we provide many ways for readers to get in touch with us to let us know. Aside from our ‘contact us’ page, which provides a number of ways to get in touch but is not always easy to find, at the bottom of every article page ... is a Twitter link or email address for that staff member for extremely easy access.

Q. What are your thoughts on the era of the accusation of “fake news” that has become mainstream? Do you feel any news can be “fake” or is it all rooted in some degree of truth? — RationalSocialist

A. Brian Bradley, Digital Producer: I do believe in the big World Wide Web that some information can be “fake,” or at the very least, not corroborated, sourced, etc. The onus is on the news organization to follow practices that demonstrate the news is trusted. Is the story solid for sources, background?Who is the reporter, what have they reported? Is there an error-reporting system?

Q. I think that if you want to elicit trust in the reading public, you first need to hire writers who look like the city. Toronto is a city engulfed with multi cultures, different ethnicities. How many Black, Asian, South American writers do you have on your staff? — tuxman06

A. Angela Mullins, Managing Editor (StarMetro): You make a very good point and one we are incredibly cognizant of in our newsrooms across the country. I was largely responsible for hiring new staff in our Western Canada newsrooms earlier this year as part of the StarMetro expansion and I can assure you there was a tremendous amount of attention paid to diversity in all stripes from gender to ethnicity to race. The reporting and management staff are a microcosm of the cities in which they tell stories.

Q. What actions is the Star Trust taking to stop promoting and legitimizing those who are spreading false information? — kofclubs

A. Kenyon Wallace, Investigative Reporter: In becoming a member of the Trust Project, the Star is agreeing to follow specific disclosure standards about how we do our journalism. The Trust Project calls these standards Trust Indicators, which provide readers with information, such as mission statement, ownership structure, sources of funding, and journalistic standards.",[],771,0.7380423574126206

While I find some consolation in the fact that recent studies tell us that Canadians trust their news more than do news consumers in other parts of the world, the overall data on trust in journalism in Canada and beyond makes clear that serious news organizations such as the Star should not underestimate public skepticism about journalism.

Increasingly, in this time when misinformation can go viral across the internet and that vile f-word epithet (f— news) has been weaponized against journalists and news organizations, those of us who take journalistic responsibility seriously must take steps to show that we are real news.

To that end, the Star announced the good news this week that it is a partner in the Trust Project, a global consortium of news organizations working together to improve trust in journalism.

This project, led by award-winning journalist Sally Lehrman and hosted by Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, aims to foster reader trust by helping to guide digital news audiences to reliable, credible news sources and making it clear to readers when they have found trusted sources amidst the noise and nonsense that can be found across the Internet and especially on social media. The project is funded by Craig Newmark Philanthropies, Google, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Democracy Fund and the Markkula Foundation.

In becoming part of this initiative, the Star joins a group of global news organizations committed to incorporating “Trust Indicators” into all digital content. These indicators are key transparency standards for news and information that help readers recognize the commitments and expertise behind trustworthy journalism.

These include a new “About Us” page that states clearly the Star’s mission, its ownership structure, leadership team and its key ethical standards. You can now find a link to that page on every piece of content on thestar.com — as well as a link to the Star’s journalistic standards guide and a highly visible means to report an error. As the Star’s transparency reporter Kenyon Wallace told you on Tuesday, these indicators also include clear labels to help readers better distinguish between news, opinion, analysis, and sponsored content, as well as biographical details about our reporters that highlight their expertise and backgrounds.

What is trusted news? Across Torstar news organizations, we define trusted news as accurate, accountable and ethically produced. Being accurate means verifying information before sharing it – and correcting mistakes when they happen. Being accountable means being transparent and open about what we do and how we do it. Being ethical means producing news and information according to ethical standards as set out in Torstar’s recently updated Journalistic Standards Guide.

All these measures are key requirements for becoming part of the Trust Project. Its Trust Indicators are well-thought out signals for readers established by international news leaders following consultations with news audiences about what they believe makes journalism trustworthy. As Craig Newmark, one of the project’s funders told the Poynter Institute’s contributing editor David Beard in an interview this week, “News outlets want to make a statement, a credible statement, that they can be trusted. We need a Better Business Bureau, the equivalent of Consumer Reports (for journalism), but the first step is for a news outlet to come out credibly and say, ‘Hey, you can trust us’.”

While the work required to incorporate all of these trust indicators across all the Star’s digital content has been extensive in recent months, I think it also bears stating that the values that provide the foundation for these trust indicators are not new for the Star, a 126-year-old news organization that has put a high value on ethical journalism and accountability to its readers for many decades. For me, that is evidenced by the fact that the Star has had a public editor/ombudsman to respond to reader concerns about accuracy and ethics since 1972.

Still, given the current often nasty environment of online misinformation and mistrust in media throughout the world, it matters much that the Star do all it can to show you its strong commitment to delivering trusted news, information and content on all platforms.",[],703,0.7270476773592798

Torstar Journalistic Standards Guide

Opinion | Public Editor: Readers need to distinguish news from opinion

The Star’s internal trust committee, an ongoing initiative made up of employees across Torstar, has overseen the creation of a dedicated Trust page, a larger glossary of Star news terms, new conventions on story labelling, and a weekly trust feature looking at the various ways the Star does its journalism.

“The Star has long had a very deep commitment to responsible, public service journalism. We have a public editor, independent from the newsroom for people to voice complaints to. We are part of National Newsmedia Council, an independent body that oversees and adjudicates journalism complaints. We have a code of conduct. We have ethical discussions on what we do and how we do it every day, sometimes multiple times a day. We know this but we weren’t telling our story,” said Gentle.

In the global Trust Project, participating media organizations agree to follow certain disclosure standards, known as Trust Indicators, developed by news executives around the world following dozens of interviews with readers that sought to discern what audiences value in news.

The indicators essentially present a variety of information about the publication that readers have said is important, such as ownership structure, executive makeup, mission statement, ethics, sources of funding, and journalistic standards and policies. The indicators also include clear labels to help readers better distinguish between news, opinion, analysis, and sponsored content, as well as biographical details about reporters that highlight their expertise and track records.

Participants also state any commitments to presenting more diverse perspectives, citations and references for published statements of fact, and information about why certain stories were pursued and by what means.

Lehrman likens the Trust Indicators for news to the equivalent of nutrition information.

“It’s like a nutrition label that you would get on a piece of news,” Lerhman said in an interview. “Maybe you care a lot about ethics. Maybe you care a lot about the author’s expertise. Maybe you care a lot about the organization as a whole. So, you will get all these pieces of information and you can make your own decisions about what news you want to trust.”

How does this all translate into what Star readers will experience? For starters, at the bottom of every article published on thestar.com, readers will now find links to three trust-related features: a more visible “Report an Error” button, a link to the Star’s journalistic standards guide and a link to the organization’s “About Us” page.

In recent months, the latter two features have undergone substantial revision overseen by Public Editor Kathy English.

Behind the scenes, the Star’s development team has been working on updating and standardizing internet markup language that will help the Trust Project’s tech partners — Google, Facebook, and Bing, to name just a few — better guide audiences to trusted sources.

At the beginning of this year, as part of the Star’s ongoing transparency project, we published a feature looking at how our newsroom style committee strives to maintain a sensitive, clear and consistent presentation of content.

The article, which delved into the role of the style committee and its decisions on word usage, proved popular with readers. In light of that, we thought it would be fun — and, we hope, of value — to look at the reasoning behind why the Star has made certain style decisions about specific words.

The examples we have chosen for this feature are a sampling of words — some quirky, some contentious — from the Star Stylebook, a newsroom resource providing guidance on everything from spelling, capitalization and punctuation to the use of numbers, measurements and foreign words and phrases.

We sat down with Anthony Collins and Jon Ohayon, co-chairs of the Star’s style committee, to get the goods on who is winning the name game in one Toronto neighbourhood and whatever happened to that reliable staple, the good old hot dog.

Days of blunder: The Canadian Press, the national wire service that publishes a well-respected guide on style, prefers daylight time but Star style is daylight saving time, on the grounds that it’s more commonly used. Many say daylight savings time, but that’s less common than the singular. Daylight time is convenient in headlines, though — a useful fallback(ward) position.

Flipping the bird: Canadian Geographic magazine ruffled some feathers in 2016 when it proclaimed Perisoreus canadensis to be our “new national bird” but spelled its name the American way: gray jay. We knew that wouldn’t fly, so the Star used the Canadian spelling grey jay in our coverage, relying on the Canadian Oxford Dictionary for backup. The species was recently renamed the Canada jay, so patriotic birdwatchers and word watchers can both breathe easy.

To Beach his own: It’s a decades-old debate that may never be resolved: what to call the east-end Toronto neighbourhood by the lake. Many longtime residents insist on the singular form the Beach, but others swear it’s always been the Beaches.

The Beach won out in a 2006 neighbourhood poll and that’s the name that appears on street signs along Queen St. The Star planted its flag in the Beach camp, too, in 2009, when it created a neighbourhood map of Toronto with input from readers. You’ll still see “Beaches” in the Star: in quotes, for instance, or in the name of the federal/provincial riding, Beaches—East York. But when it’s our choice, we prefer the Beach.

Tweet science: Though we capitalize Twitter, we lowercase tweet as both a noun and a verb. In the early days, around 2008-09, our archives show we capitalized tweet quite often, as it seemed exotic.

Stuck on neutral: The Star stylebook advises writers to “use gender-neutral terms such as spokesperson, chair, camera operator, firefighter and letter carrier whenever possible.”

As with any style rule, there are always exceptions: words like actress, freshman and fisherman are still so common that they’re hard to avoid (and don’t get us started on ombudsman, which many insist is gender-neutral). On the other hand, firefighter and flight attendant are so widespread that their gendered antecedents are seldom heard now. In between are phrases like business person and humankind that will sound natural to some readers and drive others up the wall. Preferring gender-neutral terms may lead to accusations of political correctness run amok, but the language is constantly evolving, and what sounds odd or stilted today may soon be common parlance.

Voyage of the God damned: The Canadian Press’s two-word style seems a bit archaic: God damn/God damned. (There’s also a note that it should be used with discretion.) Star style — goddamn — seems much less jarring and less clunky as an adjective, though we also use it with discretion and it mainly appears in quotes. Readers often remind us that God should be capitalized, though in this common phrase, we disagree.

Mike dropped

The Star follows Canadian Press style on the abbreviation for microphone, which used to be mike. In 2015, it was changed to mic. The phenomenon of the mic drop would have looked bizarre in print as mike drop and mike drop is much less prevalent online.

How the sausage is made: CP’s longtime preference for spelling hotdog as one word didn’t pass mustard — er, muster — with some readers. It always looked a little strange to us, too. So we were glad when the CP Caps and Spelling guide recently changed its entry to hot dog — no doubt avoiding many future bunfights.",[],777,0.9417572647704446

Within a few minutes, the trickle became a deluge. To find out more, she immediately called police, EMS and Toronto Fire Services, which told her they had received the first call at 10:04 p.m.

“The gravity of the situation really dawned on me when I heard the urgency in the voice of the paramedic I spoke to. He sounded like he was on the verge of panic, like there was as crisis,” said Roy. She ran over to the Star’s digital desk to alert editors, who instructed her to start writing a short story to be posted on thestar.com.

At the same time, Star photographer Richard Lautens had just returned to his home near the Danforth after a vacation in cottage country, when his two kids, who had gone out for dinner, came running in. They had just seen a string of police cars, sirens blaring, speeding down the Danforth.

Lautens grabbed his camera and started running. A few minutes later, at around 10:10 p.m., he was at Alexander the Great Parkette at the corner of Logan and Danforth Aves., where he saw paramedics administering first aid to two people lying on the ground. “It was just mayhem everywhere,” said Lautens. “Nobody knew what was going on.”

He snapped pictures of bystanders looking on in shock, of police interviewing witnesses and of paramedics loading victims on gurneys into ambulances. Using his phone as an internet hotspot, he quickly emailed the newsroom a couple of photos that could run with the initial story, which went online at 10:51 p.m. It reported that a man dressed in black had opened fire on the Danforth, injuring multiple people.

As the scale of the tragedy started to become clear, news editor Jason Paul, who was overseeing production at the Star that night, began making a plan to get reporters on the ground.

“As more eyewitness accounts came in, we wanted to be sensitive knowing that lives had been lost and others injured. We wanted to help readers understand what was happening but at the same time knowing this was a devastating situation for so many people,” said Paul.

He called breaking news editor Amit Shilton to discuss the unfolding situation. Shilton then started calling reporters who lived in the area of the shooting to see who could get to the scene and interview witnesses.

One of those reporters was David Rider, the Star’s city hall bureau chief, who was out walking his dog when he started hearing sirens and saw a police command vehicle heading north on Carlaw Ave. towards the Danforth. Shortly before midnight, Rider stationed himself outside the police cordon at that intersection and started interviewing people leaving the scene.

Shilton also reached Wendy Gillis, the Star’s crime reporter, who hopped in a cab and rushed to the other end of the cordon at Danforth and Broadview Ave. where she interviewed several witnesses. One of the first people she stopped on the street was an employee of the Second Cup near Chester subway station that had been a target of the gunman. The employee provided a detailed description of the shooter and recounted a shocking story of watching him fire his gun at the shop.

Back in the newsroom, digital producers Tanis Fowler and Priya Ramanujam kept the online news file updated throughout the night and started a liveblog which pulled in tweets from reporters on the scene and Roy in the radio room.

Shortly before 12:30 a.m. Gillis learned — thanks to a timely text message from a colleague — that Police Chief Mark Saunders and Mayor John Tory would be holding a press conference in just a few minutes at Danforth and Logan Aves. Gillis was about a kilometre away so she sprinted as fast as she could, arriving just as the chief and the mayor stepped up to the microphones.

Jenna Moon, the overnight radio room reporter, was also dispatched to the scene to gather colour and interview witnesses. She later met up with Gillis before heading to St. Michael’s Hospital to check on the status of victims.

Columnist Rosie DiManno also went to the scene and spoke to witnesses for a story she filed early that morning.

Sunday night’s front-page editor, Anthony Collins, stayed all night to combine the individual journalists’ reports into a comprehensive story covering as many aspects of the shooting as possible.

“At that point we were really leaning on the reporters to give us whatever kind of colour they could from the scene in order to take the story beyond a shorter police file, to really flesh out what happened,” said Paul, who also stayed at the Star throughout the night. “The goal was to set up a really great package — Rosie’s column and a thorough news story — that was available for readers in the morning.”",[],840,0.891063674903772

This week, we look at how the Star’s wine critic, Carolyn Evans Hammond, responded to reader inquiries about why she reviews American wines in the midst of a trade war with the U.S.

Late last month, the Star’s wine reviewer, Carolyn Evans Hammond, wrote an article in which two of the five wines she recommended were American.

Her review happened to come at a time when the Canada-U.S. trade war was reaching a fever pitch as Canada prepared to slap retaliatory tariffs on imports from its southern neighbours.

Evans Hammond discovered that her recommendations of American wines did not sit well with some readers.

“I generally enjoy your Saturday columns in the Star, but in light of the current state of Canada/U.S. trade relations, I find it curious to find you recommending two out of five wines coming from the U.S. this week,” one reader wrote to her. “Surely, you have heard the gathering talk on boycotting U.S. wine (and many other products) coming from this side of the border in response to the bullying tactics from the U.S. regarding trade tariffs.”

“Surely there are enough great wines in the world that we do not need to promote those from the U.S. at this time. Is it possible for you to discontinue the review of U.S. wines?” asked another.

One reader stated bluntly: “It’s time to stop pushing America wines in your Star column.”

While Evans Hammond says she understands the concerns of these readers, she notes her job is to recommend wines based on value for money, relative to similar wines at that price point. And that means American wines are fair game, regardless of the political climate.

Have your say

“From my perspective, I can’t not include wines because I don’t agree with a political situation going on in a region. That’s a huge kettle of fish,” she said in an interview.

Evans Hammond says if she were to start taking a nationalist stance on her reviews, she would be doing a disservice to wine consumers and producers.

“As a wine columnist, I recommend wines from all over the world based on those that offer the best value for money within the context of a respective column. It is up to individual readers whether they want to buy American wines,” she said.

“What’s important to know is this: fierce global competition in winemaking is constantly pushing quality up and prices down, so it’s a very exciting time to be a wine enthusiast. With that in mind, I try hard to keep abreast of what’s out there and to recommend only the wines I think offer the very best value for money. Then, I give each wine I recommend a score out of 100 and qualify that score with a lengthy tasting note to communicate what makes the wine special.”

The Star’s public editor Kathy English said while the emails Evans Hammond received from readers were not unreasonable given the current trade situation between the U.S. and Canada, she stressed that columnists, including Evans Hammond, are fully within their remit to choose what they write about.

“Columnists have the prerogative and latitude here to select the topics they write about, and in the case of reviewers, to select the products they review,” said English. “There are no policy issues at play here whatsoever.”",[],561,0.9773252449912339

This week, we look at how three Star journalists created a unique multimedia feature around safe spaces in Toronto.

Asian Community AIDS Services, Chinatown. The Drake Hotel, West Queen West. Planned Parenthood, The Annex. The Palm House at Allan Gardens. Glad Day Bookshop in the Village. The 519 LGBTQ2S Community Centre.

Just some of the cherished safe spaces highlighted by 10 people in Toronto’s LGBTQ community interviewed for a multimedia feature by Star journalists Evy Kwong, Kelsey Wilson and Carlos Osorio.

The feature, published late last month just in time for the city’s annual Pride weekend, comprised text, video, audio and photographs to go inside the spaces identified by the interview subjects that give them a sense of sanctuary.

Kwong, a digital producer, says the idea for the project was formed in response to the tragic deaths of several members of Toronto’s LGBTQ community who police believe were murdered by alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur.

“Even though it had seemed that acceptance and inclusivity was progressing for the community, there was reason to feel more unsafe than ever,” Kwong explained in an interview. “We wanted to talk to a spectrum of people on where they felt sanctuary despite the news of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur. Where did these people feel they could be 100 per cent safe?”

With that question in mind, Kwong and colleagues Wilson, a video producer, and photographer Osorio, set out to find 10 people to talk openly about their safe spaces and identities.

It was a challenging task. With just four days before publication, the journalists had to track subjects down, meet them at various locations across the city, shoot video and collect audio, edit and type up interviews.

Kwong began by reaching out to friends in the LGBTQ community, who referred her to people they thought might want to speak about their experiences. She also reached out to more well known figures in the community such as city councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam and Armand Digdoyo, an event producer, who also founded New Ho Queen, a collective highlighting the Asian queer community.

“We were in a rush, but I still wanted to ensure that we had an array of voices, because being LGBTQ is so much more than just the terms in the acronym, and we were blessed to have such enthusiastic response, even on a day’s notice,” Kwong said.

Meanwhile, Wilson and Osorio met with representatives of Pride Toronto to get feedback on the concept and to ensure they were properly representing the LGBTQ community. The response was a thumbs up.

When it came to photography, Osorio says he was aiming for “something bright and very in your face.” But he also wanted to hint at the tragedies faced by the LGBTQ community this year, so he added a dark edge around the frames of his photos to “show that all is still not well and that a bit of a cloud still hangs over this year’s Pride.”

Osorio added that a challenge for him was trying to keep the look of the photographs consistent while being in different locations.

A recurring dilemma the journalists encountered more than once during the course of their interviews was that some of their subjects told them they hadn’t fully “come out” to their families yet.

“Of course, we were immediately concerned about whether telling their stories could create lasting personal damage,” Wilson said. To address this, she says she and her colleagues were fully transparent with their subjects about what would be published.

“We wanted them to feel completely comfortable with their part in the finished product. These people are trusting you with deeply personal stories and you feel obligated to do them justice.”",[],622,0.9563620674965819

The Toronto Star’s running tally of the false claims made by U.S. President Donald Trump — compiled by Washington Bureau Chief Daniel Dale — is consistently among the most-read stories on thestar.com.

Dale’s list of Trump’s mistruths now numbers more than 1,800 since the real-estate tycoon became president.

Inspired by the popularity of Dale’s work, associate editor Lynn McAuley sought a way to assess the truthfulness of claims made by Canadian politicians.

A good place to start, she thought, was question period on Parliament Hill — a 45-minute session on weekdays in which Members of Parliament for Opposition parties pose questions to the governing party (MPs representing the government are also allowed to ask the odd question). Why not fact-check the claims made by Opposition parties in the framing of their questions, as well as the answers provided by the government, in order to get a sense of how honest our elected representatives are in the spotlight?

Each session is recorded in Hansard, the official transcript of Parliament.

Five days of question period in April and May were randomly chosen to be put under the microscope by Ottawa Bureau reporters Bruce Campion-Smith, Alex Ballingall, Alex Boutilier and Tonda MacCharles, along with reporters Brendan Kennedy and Marco Chown Oved in Toronto.

Question period can see upwards of 40 questions, producing some 9,000 words in one 45-minute session. That meant the team had to check about 45,000 words over the five days examined.

“We were helped that there was duplication from day to day as opposition parties hammered away at a particular topic, such as the carbon tax,” said Ottawa Bureau Chief Bruce Campion-Smith.

Every morning, a reporter in Ottawa shared the previous day’s question period transcript in a Google Doc, explained Kennedy. Subjects were divvied up randomly or according to previous experience or interest in a topic. Claims were assessed as true, false, a stretch or a dodge.

“We really sought to be fair in how we labelled questions and answers,” Campion-Smith said. “That meant a lot of research into a particular topic and evaluating the statements by MPs and cabinet ministers.”

To check the validity of MPs’ statements, the reporters consulted government budgets, parliamentary committee reports, statements by ministers and policies. In some cases, the reporters reached out to MPs’ offices to ask for the source of their information, and then sought verification through further research.

“The toughest claims to fact check were the vague or generalized assertions, and anything that was a borderline opinion,” Kennedy said. “If an MP stated an exact number, it was usually pretty easy to determine whether or not it was accurate. But if they said that something was ‘out of control’ or ‘chaotic,’ then it was a little trickier to make an assessment.”

For example, in a preamble to one of her questions on April 30, Conservative MP Michelle Rempel said that social programs across Canada are under “severe strain due to tens of thousands of unplanned immigrants” crossing the border illegally.

To check these claims, Kennedy searched news sources and government reports about social programs strained by an increase in irregular migrants. Only in Quebec, where most of the migrants arrived, and in Toronto, where many of them end up, did he find evidence of a strain on social services. To fortify this, he looked up the statistics for irregular border crossers and found that 93 per cent of the RCMP interceptions at the border since the beginning of 2017 have been in Quebec. In fact, seven provinces had a combined 21 irregular border crossings in all of 2017.

“Clearly, her claim that social programs were under severe strain ‘across Canada’ was false,” Kennedy said.

Overall, the reporters found that outright lies or false claims in question period were uncommon.

“However, that is offset by what we did find and that is the amount of dodges on the government side, the refusal to meaningfully answer a question,” Campion-Smith said. “The opposition parties are not blameless, either. On their side, there are a lot of exaggerations. So, I think people have a right to be cynical about the whole exercise when they say it’s largely driven by partisan motivations. But I think it’s also a very important part of our parliamentary democracy and the principle of holding a government to account.”

In the foreground, a black bicycle lies on its side in the middle of the road, its front wheel and handlebar bent into awkward angles. What looks like a black bag sits beside the bike. In the background, a few metres feet away, a flatbed truck sits motionless. Two police personnel stand nearby.

That’s a description of a photo published in the Toronto Star last week showing the scene on June 12 at the intersection of Bloor and St. George Sts., where Dalia Chako, 58, a grandmother who loved cycling, was hit and killed in a collision with a flatbed truck.

A disturbing image, to be sure, the publication of which was the subject of intense discussions among editors in the newsroom. There were other photos from the scene, all taken by Star photographer Lucas Oleniuk, that were even more graphic in nature that were under consideration. This week, we take a behind-the-scenes look at the factors editors considered when deciding which photo of this tragic event to publish.

Originally, in the afternoon on the day of the collision, the plan was to use a photo of the collision scene that showed a tarp lying beside the crushed bicycle. But that changed when photo assignment editor Tim Finlan flagged that the tarp was in fact covering the body of the victim. So began a discussion in the middle of the newsroom that grew to include more than half a dozen editors about whether the photo was too graphic to publish.

“On one side, we have to be really sensitive about using photos that show victims’ bodies, even if they are completely covered,” said Catherine Wallace, assistant managing editor of news. “It becomes so easy to imagine it could have been my mother or sister or friend who died in the accident. How would I feel if a picture of their body covered by a tarp was in the paper? It’s a question of dignity and respect.”

On the other hand, cycling deaths are a serious issue, one the city has been grappling with for years, Wallace noted.

“When there is a terrible accident like this one, we want people to pay attention. We want people to stop and think and say, ‘this can’t continue, things must change,’” she said. “Sometimes it’s important to be shocked and upset — for a newspaper to shock and upset people — and photographs are one of the best ways of doing that.”

As editors gathered around the photo desk to examine the image closely, they kept coming back to one question: was this the time to shock and upset people?

Oleniuk volunteered to return to the scene in an attempt to capture the gravitas of the situation without the body in frame.

The Star has chosen to publish photos depicting bodies in the past, such as the image of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian refugee who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea in 2015, and the picture of the body of a teenage Haitian girl shot dead by police in 2010. Decisions to publish such images are made on a case-by-case basis.

Ultimately, Wallace and senior news editor Marie Sutherland decided, given the recent nature of the incident and the sensitivities mentioned above, it was not the right time. Instead, Oleniuk’s photo described above and pictured here — without the image of the body — was chosen for publication that day.

The next day, a different photo that showed the tarp over the body was published on thestar.com, with a story looking at the broader issue of cyclist safety on Toronto’s streets.

“The thing about the discussion that was so challenging, and I think the reason so many editors spontaneously joined in, is that there is no right or wrong answer in a situation like this. Both sides were right: It was a terrible personal tragedy, and it was also a symbol of a city-wide danger that we should all be paying more attention to,” Wallace said. “You can’t have hard and fast rules about photo use. You have to be open each time to considering the context. No two situations are ever, ever the same.”",[],699,0.9403637076127308

This week, we look at how the Star handles letters to the editor.

The famous American playwright Arthur Miller once said in 1961, “A good newspaper, I suppose, is a nation talking to itself.”

That’s a viewpoint held by many journalists today. And among the ways newspapers allow nations — or provinces or towns or neighbourhoods — to talk to themselves is through the oldest form of reader engagement: letters to the editor.

Letters to the editor allow readers to weigh in with their opinions, thoughts or reactions concerning any issues or events in the news. In the Toronto Star, reader letters are published at the back of the A section on Sundays and during the week, in the Insight section on Saturdays, and everyday on the Letters page, at thestar.com.

The Star receives about 25 letters per day, on average, that are suitable for publication. Most weekdays, a selection of between five and eight letters are published, while a larger number are printed on Saturdays, often focusing on the week’s biggest stories.

Letters that make it to publication are chosen by editors working with the Star’s editorial board, which works independently from the newsroom, led by editorial page editor Andrew Phillips. In addition to handling letters to the editor, the editorial board is responsible for daily editorials, opinion pieces by guest writers, and editorial cartoons.

“A good letter to the editor is timely, interesting and well-written. It focuses on the issues at hand,” Phillips said in an interview. “It’s also short — letters run from about 50 to 250 words, so a premium is placed on writers who can get to the point very quickly and express a clear view. A touch of humour helps a lot, too.”

A good letter also avoids certain things.

“We don’t like letters that are abusive, that engage in ad hominem attacks on other people, that mischaracterize the arguments of those the writer disagrees with, or are defamatory. We are happy to publish letters that oppose views expressed by Star editorials or columnists, but they must stick to the issues and avoid personal attacks,” said Phillips.

In addition, editors try to publish a representative sample of letters sent in. The Star tends to lean left in its editorial positions and more letters the paper receives are from that perspective than from the right, Phillips notes.

“We look for a range of subjects and views to keep the section lively,” he said.

Social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, have allowed people to express their opinions without the filter of a newspaper editorial board, and this has resulted in a decrease in the number of letters to the editor in recent years. Social media also provides the protection of anonymity, allowing some users to express all manner of thoughts behind a persona that may or may not be real.

That’s why the Star will not publish anonymous letters. In fact, the editorial board asks letter writers to disclose any conflicts of interest or involvement they may have with an issue on which they are weighing in.

“For example, a person writing to oppose a transit plan should disclose that they are president of a community group fighting the plan, if that’s the case,” said Phillips. “We read letters with an eye on this possibility, and if there’s a reason to suspect some kind of involvement by the writer we may query the writer or Google the name to see if anything relevant comes up.”

Crafting a compelling letter to the editor can also take more effort than sounding off on social media, so for those readers who have found their letters printed in the Star, it’s fair to say the editorial board found their comments articulate, thoughtful, or relevant.

“Nowadays readers have many other ways of expressing their views, especially through social media, but the traditional letter to the editor still remains important,” Phillips said. “And we certainly hope that readers will continue to send them in.”",[],670,0.9249980736796289

Ontario election night on June 7 saw the Toronto Star newsroom in full throttle as staff worked to keep readers up-to-date on the latest numbers from the polls preparing articles for thestar.com and two print editions for the next day.

“We wanted to make sure that, digitally on the night and in print the next day, our audience could find the answers to all the questions they were asking — who was winning at the riding and provincial levels and the implications for constituents and for the province,” said the Star’s politics editor Jordan Himelfarb, who oversaw the coordination of election night coverage.

“It required finding a compelling way to present the results as they came in, highlighting the most interesting and consequential races, drawing out the storylines that defined the night and that gave final shape to the campaign, and providing analysis and commentary that put the flood of information in context.”

Reporters were dispatched to be with the leaders of the four main political parties: Queen’s Park reporters Rob Ferguson and Kristin Rushowy were with PC leader Doug Ford in Etobicoke and the NDP’s Andrea Horwath in Hamilton, respectively. On loan to the Queen’s Park team were Wendy Gillis, who was with the Liberals’ Kathleen Wynne in North York, and Tess Kalinowski, who was dispatched to Guelph to cover Green Party leader Mike Schreiner.

At the same time, Queen’s Park Bureau Chief Robert Benzie held down the fort at the Star’s office at the provincial legislature putting everything together for the main news story about the night’s results. Ontario politics columnist Martin Regg Cohn wrote from home.

That was in addition to more than 40 other reporters assigned to cover results in ridings across the GTA, some covering two ridings at the same time.

“What I was looking for was not only the facts, but also context and colour. Elections are obviously profoundly important democratic moments, with far-reaching consequences, but they are also, for both voters and political players, emotional, human things,” said Himelfarb.

For thestar.com, the main feature of the night was a seat counter and a colour-coded map of the province showing which party had taken each riding in real time, fed by data from the Canadian Press.

To keep stories as timely as possible, reporters were asked to file as soon as definitive results for their ridings were available. A team of editors then quickly polished the copy, wrote headlines, added photos, published the stories online and prepared them for print.

In total, more than 50 ridings were covered by the Star and Metroland publications, resulting in 63 articles, including individual riding stories, columns, editorials and a cartoon.

Thursday was Himelfarb’s first election night as politics editor and he admits that the logistical challenges were daunting. But he said his life was made easier by the huge team effort put forward by Star staff.

“Once the polls close and we’re inundated with results, you don’t have time to be daunted. The adrenaline carries you through.”

This week, we look at how Kate Carraway brings people’s stories from the dating scene to life.

There’s something about the Star’s weekly Dating Diaries, which allows contributors to recount their best, worst, and weirdest dates in their own words, that consistently intrigues Toronto Star readers.

The feature that dives into the GTA dating scene, by freelance writer Kate Carraway, is consistently one of the most popular offerings in the Life section of the paper and on thestar.com.

Regular readers of Dating Diaries are unlikely to forget the story recounted by a woman who, after several dates and feeling she was really connecting with a man, received unsolicited photos of an intimate part of his anatomy. Then there was the diary about a woman’s first sleepover. The next morning, while she was putting on her makeup in the bathroom, the guy went and did a number two in full view. This week, Carraway lets readers in on how she gets people to open up about the intimate details of their personal lives.

How did you become a go-to person for readers and their dating experiences?

I pitched Dating Diaries as a way to get the readers’ experiences directly into (now defunct weekly) The Grid and readers really responded. I think the appeal of the column is obvious — it’s provocative, it’s voyeuristic, it’s fun, it’s educational, it’s sad and happy and embarrassing and funny, and really a vehicle for empathy. It also gives diarists an opportunity to share some very personal moments outside of the usual context of their lives, where friends might judge or where they may not have the chance to revel in something amazing or weird that happened.

Can you explain your process for turning what people have told you into first-person narratives written in their voice?

The Diarists all provide an overview of the date, at first just a short one so I can assess it. Often people submit stories about relationships, rather than dates, or almost-but-not-quite dates, or dates in which there’s no emotional turn or surprise or interest, or that serve some kind of agenda. If a date and a diarist seem like a fit, I ask for the full story, and then I dig in. The asides they might not have thought of as interesting often become the most revealing elements of the Diary. It’s the most fun kind of excavation, for me. I just keep asking questions and clarifying the details, emotional logic, and the tick-tock of the date until it’s tightly packed into the Dating Diaries form. It needs to be cogent, but it needs to maintain the diarist’s voice and experience. Sometimes it’s easy and sometimes it’s excruciating.

How do you find the people you write about?

Usually, people come to me via datingdiariescontact@gmail.com. It’s really not hard to find great Diarists. Usually they are readers of the column already. Often Star readers and former daters recommend the column to friends who have had an especially interesting date. If I meet someone in real life who has a crazy story I always ask them to do a Diary for me. I love talking about my work so a lot of Diaries have come from my extended network, too.

Have you experienced any backlash, and if so, how did you deal with it?

There are definitely certain themes in the Diaries that emerge again and again. I hear a lot about what kinds of dating mistakes men and women make that are thought to be demonstrated by the column. I hear a lot from older people about how dating was different when they were young, and from people who are just now dating after a divorce, or later in life, and find online dating to be difficult to navigate. A lot of people don’t like it when the “rating” that the Dater has given their date doesn’t seem to match their experience.

Why do you think these kinds of stories resonate with people?

I think people are almost desperate for reality, or what the late Tom Wolfe called “status life:” the daily, quotidian details of our existence. Not the kind of shock-value content that is all over the internet and media, but genuine and honest real life. It’s becoming popular to talk about the value of vulnerability, and I think people are understanding that more and more, but in a practical sense it’s still risky to be truly vulnerable, socially and professionally and in relationships and maybe especially in dating.

Ultimately, what do you want people to take away from Dating Diaries?

I want people to feel like they’ve engaged with someone else’s life in a real and intimate way.

This week, we look at how the Star is making its political endorsements more transparent.

It’s provincial election season in Ontario, and that means the editorial boards of newspapers across the province are studying the platforms of each party and keeping a close eye on their leaders in order to determine which candidate to endorse.

Political endorsements by newspapers, including the Star, are a long tradition in journalism, dating back more than a century.

Historically, the Star’s political endorsements have generally leaned left, in keeping with the newspaper’s alignment with the Atkinson principles, a set of progressive values named for former legendary publisher Joseph E. Atkinson. In the previous 14 federal elections between 1968 and 2015, for example, the Star endorsed the Liberals 10 times, the NDP twice and the Progressive Conservatives twice.

The Star’s editorial board, which operates independently from the newsroom, determines which party and candidate to endorse, but not without much scrutiny of the parties’ policies, vision, and the actions and temperament of their leaders.

“It’s part of our role to encourage debate and take a stand on the issues that matter to the community. We’re constantly giving our opinion on everything from subways to trade, so to remain silent on such a big choice as who should lead the province would be odd,” said editorial page editor Andrew Phillips.

He stressed, however, that a position taken by the editorial board doesn’t influence news coverage and an endorsement isn’t “telling” readers who to vote for.

“We’re just sharing our opinion as citizens and making an argument for that choice.”

That’s where editorial board meetings with the candidates come into play. Every election season, the Star invites the leaders of all the major parties to come to One Yonge St. and sit down with members of the editorial board, as well as journalists and editors from across departments. So far during this provincial election campaign, Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner and NDP Leader Andrea Horwath have met with the board. PC Leader Doug Ford and Liberal Leader Kathleen Wynne have been invited. Wynne will be here May 28 at 1 p.m. Email questions to electionquestions@thestar.ca.

The idea is to see how the leaders react to tough questioning and how they defend their positions.

“Leaders who rely too much on canned talking points don’t come across as very impressive,” said Phillips. “You want to see someone actively considering the arguments and responding intelligently when their positions are challenged. Leaders are going to have to deal with unexpected situations, and having a dozen journalists quiz you on your positions is a pretty good test of how well they’re going to be able to handle that.”

This year, the Star decided to increase transparency by live streaming these meetings on thestar.com. Readers are encouraged to send in questions, which the editorial board poses to the candidates.

For the editorial board meeting with Horwath, which took place last Wednesday over the noon hour, readers sent in more than 100 questions. Many questions covered the similar subjects, so the editorial board chose a few to represent readers’ main concerns.

“The live stream gives readers an opportunity to engage with whatever the politician is saying, and to respond, comment or ask more questions in real-time. The idea is to help readers feel they are involved in the conversation,” said the Star’s social media editor Evelyn Kwong, who relays reader questions to the editorial board.

Phillips notes that the live stream also invites readers into a key part of the way the Star’s editorial board examines the choices in the election campaign.

“Readers often wonder how we go about making up our minds on which party to support at the end of a campaign, and live streaming opens the doors on one of the main tools we use to decide — direct access to the party leaders,” he said.

This week, we look at how Morgan Campbell approaches stories for his Sports Prism series.

A few weeks ago, sports reporter Morgan Campbell received a direct message through Twitter from a publicist representing Canadian boxer Adonis Stevenson. How would Campbell like a sit-down interview with the light-heavyweight world champion?

It was a chance to gain some insight into what was going on in Stevenson’s head before his high-profile bout against Badou Jack to defend his WBC light-heavyweight title at the Air Canada Centre on May 19.

The publicist hinted that the interview might touch on Stevenson’s past, so Campbell wanted to make clear that he would explore it. “Sounds like Adonis’ team has come to grips with the fact that at some point, people are going to write about the pimping and the jail time,” he wrote back.

When Stevenson was a teenager growing up in Montreal, he was a member of a gang that ran prostitutes and forced them to hand over their money. Gang members were eventually caught, and Stevenson went to prison for 18 months. While Quebec media have reported on Stevenson’s history with the law, it is lesser-known in Toronto.

The publicist agreed to set up the interview.

Campbell immediately thought the interview could be a good jumping-off point for a feature as part of his Sports Prism project, a weekly series on thestar.com and in the Toronto Star that explores the intersection of sports and other areas of society, such as health, race, science, and business. The idea is to use sports as a prism through which to view societal issues.

Topics covered since the series launched seven weeks ago include how African-Americans make up a small percentage of Major League Baseball players, how a new Canadian minor-league basketball circuit is attempting to develop a lucrative following, and how former NFL legend Eddie George sees the NCAA business model ripe for a makeover.

“For whatever reason, so many of us are addicted to sports. If that’s the starting point, I just look for ways to take advantage of that to tell a different kind of story,” said Campbell, who has been a full-time reporter at the Star for 14 years. “Sports are a good way to view these issues for the same reason that they put vitamins in gummy forms: it tastes better.”

For the story on Stevenson, Campbell felt the boxer’s past presented an opportunity to not only look at how Stevenson had changed his life, but also the lasting harm of misogyny and prostitution.

“The last thing we need in sports writing is another story about the redemption of a troubled athlete and how he’s redeemed because he’s good at sports. There are a lot of those stories and they’re not always true,” Campbell said, noting that in Stevenson’s case, the boxer had to undergo a lot of personal change before he could put himself in a position to excel in sports.

The challenge with this story, Campbell explained, was to address Stevenson’s past so as not to make it seem like his convictions were recent, while also being sensitive to the victims of these crimes.

“Prostitution is still here, and there are people who get out of the industry, but there is lasting harm,” he said.

That’s why Campbell reached out to advocates for sex workers and to shelter staff who could speak about the challenges of recovering from the trauma inflicted by pimps and gangs.

“You can talk about Stevenson’s personal evolution, but you also have to respect the fact that there were victims involved and they have scars from that time in their lives as well. I can’t tell one side of the story without the other,” he said. “To do it any other way does a disservice to everyone involved in the story, including Adonis Stevenson, and a disservice to the truth.”

On that score, Campbell views his role as a messenger whose job it is to convey full, unvarnished stories about people and issues impacting society.

“The best thing to do with unflattering news is to meet it head on,” he said. “If I write a puff piece about Stevenson, all I’ve done is sugar-coated some really unsavoury stuff about him, and kind of erected myself as a barrier between the audience’s understanding of who this person is, where he’s coming from, and what he is now.”

This week, we look at how Debra Yeo approaches her coverage of reality TV.

“If it bleeds, it leads” is a common expression in journalism credited to journalist Eric Pooley, who wrote the phrase in a 1989 New York Magazine piece entitled “Grins, Gore and Videotape — The Trouble with Local TV News.”

There’s no doubt that “bad” news often features prominently in coverage, and has done so throughout the history of journalism. But it’s also the case that not all news is bad news. Besides informing and educating readers, news can, and should, entertain. Editors at the Star make a deliberate attempt to balance the bad news with content that is lighthearted, fun, and entertaining.

Case in point: deputy entertainment editor Debra Yeo’s coverage of reality TV. Since 2004, Yeo has been bringing readers news, previews and opinions about wildly popular reality shows, such as The Voice, So You Think You Can Dance, and Survivor, among others. These days, she focuses on The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise as well as The Amazing Race Canada.

This week, we sat down with Yeo to find out how she brings a critical eye to the genre.

How do you view your role in covering these types of TV shows?

When it comes to The Bachelor franchise, in particular, I usually say I have a love-hate relationship with the shows. I am both a fan and a critic. When I recap episodes, I am reporting what happened but in a sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek way.

What do you say to critics who might view reality shows as something unworthy of coverage in a serious newspaper?

I say that they don’t have to watch the shows or read what I write. I know reality shows can be silly, but in my 33 years of practising journalism, I have had more response from readers about my Bachelor stories than anything else I have ever written. Reality shows can touch us in a genuinely emotional place. I have cried watching Bachelor proposals and Amazing Race eliminations, or performances on shows like American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance. These shows also sometimes confront real-world issues. Think about Rachel Lindsay being the first Black Bachelorette a couple of seasons ago, or the scandal on Bachelor in Paradise when a sexual encounter between two contestants got out of hand. The woman involved said she couldn’t remember any of it because she was blacked out on booze and prescription drugs. That raised the issue of consent since the woman involved said she couldn’t remember any of it, although I don’t think Warner Bros. dealt with it as thoroughly as they should have.

Reality TV is known for its sometimes-torqued drama, contrived social situations, and high emotion. How do these factors influence the way you cover shows?

That is where the love-hate relationship comes in. Take the most recent season of The Bachelor, for instance, in which ABC claimed to show unedited footage of Arie Luyendyk Jr. dumping his fiancée, Becca Kufrin. I found it cruel that the producers allowed Kufrin to be blindsided on camera and wrote about that.

What do you do to ensure you don't lose your sensitivity when covering these shows and the contestants, who, after all, are only human?

Every once in a while I have to step back and remind myself that even though the shows are formulaic and heavily produced, there are real people and emotions at play. Sure, some of the contestants sign up to get famous, but others are just ordinary men and women who want to find a wife or husband. The most powerful reminder of that was when I interviewed Brittany M., the “villain” on the most recent season of Bachelor Canada. I asked her why she hadn’t fought harder to clear her name with Bachelor Chris Leroux after the other contestants accused her of being mean to them, and she started to cry. In her real life, she prides herself on helping empower other women, so it really hurt her feelings that the other contestants thought she was out to get them. It was a reminder that, yes, make fun of the silly things people do and say on the shows, but try not to attack them as people.

You have a no-spoiler rule. How does this align with the Star’s desire to be transparent?

I try to come at these shows from the perspective of being just another viewer who happens to write about them. If I already know what happened, I won’t be writing the recaps from an honest place. There are instances where I do get advance knowledge, like when I attended a Women Tell All episode taping in Toronto, but even if I hadn’t signed a non-disclosure agreement, I wouldn’t have wanted to spoil the episode for other viewers. The same goes for the day I just spent shadowing The Amazing Race Canada.",[],829,0.9189125143811258

It’s a way to bring readers a more fullsome picture of the trajectory and drama of a case that daily reportage of a trial often does not allow.

In order to do this, reporters need access not only to the players — police, lawyers and relatives of victims and the accused — who can provide a human angle, but also to court records that clearly lay the case out, such as the application record (essentially a massive collection of evidence), exhibits from the preliminary hearing that didn’t come out at trial, and Information to Obtain a search warrant, if used by police.

Despite the open court principle — the idea that Canadian courts are presumptively open to the public — reporters often are forced to file an application before a judge in order to access what are already public documents. Star lawyers believe the proper interpretation of common-law suggests these documents should be made available to the public when requested, without having to take the onerous, time-consuming and expensive step of going before a judge.

But that’s just what reporter Amy Dempsey had to do recently while reporting on the disturbing story of the death of an entire Mississauga family — Bill Harrison, his wife Bridget Harrison, and their son, Caleb.

Mississauga mom and her spouse found guilty of first-degree murder in killing of ex-husband

“I have no law degree, no legal training, but the Star cannot afford to hire a lawyer every single time we are denied documents — it is too common and too expensive,” she said.

Back in August 2013, Dempsey was assigned to write a weekend feature about the unusual and disturbing coincidence that all three members of the Harrison family had been found dead in the same Mississauga home between 2009 and 2013.

Up until Caleb’s death in the summer of 2013, neither Bill’s nor Bridget’s death had been ruled a homicide. But that changed shortly after police found evidence that suggested Caleb, a 40-year-old father of two, had been murdered.

For her first story, Dempsey told the story of the Harrison family’s custody battle with Melissa Merritt, Caleb’s ex-wife, and a series of unfortunate events that had befallen the family. That first story in 2013 had the headline, “Three deaths, one home, and a mystery — what happened to the Harrisons?”

Merritt and her common-law partner, Christopher Fattore, were later charged in all three deaths (though Merritt was not committed to stand trial on Bill’s death, while Fattore was committed to stand trial in all three.)

“If the allegations proved true, it meant that police, coroners and pathologists had somehow missed two homicides. How did that happen?” asked Dempsey. She was determined to find out. “This was more than a whodunit. It was a story of mistakes made by the authorities meant to protect us, and two potentially avoidable deaths.”

At the conclusion of the trial earlier this year, Fattore was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Caleb and Bridget. He was found not guilty in Bill’s death. Merritt was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Caleb. A mistrial was declared on her charge in Bridget’s death after the jury could not reach a verdict. Both are appealing the guilty verdicts.

After the trial, Dempsey began work on what would become an 8,000-word feature called “Improbable Cause” published last month, that uncovered disturbing mistakes made by police, coroners and pathologists during their investigations into the deaths.

In order to tell the story fully, Dempsey needed access to records filed in court. But getting the records, which are public, would prove a challenge. First, she had to file an application in Brampton court and had to serve all interested parties — the court, the Crown, Merritt’s defence, Fattore’s defence, and a third party she can’t name due to a publication ban.

Then, once everyone had been served, Dempsey had to appear before a judge four times over a period of several weeks to make legal arguments before a decision was made.

Among the documents she found was a full transcript of Caleb Harrison’s 2010 police interview that took place hours after his mother’s body was discovered (the jury was presented with a significantly redacted version). The full transcript proved that the Harrison family had expressed concern about Merritt and Fattore from the day Bridget was killed. “I would ask where Melissa and Chris were, personally,” Caleb told the officer.

The documents also confirmed that no homicide detectives had investigated Bridget’s death, a fact that was only hinted at during trial.

The revelation of these and other details were only possible because Dempsey went to court — a step journalists might increasingly have to take.

“As financial challenges continue to confront media organizations, it’s important that more journalists go to court on their own, as Dempsey did, to argue for the release of records that serve the public interest,” said Bert Bruser, the Star’s newsroom lawyer.

It was 1:30 p.m. and reporter Jenna Moon was monitoring the Toronto police twitter account. As soon as she saw the tweet, she says, she knew this was big and immediately ran to alert her supervisor, Ed Tubb, an assignment editor on the Star’s breaking news team.

Tubb asked Moon to write a short article with what little information she had. While she did that, Patrick Ho, the rewrite editor on the digital team, began monitoring breaking news channels for the latest information, while the Star’s team of web editors prepared to push breaking news alerts on all of the Star’s digital platforms.

“They were all on the story within 30 seconds of seeing that tweet — there was a lot of controlled yelling in the newsroom,” recalled Tubb.

Moon’s first story on the incident explaining that police said there were between eight and 10 pedestrians struck by a white van was posted online at 1:41 p.m.

Tubb, fellow assignment editor Amber Shortt and their manager, breaking news/enterprise editor Amit Shilton, dispatched reporters Victoria Gibson and Tamar Harris to the scene.

“It’s tough in the first hour, when we don’t know yet know the extent of what’s happened. The first thing is to get reporters on the scene fast,” said Tubb.

In addition to those in the Star newsroom, Metroland and StarMetro reporters responded. Metroland’s Andrew Palamarchuk and Aaron D’Andrea, were among the first reporters on scene. One shaken witness who said he briefly followed the van told Palamarchuk: “This is not an accident.”

“You look back now and yes, it’s pretty obvious,” said Patrick Ho, who kept the breaking news story up-to-date online Monday. “But amid the first minutes of a developing story, we need to make sure. For all we know, without verification, it could have been a case of medical distress.”

At the south end of the 2.2-kilometre stretch of Yonge that had been cordoned off by police, Gibson and Harris interviewed witnesses and police officers, sending their files back to the Star and posting what they were learning on social media.

Star reporters Jesse McLean and Moira Welsh also went to the scene, walking south from Finch on sidestreets and behind buildings on Yonge, interviewing witnesses who were in shops and restaurants when the rampage began. Welsh spoke to a woman who worked in a restaurant close to Finch who gave her an account of a young woman lying on the sidewalk with two men performing CPR on her.

Star photographers René Johnston, Steve Russell and Lucas Oleniuk were dispatched to different areas of the scene. In Johnston’s case, he rushed to Yonge and Sheppard from another assignment at High Park. Coincidentally, Johnston knew that area of North York well because his grandfather used to live close by. Johnston raced on foot toward North York City Centre, which is just north of Mel Lastman Square, where according to initial reports several people had been hit. Sadly, this proved to be true.

Yonge St. had been closed to traffic, so to get close, Johnston entered the area from the west via Beecroft Road, which runs parallel to Yonge, and ran east to the Starbucks on the northeast corner of the square. From there, at 2:23 p.m., he snapped a photo of firefighters and police placing an orange tarp over the body of a victim. A single shoe and some items of clothing rest in the foreground. The picture ran as main art on the front page the next day.

Kathy English, the Star’s public editor, said that it is imperative the Star gets it right, even when news is breaking fast.

“In any breaking news situation, so much misinformation circulates,” English said. “There was a lot of speculation about terrorism. These are the kinds of situations where we have the opportunity to show the role of real news. We take that responsibility very seriously — giving readers facts, not rumours.”

As the team on the scene scrambled for information, the digital desk was in overdrive looking for photos on social media and keeping thestar.com and other platforms up-to-date. It was a difficult task given the abundance of unconfirmed information being reported on social media, and the fact that the number of dead and injured kept changing.

“We did our best to comb through social media, particularly Twitter to find photos we could use but that proved difficult,” said deputy digital editor Sabrina Melchiori. “An abundance of caution was necessary to avoid the spread of misinformation.”

About 5:30 p.m., CBS News reported that sources had identified the suspect in the rampage as Alek Minassian, 25, of Richmond Hill. As soon as she heard this, the Star’s social media producer, Evelyn Kwong, searched LinkedIn, found a profile she thought could be Minassian’s and saved his photo.

“We had a LinkedIn account with a guy that said he went to Seneca, but we didn’t have anybody who knew him who could confirm that his photo is him. That was the problem. We had both these things but no independent confirmation linking the two,” explained Shilton.

Reporter Harris was dispatched to Richmond Hill to see if she could locate Minassian’s home in an effort to confirm his identity. Meanwhile, crime reporter Wendy Gillis worked sources to confirm what the CBS network in the U.S. was reporting and that the photo from LinkedIn was in fact Minassian. Once it was confirmed, a breaking news alert email at 7:48 p.m. told Star readers that a police source had identified the suspect as Minassian.

This week, we look at how the Star covers breaking weather news.

Taped to the glass about halfway up a window in the Star’s radio room is a memo titled, “How to write a weather story.”

It’s a handy guide the Star’s radio room reporters turn to whenever apocalyptic weather hits the GTA, like last weekend when our surroundings became something that looked more like a scene from the Disney movie Frozen than crocus season. The guide, written by one of the Star’s digital producers Natasha Grzincic, lays out who to call in the event of bad weather, what websites and social media accounts to monitor, and when to update the story for the website. It also contains some general suggestions about writing style (conversational! It’s the weather after all!).

“The idea is to write about how the weather affects people, while making sure we are providing them with information that is accurate and up to date,” said Grzincic, who was in charge of thestar.com on Sunday.

The job of reporters who work in the radio room is to keep readers up-to-date on breaking news, including traffic problems, public transit delays or flight cancellations. Weather conditions can play a role in how the city runs, so it’s imperative Star reporters get information fast and get it right. The ice storm of April 14 and 15 provides an opportunity to take a look at how we do that.

It started on Saturday morning, before the real deluge of freezing rain and gusting winds arrived. Weekend staff reporters Tamar Harris and Ben Spurr were assigned the task of updating an existing Canadian Press wire story published on thestar.com that forecast the inclement weather. Harris checked with Environment Canada, which was warning that the ice storm could be “historic” in some parts of southern Ontario, and surveyed the websites and Twitter feeds of GTA universities and colleges to check for closures.

Spurr then updated the story with information the TTC had released about service changes as a result of the storm, and called Toronto Police and the Ontario Provincial Police for the latest updates on the number of collisions in the city. He reached out to Toronto Raptors owner Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment to confirm rumours that the tailgate party in Maple Leaf Square, also known as “Jurassic Park,” for that evening’s playoff game, would be cancelled.

Meanwhile, Star photographers Andrew Francis Wallace and Bernard Weil filed photos showing the effects of the storm.

At 4 p.m., radio room reporter Alexandra Jones arrived for her shift, and immediately checked Environment Canada’s website to get an up-to-date forecast, and continued to check road conditions with police.

“At the start of my shift on Saturday, there had been over 200 collisions reported by the OPP. By the end of my shift, there were over 550,” she recalled.

When she finished work at midnight, Jones passed the file to radio room reporter Bryann Aguilar, who was working the overnight shift. Early Sunday morning, his updated story, which included warnings that freezing rain and heavy rain were headed Toronto’s way, was published online.

At around 9:30 a.m. Sunday, Annie Arnone, the morning radio room reporter, updated the story to include comments from a Toronto Police spokeswoman who urged the public to stay indoors if possible and to drive slowly if going out.

At 10:45 a.m., Mayor John Tory held a media briefing, during which he explained that many streets had not been plowed because of concerns that large amounts of slush on the sides of roads would increase the risk of flooding. This necessitated another update, with the mayor’s comments leading the story.

“I think I updated the same file six or seven times in one shift, which is crazy,” said Arnone.

During the day, photographers Weil and Rene Johnston braved the outdoors trying to capture numerous photos.

At 4 p.m., radio room reporter Alanna Rizza, arrived for her shift, and immediately started working on a round-up of the effects of the storm, including the number of vehicle collisions, TTC delays, flight cancellations and power outages.

“A challenge was that the number of people affected by the ice storm kept changing. Initially, we reported that about 7,000 customers in Toronto were without power, but that number kept growing throughout the evening,” Rizza said.

To keep on top of the power outages, Rizza monitored Toronto Hydro’s website, which provides regular updates through a map.

Barry Brimbecom, the assignment editor over the weekend, said the key to good weather coverage is ensuring readers have all the necessary information to plan their lives.

“We need to tell readers where the streetcar tracks are frozen, if their flight might be cancelled, or where the highways are closed,” he said. “We can help keep people safe, too. When the police are telling anyone who can that they should stay home, I want to know that — and the Star provides that link between them and our readers.”

This week, we look at how one Star reporter looking for an Ontario court file found roadblocks every where she turned.

Reporters who cover Ontario’s justice system have long lamented the lack of transparency they can encounter while navigating the courts.

Courts are supposed to be open to the public — and that includes bail hearings, trials and appeals, as well as records filed in cases. (While the courts are presumptively open, there are certain aspects of procedures that are subject to publication bans, it should be noted).

But whether it’s obtaining copies of documents, exhibits, or transcripts, the reporter’s job of keeping the public apprised of what goes on in our courtrooms can be a challenging, and often frustrating, task.

Case in point: reporter Tamar Harris’s recent trip to the Oshawa courthouse to cover the court appearance of two Durham Regional Police Service officers facing assault charges.

Cst. James Edward Scholtes and Cst. Thomas Broadfoot were each charged with assault causing bodily harm, obstruction of justice and obstructing a peace officer after they pulled over a vehicle in Oshawa on April 26, 2017. According to the Special Investigations Unit, an arm’s length agency which is called in to investigate reports of police involvement in deaths, serious injury or allegations of sexual assault, the officers arrested the 35-year-old passenger and took him to the police station. A short time later, the man was taken to hospital by ambulance suffering a serious injury.

Harris was dispatched to the Oshawa courthouse on March 22, 2018, when the lawyer for the officers was making a court appearance, in an effort to learn the name of the alleged victim (the SIU doesn’t typically release victims’ names).

Harris arrived at 9:30 a.m. and went straight to the courtroom to wait for the officers’ appearance. She was also hoping to see the court file in order to find out the name of the alleged victim. The case came before the judge two hours later, at 11:30 a.m., but went on recess shortly after. After the recess, Harris approached the court clerk and requested to see the file. The clerk said she’d have to wait until the next recess, as there wasn’t time to allow her to see the file.

Harris returned to her seat and waited through the next block of appearances by others charged with various offences unrelated to the police officers’ case. After these cases were heard, Harris again approached the clerk to ask to see the file, but was told she would have leave the courtroom immediately because the court was going on recess again. At this point, Harris had been at the courthouse for more than three hours.

“It’s essential to have the file on hand when writing the story,” Harris said in an interview. “Having that file means you have all the official information and can, perhaps most importantly, fact-check properly. Making sure we get a story right is the most important part of doing our job as journalists, and having that documentation is key to that.”

When the courtroom opened back up an hour later, Harris approached the clerk again with a request to see the file. This time, the clerk allowed her to see it, but only for about three minutes, as the judge was returning any moment. Luckily, that gave her just enough time to find the alleged victim’s name, but nothing else. She was told she would have to wait until the file was returned to the file room at the end of the day before she could get a paper copy.

Harris spent the next hour doing research and pulling files on other cases while she waited for the police officers’ file to be delivered to the file room. At around 4:30 p.m. she started to get worried, knowing that the file room closed half an hour later and the file still hadn’t been returned. At 5 p.m., the file room closed, and Harris wasn’t able to get a copy.

“I don’t think we should accept a system where a journalist can spend eight hours in a courthouse and not get a copy of the file they went there for,” Harris said. “In the end, it is detrimental to freedom of information if a public document is not publicly accessible.”

Brian Gray, a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Attorney General, said the duties for court staff when Harris was there “were particularly lengthy that day as there were hundreds of matters addressed in the relevant courtroom.”

He said it was “unfortunate” that the file had not yet been returned to the administration office before it closed but that it was open for the reporter “to return to the court, or send a representative, to obtain a copy of the file the following morning.”",[],805,0.9419229696375705

This week, we look at how the Star covered the recent Ontario budget while cut off from the outside world.

Readers will often come across the word “lockup” in media coverage of provincial and federal budgets, but it’s a term that is rarely explained.

In essence, a budget lockup is the government’s way of providing journalists with details in advance of the document becoming public when the Minister of Finance speaks to the House later that day, usually around 4 p.m. The idea is to give journalists time to review the budget, ask questions of bureaucrats, and write their stories before the embargo is lifted.

But here’s the catch. Because budgets contain information that could influence the financial markets, at least in theory, no details can be made public until after the markets close. That means no communication with people outside once the lockup begins.

This week we sat down with Queen’s Park Bureau Chief Robert Benzie to find out what it’s like inside the lockup and how journalists deal with the challenges of reporting on the budget’s contents — which impact all Ontarians — without the benefit of contact with the outside world.

This year’s budget document is over 300 pages. Given the huge amount of information it contains, how do you choose which aspects will be most relevant to readers?

While we have a budget sked before we enter the lockup, it evolves during the day. The Star’s Queen’s Park Bureau as well as beat reporters, editorial writers, and columnists are also part of our contingent. We annually enlist the assistance of a Scotiabank economist who helps us in deciphering the sometimes impenetrable numbers in the massive document. The first thing I do every year is read the finance minister’s speech to the Legislature, where we glean the themes of the budget. I bring my noise-cancelling headphones and a playlist of jazz pianist Bill Evans and repair to a quiet corner to read it closely. I am looking both for information and compelling quotes for the main budget story. That’s the overview of our coverage and contains elements that will be explored more deeply in the various sidebars. If it’s interesting enough to be noteworthy to each other it’s probably going to be useful information for Star readers.

Are there any budget lockups that were particularly memorable for you in your nearly 18 years of covering provincial politics?

Probably the most eventful budget of the approximately 30 federal and provincial lockups I have been at was in May 2014. There was a minority Liberal government at the time so Premier Kathleen Wynne needed support from either Tim Hudak’s Progressive Conservatives or Andrea Horwath’s New Democrats. While we knew the Conservatives would not back the Liberals’ fiscal plan, the NDP had propped up the minority Liberals in the 2012 and 2013 budgets. But in 2014, we learned — after getting into the lockup — that Horwath was skipping the traditional opposition leaders’ press conferences because the New Democrats were going to vote against the budget. That meant we were having an election. Luckily, our colleagues who had not yet entered the lockup knew this so that message could get to the Star newsroom. But we were marooned all day in an essentially meaningless lockup knowing we were being plunged into an election.

Given that you are forbidden to talk to anyone outside the lockup, can you give us a sense of how it works and who you can talk to?

We have the entire day to study the budget and have press conferences with the finance minister and the opposition leaders in the lockup. That is for the stories we publish when the embargo is lifted after the minister rises to address the Legislature. There are no phones allowed in the lockup so we are cut off from the outside world. We can query Ministry of Finance bureaucrats about aspects of the budget, but only on a not-for-attribution basis. All political questions are directed to politicians. They turn on the Wi-Fi at 4 p.m. so we can file our stories, but until then we are in an Internet-free Twilight Zone.

What’s it like in there? Is it utter chaos? Coffee cups everywhere? Do you talk to other media or does everyone keep to themselves?

There are around 150 journalists from nearly every major newspaper, wire service, TV network, radio station, and online outlet in the province. Each news organization has its own assigned table with its logo on it, equipped with electrical power bars and microphones for the press conferences. All of the budget documents and news releases are placed on your chair before you arrive at 8 a.m. It’s a very social place — it can be like old home week catching up with colleagues from different media outlets — but everyone is busy and has work to do so it’s seldom too distracting. Usually a hot meal is served — lasagna and roasted chicken are past favourites. There is lots of coffee and tea to keep us awake and large carafes of refreshing cucumber and lemon-infused water to keep us hydrated.",[],863,0.9546632841305387

This week, we look at how Freedom-of-Information legislation can allow governments to shield information from the public.

A great many public-interest stories that have appeared in the Toronto Star were the result of Freedom-of-Information requests made by journalists to government ministries, organizations and agencies.

Readers will often see phrases like “according to documents obtained through a Freedom-of-Information request,” or “documents uncovered through access-to-information legislation reveal ...” in stories about decisions our institutions make behind closed doors.

But what doesn’t get reported is the usually painstaking process journalists go through in an attempt to get the information. First they have to figure out exactly what to ask for. This is often followed by months-long — or sometimes years-long — delays and fights over the often high fees charged.

The high cost of accessing public records is a barrier to democracy, experts say

$32,000 and a 3-year wait: Star reporters share what it’s like trying to access public documents in Canada

Freedom-of-Information legislation gives members of the public who pay a $5 fee the right to ask municipal, provincial and federal governments for almost any kind information these institutions hold, with some exceptions. There are usually further fees for the time spent searching for the requests and making copies.

Requesters unhappy with the cost, the amount of time the request is taking, or the responsiveness of the government, can appeal to provincial and federal information and privacy commissioners for assistance. But this process can add months to an already slow process.

Journalists who use the system regularly have been complaining for years that the Freedom-of-Information system is broken, but little has been done by governments that has made it more accessible.

The recent travails of city hall reporter Jennifer Pagliaro, during her quest to uncover information from the City of Toronto about the controversial Scarborough subway extensions, show the lengths the media, as representatives of the public, have to go through to get information that is the property of the public.

In mid-2015, Pagliaro requested emails, memos, and other documents from the time council voted to scrap a light-rail line fully funded by the province to when council made the decision to build a subway instead.

“It’s so hard to get at the truth with issues like the Scarborough subway. There is so little evidence to justify building it and also a lot of misinformation. That makes it difficult to know if politicians are spending our money wisely,” Pagliaro said. “Are they doing it based on the facts or because of political motivations? Freedom of information laws are one of the ways we try to shed light on issues like a controversial subway project.”

City staff told Pagliaro that her request would cover thousands of emails and asked her to consider narrowing the requested search, which was for “Scarborough subway” and “Scarborough LRT.” She did not change her request. A month later, the city told Pagliaro its estimated fee for the information was $1,755, and that it needed a nine-month extension because staff whose records she had requested were too busy. (At the City of Toronto, staff whose records are requested must do their own searches, as opposed to Freedom-of-Information co-ordinators who do this at other government institutions.)

Pagliaro paid the $877.50 deposit (50 per cent of total fee estimate, as is required by law) but at the same time appealed the fee and the delay to the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario.

During the appeal process, the city lowered its fee estimate to $1,485 but requested an additional year to fulfil the request.

After nearly a year of back-and-forth discussions with the commissioner’s office and waiting for a resolution, the commissioner ruled the city could have four more months to respond to Pagliaro’s request and that the fee estimate was reasonable.

Despite that ruling, however, the final batch of records was delivered to Pagliaro two weeks late. In all, it took nearly two years to get all of the records requested.

Among the revelations contained in the records: Prior to council’s July 2013 vote to approve the multibillion-dollar Scarborough subway, former city planner Jennifer Keesmaat tried but failed to convince her colleagues behind-the-scenes that the fully-funded seven-stop light-rail line was still the best plan.

“It concerns me that a system purporting to be designed to allow access to public information was set up to be incredibly onerous on the person seeking that information,” Pagliaro said. “The result is often legislated secrecy.”

The Star’s managing editor Irene Gentle adds the issue is bad enough for members of the press, “But this system is meant for everyone. The government is asking citizens not used to the system to try to navigate it with months or years of delays, mounting costs and appeals. The cost is public information remaining secret. That’s a dangerous thing.”

This week, we look at how the Star’s Growing Pains series was conceived with the goal of presenting solutions to challenges that come with Toronto’s increasing density.

A North York school that students can see from their apartment balconies but can’t attend. A cluster of modern waterfront condos in Etobicoke surrounded by traffic-clogged roads. Cars, trucks, streetcars and buses competing for space along crawling downtown streets during rush hour.

These are just a few of the challenges of living in an increasingly crowded city that the Star has explored in its Growing Pains series — a weekly examination of the impacts density is having on our ability to live, work, play and get around in Toronto.

Spearheaded by Doug Cudmore, senior editor in beats, bureaus and columnists, the project grew out of a newsroom discussion involving several editors and reporters late last year about how the Star could highlight the city’s housing issues. Common themes emerged from the discussion, such as affordability and livability. But the team decided to focus on density, and how the city deals with it, as it is one of the issues that most impacts our quality of life.

The team decided to highlight how various Toronto neighbourhoods were being affected by increasing density — and ways to make things better.

But where to start? Various beat reporters, namely Education Reporter Andrea Gordon, Transportation Reporter Ben Spurr, Real Estate Reporter Tess Kalinowski and City Hall Reporter Jennifer Pagliaro were asked to help map out potential areas of coverage.

Former intern reporter Alex McKeen (now a reporter for Metro News in Vancouver), helped kick off the series with a story that delved into census data to identify areas that were intensifying rapidly. She compared the number of people per hectare in each census tract between 2011 and 2016. What she found was some neighbourhoods, such as Liberty Village and Humber Bay Shores, were intensifying at rates many times the city’s average. Her research culminated in a story earlier this month on how developments are popping up across the GTA, often without sufficient access to transit, parks and schools.

Cudmore says he believes a lot of the problems facing Toronto aren’t due to density per se, but rather the fact that the city has a tendency to address density in “easy, profitable” ways, such as building more housing, while pushing the harder planning challenges further into the future.

“Think of the great upheaval we felt this winter as the city closed King St. W. to through traffic,” Cudmore says. “We have to get those overstuffed streetcars through, in large part because we suddenly built a dense neighbourhood in Liberty Village, but we didn’t quite build the transit capacity to deal with them. That’s not likely just going to be a one-off.”

When it comes to figuring out which services need to be addressed, the team relies on beat reporters who have spent months or years building contacts and observing changes in their areas of coverage.

To show how density is impacting how we educate our children, Education Reporter Andrea Gordon delved deeper into the Yonge and Sheppard area, where residents had been complaining for years about how their kids couldn’t go to the most nearby school. She wanted to give a first-hand look at the situation, reporting earlier this month of children in a North York highrise condominium who can look out over McKee Public School next door but can’t attend. That’s because the school is at 110 per cent capacity (the school has doubled in size to almost 800 students in the last 10 years).

Transportation Reporter Ben Spurr knew residents of Etobicoke’s Humber Bay Shores, made up of modern condo towers close to Lake Ontario, had been advocating for a new GO Train station nearby. He wrote a story published last weekend on the need to help alleviate its roadways that are clogged with traffic every weekday morning due to a poorly planned transportation network.

“Issues like municipal zoning bylaws and appeals at the Ontario Municipal Board may sound boring on their face, but they have a dramatic effect on the daily lives of citizens,” Spurr says. “I think what we were trying to get at with this series is how small decisions taken — or not taken — by local leaders can snowball and create huge problems for residents years down the line. The local government then needs to go back in and try to fix a problem that wouldn’t have been nearly as severe if collectively we’d exercised some forethought in the first place.”

Cudmore echoes Spurr’s assessment.

“One of the goals of this series is to tie together a few strands of urban frustration and to show readers that they were related,” he said. “The other was to look for solutions and give them some air; for instance, Andrea’s piece spelled out clearly how funding regulations meant that some kids might never get a chance to go to their neighbourhood school. There are changes that can be made on those fronts.”

Cudmore stresses Growing Pains isn’t about NIMBYism or fighting density.

“It’s the opposite of that. But if we don’t address the details of density, it’s a change that might not last.”

This week, we look at how the Star spent more than two years attempting to confirm that Toronto police use the controversial Stingray cellphone data-catching device.

Two and a half years ago, an adjudicator for the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario upheld a decision by the Toronto Police Services Board to neither confirm nor deny that the force had acquired cellphone data-capturing devices known as IMSI catchers, or Stingrays.

That decision came following a Freedom-of-Information request made by an unidentified citizen in an attempt to find out if the police had purchased the technology.

In his ruling, Information and Privacy Commissioner adjudicator Donald Hale wrote the disclosure of this information “could reasonably be expected to reveal investigative techniques which are either in use or could likely be used in law enforcement.”

Four months later, in an interview with the Star, Ontario Privacy Commissioner Brian Beamish said it was not apparent to him that the public interest was given full consideration by the adjudicator. “Were we to have another appeal, I think it could lead to a different conclusion, let me put it that way,” Beamish said at the time.

That remarkable response prompted Star reporters Wendy Gillis, Kate Allen and Jayme Poisson to file their own Freedom-of-Information requests (later reduced to one) asking for confirmation of whether or not Toronto police use the technology.

This, despite the fact a Toronto police spokesperson had told the Star in 2015: “We do not use the Stingray technology and do not have one of the units.”

IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity) catchers, or Stingrays, work by imitating cell towers thereby forcing phones within a certain range to connect to them. The devices are controversial because they are indiscriminate in targeting mobile phones. This means unique identifying cellphone data from innocent citizens in the vicinity of the police’s target is also collected.

“I think all three of us were picking up on the fact that there was this technology that police may — or may not — be using that could suck up a ton of personal data alongside the information they needed,” said Gillis in an interview. “It seemed unbelievable that they would be able to do this and not tell the public about it, meaning there could be no oversight or rights safeguards.”

But getting clarity would become a two-year saga for the reporters.

Police initially missed the 30-day deadline that institutions are given to process Freedom-of-Information requests, so the reporters appealed arguing a missed deadline was a “deemed refusal.”

The police eventually responded by saying no responsive records existed and closed the file.

The reporters appealed again, this time to the Information and Privacy Commissioner.

In the police response to the Commissioner, it was revealed that no electronic search had actually been conducted. The force had made inquiries with its legal, purchasing, telecom and intelligence departments and apparently confirmed that no records existed. However, they had not done an electronic search because they said they would get a “system error” resulting from too many hits, effectively crashing their computers, and that this would “unreasonably interfere with the operations of the police.”

The adjudicator called this justification “untenable” and ordered the police to do a further search.

The reporters then negotiated more narrow wording for their request with the Toronto police Freedom-of-Information co-ordinator in an attempt to speed up the process. This essentially reset the clock on the request, meaning police would be granted another 30 days to respond to the “new” request.

Finally, two years after their initial request, the reporters received an answer. Documents showed that Toronto police used the technology in five separate investigations since 2010.

The reporters published their findings on March 5. In the story, Mark Pugash, director of communications for Toronto police, was asked why police initially said they did not use the technology and did nothing to correct the record. He responded: “We should have.”

“Part of the problem is that secrecy begets secrecy. In this case, there was no established procedure or expectation that the public would be told about this,” said Gillis. “There is generally a lack of understanding about this tool, and what it is capable of — in part because we don’t know the extent to which it’s being used — that reduces the pressure on police to disclose this information in the first place.”

This week, we look at how judicial red tape almost stymied reporting on two court appearances of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur.

When the Star learns about an individual charged by Ontario police with high-profile crimes, reporters will often contact the Ministry of the Attorney General, police and court record offices to find out if the accused has any prior convictions.

In the case of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur, the Star did just that and learned from the ministry that in 2003, McArthur had been convicted of one count of assault causing bodily harm and one count of assault with a weapon in relation to an incident two years prior. He was handed a conditional sentence of two years less and day and put on probation for three years.

The Star reported this in January. In early February, legal affairs reporter Jacques Gallant asked the ministry if there were any audio recordings from McArthur’s 2003 case. Gallant was curious to know what arguments were made by McArthur’s lawyers, the Crown attorney prosecuting the case, and whether or not McArthur spoke in court.

That seemingly simple request began what was to become a convoluted and frustrating odyssey through red tape as Gallant attempted to report on the proceeding.

Initially, the Ministry of the Attorney General told Gallant that staff at Old City Hall courthouse could find no recordings related to McArthur from 2003. Then, a week later, on Feb. 16, the ministry emailed Gallant to say that in fact there were recordings — one from January 2003, in which McArthur entered a guilty plea, and one from April 2003 for McArthur’s sentencing hearing. To access them, Gallant would need permission from the presiding judge and a court order. He was told this is judicial policy for recordings made prior to April 15, 2013. Since then, the introduction of digital recording devices has made recorded in-court proceedings easier to share with the media.

A ministry spokesperson said the ministry “recognizes that Ontario’s court system is based on the fundamental principles of openness and accessibility.”

In this case, because the presiding judge had retired, Gallant had to ask the local administrative judge at Old City Hall for the order. That judge wasn’t available for another five days.

On Feb. 21, Gallant finally got his day in court to ask for the recordings. The judge didn’t know if there were any publication bans on the 2003 proceedings and delayed her decision while court staff checked.

Later that day, once it was confirmed there were no publication bans, the Crown said he could prepare a draft order that night for the judge to sign the following day.

On Feb. 22, Gallant was told he could go to the courthouse to listen to the tapes or receive copies. The option he chose would have to be specified on the court order. He asked the Crown for copies, figuring it would be more convenient, and signed an agreement that he would not disseminate the recordings or let anyone else listen to them.

At around 2:30 p.m. that day, Gallant got word his request had been granted. He jumped in a cab and raced to the court reporters’ office at Old City Hall. Once there, he had to wait half an hour while copies were made.

But instead of providing the recordings of the 2003 McArthur proceedings on CD, the court reporters’ office gave him two cassette tapes. Gallant would need a Sony BM-246, a special tape recorder used in court, to listen to them.

“It’s like this massive machine straight out of the ’80s. We certainly did not have one of those at the Star and I wasn’t really sure where we’d get one,” Gallant said.

Trying another approach, Gallant’s editor, Matt Carter, sent out a mass email to Star staff asking: “Does anyone in the newsroom have a standard, 1980s-style cassette player on hand? (Or in their car?)”

“Colleagues started coming forward with cassette players caked in dust that had literally been sitting on their desks for years,” said Gallant.

After about half an hour, a working cassette player was found. However, Gallant said the voices on the recordings sounded like chipmunks and were unintelligible.

By then it was 6 p.m., just three hours from deadline and editors were keen to get the story if there was compelling material on the recordings.

Free audio software found on the internet proved to be the ticket. It slowed the audio on the tapes so Gallant could understand what was said in court.

Gallant began furiously transcribing. By 8:30 p.m. he had filed a story about McArthur’s first court appearance in 2003. The story revealed, among other things, that McArthur himself went to police shortly after he attacked a man on Halloween 2001.

The next day, Feb. 23, Gallant transcribed the recording of McArthur’s second 2003 court appearance — the sentencing hearing. The tape revealed the Crown’s reasoning for wanting to bar McArthur from the Gay Village and stay away from sex workers. The story also included a quote from McArthur apologizing.

“Courts are supposed to be open to the public. Yet even as a journalist who regularly covers courts, it was very difficult to get access to these recordings,” Gallant said. “I can’t imagine what a member of the public would have to go through to get access to this kind of a record.”",[],897,0.9740201444162979

This week, we look at how the Star’s editorial cartoonists turn inspiration into art.

On the afternoon before Valentine’s Day, Theo Moudakis sat down at his desk in his home office and instead of drawing, as one might expect the Toronto Star’s editorial cartoonist to do, he started writing poetry.

“Roses are red, I’m serious, dude, slide over close, I wanna collude,” was one poem Moudakis came up with. Here’s another: “I forgot to buy candy and flowers, my sweet, I’ve got an idea, I’ll send you a tweet.”

If you haven’t guessed, these were just two of four poems featured in Moudakis’ “Donald Trump Valentine’s Day Cards” editorial cartoon published on Feb. 14. The first poem accompanies a drawing of Trump with his arm around a bare-chested Vladimir Putin, while the second is written above a picture of Trump on his mobile phone next to his wife, Melania Trump, who is giving her husband the death stare.

The cartoon, a sequel of sorts to Moudakis’ first Donald Trump Valentine’s Day Cards cartoon last year that featured a similar theme, is a recent favourite of the artist.

“No cheap shots, nothing nasty, just funny,” says Moudakis, who has been creating editorial cartoons for the Star since 2000. “And it got enough people upset without it turning into an actual controversy. The laugh is always the cartoonist’s most lethal weapon.”

Indeed, Moudakis says it’s better to be funny than controversial. “Controversy is overrated. You don’t really want the entire city mad at you. Getting a good laugh always makes for the best cartoon.”

That’s not to say some readers won’t find editorial cartoons controversial or distasteful. In fact, controversy can and does play an important role in editorial cartoons. As the Star’s public editor Kathy English wrote in a November 2014 column, “editorial cartoons are visual commentaries, intended to make a point and make us think. Quite often, the best of them also offend and even infuriate some readers.”

As a commentator, Moudakis, who contributes most of the Star’s editorial cartoons, which appear on the editorial page, has licence to not only express his opinions about any given topic, but also to poke fun at, mock, scorn, taunt, and tease his subjects. Politicians in particular have long found themselves ripe for skewering by the editorial cartoonist’s pen.

“In the end, cartoonists aren’t journalists. The rules are different for us. We’re the only ones at a newspaper who don’t deal in facts or fairness, but I make sure to spread the unfairness around evenly,” he says.

Where does Moudakis find inspiration? Keeping up-to-date on the latest news is half the battle. His days start early, usually around 5:30 a.m. with a scan of morning news shows, newspapers and websites. By 8 a.m., he’s at his desk sketching ideas by hand, trying out wording and refining the message he wants to send.

“This is the most challenging and really the most thrilling part of the day. There’s nothing like nailing a good idea,” says Moudakis, who quit art school to become a cartoonist.

When he has something he thinks has merit, Moudakis will run it by his boss, editorial page editor Andrew Phillips, for feedback. Moudakis will then draw the final version of the cartoon on paper with a marker, scan it into his computer, and colour it digitally. He’s normally finished by 2 p.m.

In the case of the Trump Valentine’s Day cartoon, however, he started a day early in order to come up with four good poems.

“The poems done, I was free to leisurely draw everything the next morning, including all that hand-lettering,” he says. “It was one of those cartoons that was an absolute joy to do from beginning to end.”

Patrick Corrigan, who usually contributes the Star’s Saturday editorial cartoon, has a similar process, and says he looks for storylines with long shelf lives, due to the fact that he works ahead a few days.

“Over the years I’ve become patient if an idea is slow in coming,” Corrigan explains. “It’s like finding a parking spot downtown. Sometimes you just gotta go ‘round the block a few times.”

Corrigan says he gravitates towards social issues, trends and local politics.

Last Saturday’s cartoon, for example, humorously combined two current news events — Ontario’s Progressive Conservative Party shakeup and the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic Games — to make an observation about the turmoil facing the PCs. The cartoon featured several skiers flying uncontrollably off a long “Ontario PC Jump.”

“I was trying to lend a satirical take on their hapless process, so it was a natural fit to show them flying head over heels off the Olympic ski jump,” says Corrigan, who first joined the Star in 1983 as a staff illustrator.

At the end of the day, the job of an editorial cartoonist, says Corrigan, is to speak truth to power in an irreverent, satirical fashion.

“In other words, we hope to make the deserving subject choke on their morning oatmeal when they open their paper.”

This week, we look at how the Star’s sports department handles the demands of covering the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.

At 9:51 p.m. last Sunday, Toronto Star sports editor Dave Washburn watched as Canada clinched its first gold medal in the Pyeongchang Olympics.

Washburn immediately alerted the news desk of the monumental achievement — a gold medal in the figure skating team event.

Knowing that the Canadian team had a good chance of winning a medal, Washburn had earlier asked senior editors if a later print deadline was possible. Normally, the final print deadline on Sundays is 11 p.m., but this time Washburn was able to secure an extra half-hour.

At 10:10 p.m., columnist Rosie DiManno, on assignment in Pyeongchang, South Korea — where it was around noon the next day — filed a 1,000-word piece on how Patrick Chan’s and Gabrielle Daleman’s free skate performances lifted the Canadian team to the top of the podium.

DiManno’s story was quickly edited by the sports desk and sent online at 10:37 p.m. It was laid out for the newspaper and went to press at 11:12 p.m.

The adrenalin-fuelled rush to get the story in the paper is illustrative of the situations Washburn (working in Toronto) and his team in South Korea — columnists DiManno, Bruce Arthur and Dave Feschuk, along with reporter Kerry Gillespie and photographer Steve Russell — have faced daily as they work to keep Star readers up to date on the Games.

Keeping a close eye on developments and anticipating outcomes played a big role in ensuring the Canadian figure skating team’s gold medal made it into print.

“We knew on Saturday night the Canadian team was in prime position to win gold, but the expected end time was going to be right after our one and only Sunday print deadline,” said Washburn in an interview. “On Sunday night, we were able to push back the print deadline, which gave us an extra half-hour. When you’re dealing with tight deadlines and not knowing what can happen in the games, those extra minutes matter.”

Preparations for the games — getting accreditation for journalists, finding accommodations close to events and determining arrival and departure dates — started a year ago with the help of both the Canadian Olympic Committee and the Pyeongchang Olympic Committee.

To know which athletes to watch closely, the team focused on past performances and popularity. For example, the team knew figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir would be popular competitors given their history of medal wins and on-ice chemistry.

Washburn says he is also relying on the knowledge of beat reporter Gillespie, who covers amateur sports for the Star, in guiding the newspaper’s coverage. For example, Gillespie recommended following speedskater Kim Boutin, who took the bronze in the women’s 500 metres, and Alex Gough, who took the bronze in women’s singles luge.

“We want to make sure we’re at events when there’s a good chance of us hitting the podium,” Washburn said.

A few days before the Games began, Washburn started working overnight shifts. And since the opening ceremony, Star web editors have been working day and night to update thestar.com in real time.

The 14-hour time difference between South Korea and Toronto wreaks havoc with work hours and sleeping patterns for all involved in the coverage.

Print media, by its nature, is not as immediate as television, which affords opportunities to go behind the scenes of the drama to tell stories that aren’t suited to live TV.

“Our columnists are some of the best at that. Having the ability to make you chuckle, make you shed a tear perhaps — maybe even make you angry,” Washburn said.

For example, earlier this week, Arthur wrote an article about speedskater Ted-Jan Bloemen’s emotional response to his Olympic gold medal victory. In the crowd, his wife was also crying, but because she had just learned of the loss of a friend’s baby.

To extend the Star’s coverage, a few reporters in Toronto write a daily roundup of the quirkier goings-on at the Games — gleaned from wire services, Star reporter dispatches and photos. This is labelled “Olympic Notables” and is published on page 2 of the sports section each day. Topics have included the eating habits of athletes, funny or odd utterances by competitors and those covering them, and interesting fashion choices.

“We want to give our readers not only the latest Olympic news to the best of our ability, but also provide insight regarding athletes and events so that they come away from our coverage feeling like they have a better, fuller picture of what’s going on,” Washburn said.",[],774,0.925478856352338

This week, we look at how the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau balances the demands of covering three major political parties.

Since Patrick Brown resigned as leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives over sexual misconduct allegations just over two weeks ago, the troubles facing the party have been top stories in the Toronto Star every day.

The upheaval rocking the official Opposition — which has also seen Rick Dykstra resign as party president in the face of sexual assault allegations, and investigations into suspect membership lists and questionable party spending in the Brown era — has made for a busy time for the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau.

Add to that the PC’s rush to elect a new leader ahead of this summer’s provincial election at a time when the sitting Liberals are set to table their 2018 budget, and readers might wonder how the bureau is able to juggle covering all three parties thoroughly and fairly.

“Adrenalin and caffeine help,” says Robert Benzie, the Queen’s Park bureau chief, who along with fellow reporters Rob Ferguson and Kristin Rushowy, and columnist Martin Regg Cohn, work to hold Ontario’s elected officials to account and keep the public informed.

In the race to replace Brown, each of the leadership hopefuls — Christine Elliott, Doug Ford and Caroline Mulroney — have their supporters and detractors keenly observing how much press their candidate is getting.

“Any one of them could be the next premier of Ontario, so we have to take them all very seriously,” said Benzie in an interview, noting that he strives for equal coverage of all candidates. “It’s early days yet, but for example, there’s a leadership debate next week and we will cover it. It doesn’t mean that every candidate will get exactly the same number of words in the story, but we try to give them equal time.”

The fact that all three leadership candidates have greater-than-usual name recognition hasn’t affected how the bureau is covering the leadership race, says Benzie, but it has generated intense reader interest.

“Christine Elliott is a known commodity given that this is her third run at the leadership, and her late husband, Jim Flaherty, ran twice before. Caroline Mulroney is the eldest child of a very famous Canadian political figure, and Doug Ford is a well-known Toronto councillor and brother to the late ex-mayor of Toronto Rob Ford,” he said. “So you have three big names in a race and that is always interesting.”

How does the bureau cope with balancing the demands of covering the PC party with the demands of covering the other two major political parties?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Liberals and the New Democrats have been content lately to go to ground and let the turmoil in the PC party, currently led by interim leader Vic Fedeli, consume the headlines.

“It’s an old political axiom that when your opponents are pouring gasoline on themselves and lighting a match, you stand back,” said Benzie. “I think Mr. Fedeli has done a good job in terms of making changes from the Brown era, but if you’re the Liberals or the New Democrats, you just want to say stand back, and let the Tories do their thing. Then, after the dust settles, come in and shoot the wounded.”

The Star’s trust committee periodically hears from readers who perceive the newspaper’s political coverage as biased in favour of the Liberals. Since 1987, the Star’s editorial board, which operates separately from the newsroom, has endorsed the Liberals in every provincial election, except in 1999 when the newspaper endorsed Howard Hampton’s NDP. But any suggestion that this affects how the newspaper’s Queen’s Park reporters do their jobs is nonsense, says Benzie.

“I used to work for the Toronto Sun and the National Post and I’m the same reporter that I was then. I didn’t care about the editorials at those outlets and I don’t care about the editorials at the Star,” he said.

Ferguson agreed: “I used to cover Queen’s Park for The Canadian Press during the last months of Bob Rae and the beginning of Mike Harris’s government. No one called me a Liberal hack back then.”

Ferguson points out that he spent all of September, October and November of last year covering two political corruption trials involving the Liberals — the byelection bribery trial in Sudbury and the gas plants trial in Toronto. He added the Star was one of the few media organizations to attend the gas plants trial every day.

Rushowy, who joined Queen’s Park a year-and-a-half ago, stressed that bureau reporters do their best to get voices from all three major parties in stories, as the parties all have elected representatives at Queen’s Park.

“We try to give readers as many viewpoints as possible,” she said.

At the end of the day, says Benzie, it would be detrimental to the Star’s ability to cover politics if any reporters were seen to be leaning toward any party.

“You don’t want anyone thinking you’re a Liberal or Tory or NDP hack, because then the other two parties won’t talk to you,” he said, adding he does not vote in any elections. “We take this place seriously and because we do, we are taken seriously.”

This week, we present highlights of the Star’s recent Ask Me Anything on Reddit.

One of the primary goals of the Toronto Star’s trust project, launched last May, is to be more transparent about how we do our journalism.

Hence the decision to hold an “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) on Reddit, an online news aggregation and rating website where users can post content and discuss a wide array of topics.

Over a two-hour period last Tuesday, a group of Star reporters and editors responded to more than 60 questions from readers.

What follows is a sampling of the questions and answers from the AMA. Some have been shortened for space, but you can read the full text on reddit.com.

What is the top municipal story in Toronto that nobody’s talking about? — Zombie_John_Strachan

Columnist Edward Keenan: The thing about this question is that if I thought a story was the top one in the city, I’d be talking about it — and I assume the same goes for most editors and reporters. So finding the pressing issue everyone’s ignoring is hard, since we wouldn’t ignore it if we knew about it and thought it was very important. That said, I think that the dire lack of affordable housing in the city, and the desperate inability of Toronto Community Housing to fill the gap for the poorest in the city, remains an under-discussed story. It does get talked about, but it’s a crisis.

How does Daniel Dale stay sane going from covering Ford to covering Trump? — Knowitall99

Washington Bureau Chief Daniel Dale: It’s actually so much fun. Obviously exhausting and often ridiculous, but what more can you ask for as a journalist? The stories are both important and entertaining, you’re able to hold powerful people accountable, readership is super high, and you’re not putting yourself at physical risk the way journalists are in a war zone or disaster zone ... So there are moments when I just want to nap, but I mostly love it.

I’m very curious as to how you go about correcting an error that has already been published, and how often you see mistakes and how they’re handled. — RJJouranls

Public Editor Kathy English: Once we verify an error we correct on the platform the mistake was published on as promptly as is possible. The goal of a correction is to provide the correct information and make clear a mistake occurred. We logged about 1,100 corrections in print and online in 2017. Most of the mistakes are from online platforms.

What was it like last week at the Star when the Patrick Brown story broke so late in the evening? Are people woken up, called back from home, etc.? — LesterBePiercin

Queen’s Park Reporter Kris Rushowy: Our Queen’s Park bureau chief, Robert Benzie, was at home with his kids when he got a call about Brown’s 9:45 p.m. press conference, and raced over to the Legislature. He was up well into the night filing updates. Reporters don’t get a lot of wake-up calls, but when there is big news on our beats, we work — late nights, early mornings, holidays, you name it.

Do you have any strategic initiatives to avoid enabling loud-mouthed, extreme, populist election candidates by covering their shenanigans? We’ve seen this issue a lot with the Fords and Trumps of the world. — sunlightjunkieRiverdale

City Hall Reporter Jennifer Pagliaro: This is tough. Look at the Ford example. In 2010, Ford was a councillor known for politically incorrect statements on the council floor who few believed could ever be mayor. Our bureau chief, David Rider, was one of the first mainstream media reporters to start paying attention to his campaign and realize he had a base of support that could make him a contender. To me, that’s something our readers should know about … Turns out, he knew before many that Ford could win and he was right.

The Star seems to be working with the CBC more and more, especially for investigative projects. What are the benefits of working together? Do you think these partnerships will happen more frequently? — Soshane

Investigative Reporter Diana Zlomislic: In the past few years, we’ve actually been joining forces with more news media outlets across the world for big investigations like the Panama Papers. Reporter Robert Cribb and editor Lynn McAuley created our investigative co-production team as a way to share resources on big stories. This is the future, we think: news organizations working together more on large projects.

Just wanted to ask, directed broadly at all of you, if you think there’s a real future for young people looking to get into journalism? I’m in my final year of J-school now and I’m pretty disillusioned. — friendsfromgr8

Reporter Fatima Syed: I totally get the disillusionment but don’t let it overcome you! There are multiple opportunities in the industry right now for a young journalist, ranging from freelancing to stints at places like the Star. There are risks in everything but keep hustling. Pitch stories everywhere, apply to places like the Star who accept a wide range of interns of all levels of experience every year.

Things are definitely changing with people looking towards more digital stuff. The main takeaway is just learn as many skills as you can now as a young journalist ... It’s hard, and at times disheartening, but not impossible. Take it from a girl who applied three times before she got the Star internship.

What’s a story that you’ve published that went against your personal beliefs? — TorontoJD

Photographer Steve Russell: Wow, what a great question. I think we cover stories all the time that may go against my personal beliefs. It’s strange because sometimes covering a story or watching a story develop I might change my belief!

What is the role of print media in society in 2018? How do you envision the future of the Toronto Star 10 years from now? — SheerDumbLuck

Managing Editor Irene Gentle: In terms of news organizations like the Star, print is just one of the platforms we publish on. Its legacy is really the journalistic values it has ingrained in us — things like responsible reporting, checks and balances, such as our public editor, Kathy English, our membership in the national news-media council, and our daily talk about journalistic ethics as it pertains to news we cover … Now we take those same principles and apply them to the different platforms. We look to make a difference, to produce solid investigative and accountability journalism on many platforms … That is the how I see the Star in 10 years — the platform matters less than the work that is produced.

This week, we look at how the Star’s style committee strives to maintain a clear, consistent and sensitive presentation of content.

Is Toronto’s new nickname “The 6ix,” “The Six,” or “The 6”? Is the capital of Ukraine spelled Kiev or Kyiv? Are the 2018 Winter Olympics taking place in Pyeongchang or PyeongChang? Does Toronto have an ombudsman, ombudswoman or ombudsperson when the office-holder is female?

These are just a few questions tackled recently by the Star’s style committee, whose role is to ensure consistency in editorial style across all Star platforms. (See how the committee dealt with these questions in the fact box at the end of this article).

Words are powerful, and that’s why members of the style committee, made up of editors and reporters, take their job seriously.

This involves being a resource for the newsroom, keeping the Star’s stylebook up to date with contemporary terms and conventions of usage, and weighing in on style-related questions and concerns raised by readers, often relayed by the public editor.

What does the word “style” mean in the context of the Star’s various platforms?

Anthony Collins, the Star’s style chief and co-chair of the style committee, describes style as a set of rules about the language the Star uses, encompassing everything from spelling and capitalization to how we treat numbers and measurements, and the word choices we make when we report on sensitive issues.

“Style is important because it makes our writing clearer, more accurate and more consistent, all of which promote trust in our journalism. It also ensures we’re up to date with language change, while being respectful of the communities we serve, and helps give the Star its distinctive voice,” said Collins in an interview.

Star style is informed by a broad range of sources, including The Canadian Press, which publishes both a stylebook and a capitalization and spelling guide that are used by various media outlets. Other considerations come from the developing use of terms or phrases by the public and feedback from readers.

Sometimes a style is adopted to make stories easier for readers to find. For example, the Star’s style guide uses the spelling Al Qaeda rather than al-Qaida because the first spelling is more common and makes our stories easier to find online.

Style decisions are also made by the newsroom’s top editors, such as in the move to use Daesh instead of ISIS, mainly because the Islamic State is considered neither Islamic nor a state.

Because of the Star’s broad readership, the newsroom is constantly trying to strike a balance between using language that is easily understood by most of our readers, and using terms that are considered up to date and respectful by specific communities, Collins said.

For example, last year, public editor Kathy English announced the Star had decided to capitalize “Indigenous” in all cases, and “Black” in reference to Black people, identity, culture and community. This came about after the style committee had received many passionate and thoughtful arguments in favour of making these changes as a mark of respect. The committee consulted widely with individuals and community groups and then rewrote two sections of the Star’s stylebook.

“I believe decisions as small as changes in newspaper style can have a major effect on marginalized communities and the way they’re seen,” Collins said. “Look at the way the conversation has changed around mental illness, for example. Not using ‘schizophrenic’ as a careless metaphor, or choosing to say ‘die by suicide’ instead of ‘commit suicide,’ can help lessen the stigma. Social justice is one of the Star’s guiding principles and I think our language use should reflect our philosophy.”

A hard-and-fast rule isn’t always the answer in many cases. For instance, Star style dictates that gender-neutral terms are preferred for occupations, such as firefighter and flight attendant, but the term “actress” is still used when it comes to award show nominations.

Then there’s the sheer practicality that comes with a clear and consistent style, says the Star’s style committee co-chair Jon Ohayon. If editors and reporters are confused about what terms and spellings to use, when to convert measurements to metric, or what currency to use, time can be wasted. A lack of consistency can also make it hard to find previous stories or photos in the Star’s archive or online — and also lead to an impression of carelessness.

“For example, it would look sloppy or ridiculous to have a headline that says ISIS on one story and one that says Daesh on another, or to have two different spellings of a city, country or person on the same page,” said Ohayon.

“Without style, we would be a mess and that leads to a loss of trust.”

What did the Star’s style committee decide?

1. Is Toronto’s new nickname “The 6ix,” “The Six,” or “The 6”?

In the Star, it’s The 6. We found that was the most common and clearest way to write it.

2. Is the capital of Ukraine spelled Kiev or Kyiv?

We follow The Canadian Press style (which adopts the Ukrainian rather than the Russian spelling). It’s Kyiv.

3. Are the 2018 Winter Olympics taking place in Pyeongchang or PyeongChang?

We follow The Canadian Press and The Associated Press and spell it Pyeongchang. Definitely not Pyongyang.

4. Does Toronto have an ombudsman, ombudswoman or ombudsperson when the office-holder is female?

It has an ombudsman, currently Susan Opler. Many offices use ombudsman as a gender-neutral term, derived from Swedish. The Star follows the preference of the office in question.

This week, we look at how Opinions Editor Scott Colby curates a wide range of viewpoints from contributors across political, cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds.

Everyone has an opinion.

Scott Colby, the Star’s Opinions Editor, confronts this truism every day.

Colby will receive, on an average day, between 10 and 15 opinion pieces from members of the public covering a whole host of topics. Those hoping to get published run the gamut of the professional world, from politicians, academics, and economists, to lawyers, businesspeople, and health-care professionals. He also hears regularly from non-profit groups, agencies and students.

His job is to sort through the submissions, choosing pieces that provide readers with thoughtful commentary on public interest issues. And that’s in addition to handling opinion pieces from the Star’s regular staff and nonstaff columnists that appear on the page opposite the Editorials page.

This week we sat down with Colby, who’s been the Opinions Editor since May 2016 and an editor at the Star for 20 years, to find out how he presents a wide range of opinions on issues of the day.

How are the opinion pieces you edit, also known as “op-eds,” different from those written by Star columnists?

An op-ed is an old-fashioned name for an opinion piece, or column. Op-ed is an abbreviation of the phrase “opposite the editorial page.” Historically, newspapers publish an editorial page that is home to editorials, an editorial cartoon and letters. The opposite page of the same spread contains columns and other opinion pieces. An op-ed is no different from an opinion piece from a Star columnist in the sense that they are both articles of opinion on a timely topic. Columnists have the prestige of being a regular contributor whose writing and arguments are considered to be of a consistently high standard and they’ve earned the right to express their opinions in that paper up to three to four times a week. They also get a logo.

What makes a good op-ed in your opinion?

I tell people I am looking for three things in a good op-ed: the topic must be timely, it must be well written, and it must be well argued. There is a distinction to be made between well written and well argued. You can have a nicely written article that essentially doesn’t saying anything or make a point. Where I think many writers miss the mark is they don’t understand that an op-ed needs to have a thesis; it needs to be an argument about an issue. We are not looking for a press release in disguise.

How do you solicit op-eds and what do you look for?

When I solicit op-eds it’s because I’m looking for a commentary piece, or pieces, on a specific topic, such as NAFTA or Indigenous issues. In such cases, I am looking for an excellent writer and a person with expertise, or even a newsmaker directly involved in the issue. Soliciting op-eds can take quite a bit of time, which is a rare commodity these days. When I started this job, for example, I felt we needed to hear directly from Indigenous writers and leaders, as opposed to well-meaning supporters, so I reached out. We’ve published op-eds from Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of Nishnawbe Aski Nation, Grassy Narrows Chief Simon Fobister, and Indigenous academics at Trent University. We also want our Opinion page to reflect the changing demographic of the city and country, so having diverse voices is important. Like all mainstream media, we can do a better job, but we believe it is vital to publish diverse voices and we continually aspire to provide them for our readers.

Many of the opinion pieces the Star publishes express views that are counter to the newspaper’s more social-justice leanings. Is this deliberate, and if so, why?

We strongly believe the Opinion page needs to be an open-minded venue. It is an excellent forum for debating the important issues of the day. To be clear, we will never intentionally publish anything that is hateful, insulting or bigoted. But I frequently select commentary that I don’t necessarily agree with, or that puts forward an opinion that contradicts our own editorials. If the author makes a compelling case on a timely issue, it benefits everyone when we publish those views to contribute to the debate. It’s important to listen to arguments from both sides of an issue to understand where each side is coming from. When we can really listen and understand, hopefully we’ll learn something about their motivations, for instance, that might make us more sympathetic, or it might expose something less innocent that deserves scrutiny.

We are not interested in being an echo chamber where readers only listen to the people they agree with. I love it when we can publish a page that contains opposing views on the same topic, as long as both pieces are well written and well argued. For example, earlier this month we published two op-eds taking different stands on the minimum wage increase, one by Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and the other by Premier Kathleen Wynne.

What message do you have for those readers who may view the op-ed pages as a pulpit for politicians to spread positive PR messages about themselves?

We receive a lot of op-eds from politicians and we reject most of them on the basis that they are essentially glorified press releases. When it comes to op-eds, we hold politicians to a higher standard than the public. Their op-eds must be saying something new and adding to the understanding of an important issue. We are vigilant in preventing the Star’s opinion pages from becoming an extension of a politician’s PR department.

This week, we focus on how Jacques Gallant, the Star’s Legal Affairs reporter, keeps tabs on what goes on in Ontario’s justice system.

There is an aphorism often quoted by lawyers and the journalists who cover legal proceedings: “Not only must justice be done; it must also be seen to be done.”

That saying, which originated more than 90 years ago from Gordon Hewart, lord chief justice of England, is constantly in the back of Jacques Gallant’s mind while he navigates the complex world of Ontario’s courts and tribunals.

As the Star’s Legal Affairs reporter, Gallant takes readers inside the justice system, highlighting precedent-setting cases and rulings that impact the public, and pointing out problems, such as delays in cases coming to trial.

To find stories, Gallant talks to lawyers and members of the public about cases they are involved in, checks with the various colleges that regulate health-related professions, such as the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, to find out which of their members are facing disciplinary hearings, and mines CanLii, a free online database containing most Canadian court decisions.

But keeping readers enlightened about the goings-on of our legal system relies on the assumption that the courts and tribunals are by default open to the public, as they should be. In practice, however, Gallant has found this is not always the case.

“The courts are supposed to be presumptively public, which means that anyone should be able to walk into a courthouse and request to view the file from a court case,” said Gallant.

But on numerous occasions, Gallant has encountered courts and tribunals that seem to have secrecy as their default setting — meaning Star readers, and by extension the public, aren’t able to get a full picture of what is going on in these public institutions.

“In my own experience, I’ve dealt with courthouse staff across the GTA who give me strange looks when they find out I’m not a lawyer, but rather a journalist,” Gallant said. “I’ve had to wait weeks to get access to even the most basic of court documents, known as ‘the information,’ which lists the charges an accused person is facing as well as their next court date.”

Indeed, early last year, the Star launched a legal challenge against the provincial government to end the secrecy surrounding the province’s tribunal system, which handles accusations around human rights abuses, police misconduct, and environmental offences. The Star’s case is ongoing.

Gallant said accessing court exhibits, even in cases that are no longer active and for which higher courts have ruled that exhibits should be public, is also often difficult.

“Documents such as these are crucial in order to accurately and fairly report on a legal matter,” he said.

Case in point: when reporting on the ongoing case of Dr. Javad Peirovy, a Toronto doctor found by the College of Physicians’ discipline committee to have sexually abused four female patients, and who is fighting in court to keep his medical licence, Gallant had trouble accessing documents related to the case.

In 2016, the discipline committee ruled to suspend Peirovy for six months, rather than revoke his licence. The college disagreed with this ruling, and appealed the decision by its own committee to the Divisional Court.

At the time, in order to provide readers with a full picture of the case, Gallant sought to obtain Peirovy’s arguments at Divisional Court for why Peirovy should retain his licence. As it turned out, this was not an easy task.

When Gallant asked the Divisional Court for Peirovy’s official response to the appeal, a court official told him the file was with the judges and could not be accessed.

So Gallant reached out to Peirovy’s lawyer, who would not provide the official response either.

Gallant then had to reach out to the Ministry of the Attorney General to make his case that the file should be made available to him. The ministry, in turn, contacted the court, and a few days later Gallant was told he could now view the file at the Divisional Court.

“If not for (the ministry’s intervention), I would not have been able to report a complete picture of the Peirovy case,” Gallant said.

The college ended up winning its appeal, but Peirovy then appealed to the Court of Appeal. A decision has yet to be released.

These types of situations — where public documents are not readily accessible to the public — discredit the legal system, Gallant said.

“For the Canadian justice system to retain its credibility, it needs to be open and transparent,” he said. “The public needs to be assured that the justice system is working, and reporters act as their representatives in court.”

Perhaps this distinction is not totally evident to you. Based on many conversations with readers, it is clear to me that one of the key sources of misunderstanding about the Star and its journalism is a considerable measure of confusion about how to distinguish between news and opinion.

As a Star reader you have a right to know if what you are reading in the Star is news – verified information based in the impartial reporting of facts – or opinion – a column or editorial based on the personal interpretation and judgments of facts.

The Star’s statement of principles has long expressed this core value, stating that, “Sound practice demands a clear distinction for readers between news and opinion.

“All content that contains explicit opinion or personal interpretation should be clearly identified as opinion or analysis, as appropriate.”

While the Star has long strived to make this distinction clear in the newspaper through the use of various design elements (such as a columnist’s “logo”) intended to denote a piece of opinion journalism, my communications with readers over the past decade tell me these devices are often inadequate for those who don’t understand our design shorthand.

Further muddying these waters is the fact that “opinion” logos, which include a journalist’s photo, are sometimes used on news stories too. How is a reader supposed to distinguish news from opinion?

Discerning news from opinion within the Star’s digital world — on the website, mobile apps and social media postings – is even more of a challenge for readers. Here the Star too often falls short of its own principle. Many days, opinion columns expressing strong views about controversial issues are presented in a similar manner as news stories, within news sections of those digital platforms, with no signposts to indicate that what you are reading is not the news but in fact someone’s opinion about the news.

The clearest way to tell readers that an article represents a writer’s views is to label it as opinion. The Star is now taking steps to do a better job of this on all its platforms.

The Star’s trust initiative , launched in May to look into how the Star can foster greater reader trust and develop journalistic and technological tools to bridge the trust and media literacy gap, identified the need to differentiate news from opinion as a priority issue. This group spent much of the summer looking at how to more clearly and consistently signal to readers on all platforms — including the Star’s social media feeds — when articles are analysis or opinion.

I expect the Star will soon move forward on recommendations to provide stronger signposts to readers about whether they are reading news, analysis or opinion and also give readers clarity about the definitions of various sorts of content.

This is vital at this time of diminishing trust in journalism when the sheer volume of opinions and conjecture about the news can overwhelm the real reporting of verified information.

Indeed, as news organizations around the world grapple with a crisis of trust in journalism, the need to guide audiences to a clear understanding of how to distinguish news from opinion has emerged as a significant indicator of journalistic trust. Several ongoing global trust projects have fixed on the need to do a better job of this.

“One of the most common themes from users is that they are tired of blurred lines between fact and opinion,” Joy Mayer, head of the Trusting News Project, wrote recently in an article reporting on the project’s research into reader feedback on the credibility and trustworthiness of news.

The Trust Project at California’s Santa Clara University has identified the need for labels on content to identify news from opinion as a trust indicator. That project aims to create tools for readers to recognize trustworthy reporting and for platforms such as Google to identify and feature high quality journalism.

A working group of the California-based project has set out clear definitions for various types of content and recommends that news organizations be transparent in sharing those definitions with readers. Both its definitions and recommendation for transparency are aligned with the recommendations of the Star’s trust committee.

That group defines news as articles, “based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources…News reports do not incorporate the opinion of the author.”

Opinion articles “advocate for ideas and draw conclusions based on the author/producer’s interpretation of fact and data. Opinion pieces may include reported facts or quotes, but emphasize the author’s own thoughts, personal preferences and conclusions,” it states.

My opinion: these are smart recommendations critical for enhancing trust in journalism.

It was “not part of the conversation,” TDSB spokesperson Ryan Bird told the Star on Tuesday.

In the interests of transparency, I think it only fair that the Star disclose that there was never any conversation in our newsroom about whether to publish the girl’s name and photographs of her taken at the school board.

The Star has no explicit policies on interviewing or identifying children. Its relatively vague guidelines on children are expressed in our standards manual in a section on privacy: “Children and teenagers — particularly those under the age of 16 who may not fully understand the implications of speaking to the media — command a special sensitivity,” it states.

Family offers ‘sincere apologies’ for 11-year-old girl’s false hijab-cutting story

TDSB did not discuss implications of letting 11-year-old face media over hijab story

Attack on girl wearing a hijab didn’t happen, police say. Why did TDSB let the 11-year-old face the cameras?

As well, it advises that photographers “should be sensitive when photographing children under 16 without permission of a parent or guardian.”

In practice, I know that the newsroom often debates and discusses issues related to children in the news and is particularly sensitive to this when children are victims of crime.

So why didn’t that conversation happen here in this case? Why was no consideration whatsoever given to the possibility of shielding this child’s identity from public view?

The answer is simple and, to me, understandable: This girl’s speaking before media at the school board offices, with school board officials and her mother present, provided sanction for the Star and other media outlets to identify her.

As editor Michael Cooke told me: “The girl was put forward by responsible and caring adults, including her mother. That was enough for me.”

Parental permission to identify children in the news is indeed a significant factor in any judgment call on this issue and is generally the standard stated in those ethics codes that provide specific guidelines on covering children, including Britain’s Editor’s Code of Practice.

In a statement to the media Wednesday, the family said it chose to make the story public, “horrified that there was such a perpetrator who may try to harm someone else.” The mother made clear that at that time, she too believed her daughter’s story. The family has declined the Star’s requests for interviews and expressed its “sincere apologies to every Canadian.”

After Toronto police reported Monday morning that investigators had determined the attack did not happen, the Star decided not to name the girl. I believe that is the right decision and further, that we should consider removing her name from last week’s news reports so this story is not connected to her online identity for the rest of her life. Whatever happened — and it would seem this child told quite a lie — we must remember that she is just a child.

Had that public event at the girl’s school — in effect, a press conference with her mother and her speaking to media — not occurred, it’s likely the initial story would have been limited to reporting what Toronto police had said in the news release that first alerted media to what then was presented as a shocking story for our community. That release, which did not provide the child’s name, reported that an 11-year-old girl was walking to school when she was approached from behind by a man who pulled the hood off her jacket and then cut her hijab with a pair of scissors.

“This is being investigated as a hate crime,” stated that news release, which also included a detailed description of the man.

While the girl’s story was found to be false, this was not “fake news” as some critics have charged. The breaking news reports were based on information from reliable sources: an official police news release about a hate crime investigation involving a child, and an invitation by the school board for the media to talk to the girl with her mother presiding. On the face of it — based on what those valid sources said at that time, and the rush to condemnation by politicians at all levels of government — this was real news.

And now that we know it is not true, all of the institutions involved — including the media — are left to ask ourselves what lessons can be learned here. For my part, I hope this sparks deeper conversation in the media about specific rules on covering and naming children in the digital age.

On that, I was alerted this week to a 2004 Journalism Studies article by Romayne Smith Fullerton, an associate professor at Western University’s Faculty of Information and Media Studies, entitled “Covering Kids: Are journalists guilty of exploiting children?” (Full disclosure: the faculty awarded me a teaching fellowship and I’m now teaching a graduate course on critical issues in media literacy.)

Smith Fullerton examines how media might better assure that children’s stories are told in a responsible, ethical manner and raises the uncomfortable idea that parents might not always know what is best for their children — or fully understand the implications — when it comes to putting them forward to the media.

As she states, in making a strong case that children deserve special care and attention by the media, “few journalists or media outlets rigorously or systematically consider what coverage may mean for children and very few have detailed protocols about interacting with minors.”

Smith Fullerton contends that the media should consider more rigorous consent protocols similar to those required by academic researchers who interview children. She acknowledges the difficulty of this for newsrooms, particularly in breaking news situations.

I agree that the detailed protocols demanded in academia are likely unworkable in the newsroom. But I am aligned with her greater point that “media outlets need to develop valid, respectful and specific procedures for covering children,” and we have some responsibility to make sure parents understand the implications of media coverage of their children.

Children are vulnerable sources and the implications of any news coverage involving them should always be part of the conversation.

Believe nothing at face value; verify what sources say; check and double check. That is what we call due diligence in journalism. This is a core value of the Star’s journalistic standards.

I am not the first journalist to say that the Washington Post provided journalists and readers at large alike with a textbook example this week of due diligence at work in journalism.

Call this the triumph of real reporting.

The Washington Post’s report about a woman who came to Post reporters with what turned out to be a fabricated story about having been impregnated when she was a teenager by Alabama’s Senate candidate Roy Moore, deserves all the accolades it has received for ultimately exposing a scheme to deceive and embarrass that news organization and, in so doing, showing why journalistic standards matter.

As the Post reported, a woman approached its reporters to share a dramatic story about an alleged affair with Moore that led to an abortion when she was 15. Had it been true, this would have indeed been big news.

Here is what bears understanding here. Real reporters do not simply publish what anyone tells them, no matter how dramatic the story presented. Real reporting demands that journalists always take steps to verify what sources tell them, check out the reliability of all sources, seek documentation to back up what sources tell them, ask questions, go back and ask more questions.

The Post reporters were straight with the woman about their fact-checking process, even as the woman pushed them to give their opinion about Moore and whether the story could bring down his candidacy.

In checking out the woman’s story, inconsistencies emerged. Further checking of public records and internet searches uncovered information indicating the woman quite likely worked for Project Veritas, an organization that aims to discredit journalists and mainstream media outlets by trying to trick them into publishing hoax stories and admitting to biased reporting.

But, here, the Post turned the tables and exposed the attempted sting with a first-rate investigative sting operation of its own, in which it confronted the woman with the facts while a hidden camera captured it all on video. Then, the Post published its tour de force report detailing its meticulous reporting about how it discovered the truth about the woman and Project Veritas.

That report also serves as a master class in the journalistic transparency today’s media environment demands. The Post explained its standards to readers, telling them why it had secretly photographed the woman and why it reported her previous off-the-record comments. “We always honour ‘off-the-record’ agreements when they’re entered into in good faith,” said Martin Baron, the Post’s executive editor. “But this so-called off-the-record conversation was the essence of a scheme to deceive and embarrass us. . . . We can’t honour an ‘off-the-record’ agreement that was solicited in maliciously bad faith.”

All of this was journalistic rigour writ large, a prime example of what reporters and editors at serious news organizations like the Star do daily in meeting the standards required by the law and our longstanding ethics policies. While it is disconcerting that individuals and organizations would seek to trick the media into publishing false information — and journalists quite rightly fear being taken in by such hoaxes — we believe that the strong standards of due diligence in which we hold our journalists provides significant protection against our publishing such blatantly bogus information.

“This is how good journalists do their jobs and how they don’t get taken in by hoaxes,” Jane Kirtley, a professor at the University of Minnesota and an expert in media law, said in an Associated Press report of the thwarted hoax. “It’s such an important lesson.”

Indeed, as Post writer Callum Borchers, who covers the intersection of media and politics, wrote this week, journalistic vetting — the essence of what we do — prevented a false claim from being published: “A Project Veritas plot designed to embarrass the media by exposing recklessness demonstrated the media’s care instead.”

In a world in which a previously unimaginable amount of misinformation and disinformation go viral every day, trustworthy journalism from journalists and news organizations that hold themselves to high professional standards and do the real work of reporting to verify facts matters more than ever.

The lessons learned here are important reminders for journalists and citizens alike: Just because someone says it’s true, does not make it so.

On one hand, some of the most celebrated reporting of the past century or so resulted from courageous reporters who went undercover to expose injustices and wrongdoing.

On the other hand, is the fact that journalism’s core value is truth. How can lying to get a story be reconciled with that value?

Like so many ethical issues in journalism, this is not a black and white issue. Journalist’s first obligation is to seek truth and report it. But there are some circumstances when truth can only be discovered by means of deception. In such cases, the overriding value is the public interest.

Did the ends justify the means of the Star’s Sara Mojtehedzadeh going undercover for a month at Fiera Foods, one of Toronto’s largest industrial bakeries, to expose working conditions for precarious workers who rely on temp agencies to find work? In my view, this was most certainly justified.

The Star’s journalistic standards guide makes clear that undercover reporting is a tool of last resort, to be used following extensive consideration at the newsroom’s highest level: “Undercover reporting, photography and surveillance video should be used rarely and a case must be made that the story to be uncovered is of high public interest,” the policy states.

In practice, approval for undercover reporting is given only when reporters and senior editors have determined that the story could not be obtained by other means. Here, editor Michael Cooke and managing editor Irene Gentle made the judgment call to allow Mojtehedzadeh to go undercover. They concluded there was indeed no other way to get this information, and most important, that this was a story of strong public interest.

Mojtehedzadeh had spent many months investigating temp agencies, seeking information about injustices to some of our community’s most vulnerable workers. In reading through hundreds of Ministry of Labour reports and court documents on workers’ injuries she found numerous references to heath and safety violations at Fiera Foods Company and Marmora Freezing Corporation, one of its partner companies.

She also discovered three deaths had occurred at Fiera or in affiliated companies. The most recent happened last year when 23-year-old Amina Diaby, a refugee from Guinea on her first job in Canada, died when her hijab was pulled into a machine as she worked on an assembly line near the conveyer belt. Diaby was hired through a temp agency and had been working at Fiera Foods for two weeks.

“We looked at all of the information and concluded that my going undercover as a temp worker was the only way to get this story. We couldn’t just ask precarious temp workers to tell us what is happening inside the factory,” Mojtehedzadeh told me this week. “In past, I have had cases of temp workers who were fired for speaking up to the Star and I did not want to put anyone at risk of losing their job.

“All of the injury data and the deaths made it clear there was a strong public interest here in the health and safety of temp workers.”

Fiera Foods has also benefited from public funding, having received some $4.7 million dollars in government loans and grants. In response to questions from the Star, the company said that health and safety is a “core principle.”

Following publication of the Star's investigation, Fiera Foods this week was fined $300,000 after pleading guilty to charges under the Occupational Health and Safety Act related to Diaby’s death. As well, the company told the Star it has hired auditors to examine its health and safety practices and temp agency contracts.

If you have not read this investigation by Mojtehedzadeh and Brendan Kennedy, who came into the project to provide further reporting, I hope you do so. Like many readers, I was stunned at what was revealed about the work conditions for these vulnerable workers, both through the undercover reporting and the more “classic” means of obtaining information.

Arguably, undercover reporting is itself a classic reporting technique. In the 2012 book, Undercover Reporting, the Truth about Deception, author Brooke Kroeger argues that undercover work embodies a central discipline of good reporting: “the ability to extract significant information or to create indelible, real-time descriptions of hard-to-penetrate institutions or social situations that deserve the public’s attention.”

The New York University journalism professor has compiled an online public database on undercover reporting that provides many example of outstanding undercover reporting (including some past Toronto Star investigations) and numerous thought-provoking articles about the ethics of journalistic deception.

Star editor Michael Cooke believes strongly that “undercover reporting has a long and noble history and is often courageous work that takes perseverance.

“Look no further than Nelly Bly,” he said, referring to the legendary reporter who went undercover as a patient in a New York insane asylum in the late 1800s.

“Her sensational account of the dreadful conditions and treatment of the patients got action, fast. So Bly made life better for the mentally ill,” Cooke said. “And that’s what it’s all about … trying to make life better.”

I can understand the need for confidential sources in the media, but, as a reader I generally put a little less faith in what is attributed to an anonymous source. How would you generally, decide if a source who wants to remain confidential is reliable?”

The Star’s policy on anonymity states that, “The public interest is best served when news sources are identified by their full names.” When that is not possible and confidential sources — individuals who are not named in the Star — are used in reporting information deemed to be of public interest, the Star’s reporters must take steps to determine the reliability of these sources. This is responsible reporting. In all cases, reporters, and most often their editors too, know the identities of sources granted anonymity in the Star.

Given the ongoing debate about the use of confidential sources in covering Donald Trump’s administration, I have asked the bureau chiefs of the Star’s three Canadian political bureaus to provide their insights on the reader’s question as it pertains to the Star’s political and government coverage. Here are their thoughtful responses.

Bruce Campion-Smith, Ottawa bureau chief

“First off, a confidential source is generally someone we know very well and have a track record with and built on a relationship usually over years. We’ve assured ourselves that they are in a position to know the information they are giving us and that they have a track record of playing straight. Remember the trust cuts both ways. Not only do we have to trust them but they have to trust us.

The source has to absolutely be in a position to know what they are talking about. No second-hand information or gossip. A bottom line is that any information gleaned this way must be fact-based. We don’t allow someone to anonymously trash another individual. That’s just a cheap shot.

Typically, our sources in Ottawa tend to be government officials who cannot speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the information they are passing. To be found out would put their job in jeopardy. These could be whistleblowers or other insiders whose information may reveal truths that the politicians are attempting to hide.

We have to be alert to the motives of the source in providing the information. Usually the passing of information works to their favour in some way too, perhaps by building profile of a story. But we need to do a gut check to understand their motives.”

Robert Benzie: Queen’s Park bureau chief

“In political reporting, granting anonymity to a source is often a necessity in order to get them to say anything beyond boilerplate talking points. As we have seen from The New York Times’ superb reporting on the current president, off-the-record sources are essential to understanding what is going on in the White House.

These people sometimes risk their jobs and reputations to speak to the Star. Yes, their motivations are not always altruistic — though we do hear from whistle-blowers in politics — but the insights can be invaluable. There are many important stories that would never have been exposed without allowing people to speak on background.

Toronto Star readers should trust the confidential sources they see in the Star because Toronto Star reporters do. I do think we need to explain in stories why we are giving sources the right to withhold their names.”

David Rider: City Hall bureau chief

“When thinking about whether to use a confidential source I consider whether the information is of sufficient public interest to justify giving somebody anonymity.

How trustworthy is the source? I never use a confidential source unless I know and trust them from past experience. Anybody who has steered me wrong in the past cannot be trusted with a cloak of anonymity.

Even if I trust them, what are their motivations? What they are saying might be true but I have to have a good sense of why they are doing it to feel comfortable with keeping their identity secret. For example, I will never quote an anonymous source throwing political muck at somebody else. I see this in print often and I cringe because that is essentially helping somebody be a vandal, taking shots without putting their name behind it.

Is there any way I can get the information without using a confidential source? If so, even if it means waiting a day or a two, I will wait.

I don’t pretend that I look at this checklist every time I consider use of a confidential source, but all these considerations go through my mind. People put themselves in peril trusting me to keep their identity confidential and readers trust the Star to provide them information that is reliable and important. I don’t take any of that lightly.”",[],808,0.9259633593912949

My in-box, and those of most other journalists here, is evidence of that.

What is new in recent weeks however is the fact some of those critics are increasingly hurling a new term of insult our way to express disdain about what they read in the Toronto Star: Fake News.

We are seeing this degrading label now in emails, in Facebook and Instagram comments and in tweets directed at the Star and its journalists.

“Go report some real news and stop contributing to fake news,” one such reader told Daniel Dale, the Star’s Washington correspondent.

“Sounds like an alternative fact to me. Fake news,” said a reader who disagreed with a report on road tolls written by David Rider, the Star’s City Hall bureau chief.

“More fake news from the Toronto Star. Sad,” said a reader critical of a Washington Post wire service report about President Donald Trump’s first week in office.

“Sadly, your biased, incorrect and fake news is the reason your newspaper is struggling,” another told me. “Readers want facts.”

Here are the facts: The charge of “fake news” is now being thrown at the mainstream media, by largely partisan critics, as an all-encompassing derisive epithet, largely devoid of its original, and accurate, meaning.

The new U.S. president and his followers have clearly co-opted these words in their campaign to delegitimize the press and discredit legitimate reporting that seeks to hold the new administration to account — as journalists should and must in upholding their responsibilities within a democracy.

Want more facts? Fake news is not news you happen to disagree with. And nor is it news from responsible news organizations that includes mistakes, made honestly and corrected honestly in line with the journalistic commitment to accuracy and fairness. Unfortunately, I have seen this insult used in regard to the Star’s journalism in both of these circumstances, in some cases from people I would have expected to know better, such as a university journalism professor and a former newspaper publisher.

While real fake news is a matter of legitimate concern, the distinction about what is and is not fake news matters much in this troubling time when we face an assault on truth and daily debate about facts and “alternative facts” in what is increasingly coming to be regarded as a “post-truth world.” Easy, derisive labels that allow critics to dismiss outright information they disagree with, or news reports they regard as substandard, seem to me to be dangerously reductive.

So, what is fake news?

To answer that accurately, we must look to Craig Silverman the Canadian journalist who first wrote about the phenomena of fake news for BuzzFeed News in November. Silverman, who has achieved global recognition for this important work, exposed the reality of fraudulent news, deliberately created and shared, largely on Facebook, to gain advertising dollars. Much of what he discovered was pro-Trump fake news that cast his opponent, Hillary Clinton, in a negative light with clearly false information.

Silverman’s reporting provided a fascinating look into the digital media universe and the ease with which wholly made-up “news” could be spread – and seemingly, believed. This “ecosystem” of fabricated information presented as serious news continues to be a significant concern in discerning the credibility of news sources.

But, almost as soon as the term “fake news” became part of our lexicon it was co-opted by Trump for his own ends, casting aspersions on the credibility of legitimate news organizations committed to ethical standards of journalism.

Who could forget Trump, during a televised press conference refusing to take a question from a CNN reporter, telling him, “You are fake news.” Or, his many tweets labeling the New York Times’ carefully sourced journalism as “fake news.” He was at it again this week, tweeting Thursday about “FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and ‘sources.’’’

Silverman is clear about how he defines fake news: “My definition of fake news has three criteria: it has to be 100-percent false – not a news article or partisan site that gets a few facts wrong; it has to be created consciously to be false; and there has to be an economic motive,” he said this week at an event at University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics.

Silverman, now media editor of BuzzFeed News, is well aware that the term has been exploited by critics of legitimate news and will likely continue to be. “I think the term fake news has almost been rendered meaningless at this point,” he said.

Indeed. I have yet to see any validity in any of the “fake news” charges lobbed our way. While it should go without saying, I think it’s safe to say, the Toronto Star is not in the business of fake news. While this news organization’s work does sometimes fall short of its own journalistic standards, to suggest that the Star would deliberately publish false information is wrong. We don’t make stuff up.

And, that’s a fact.",[],826,0.918312110182519

“I am curious about the application of the Toronto Star’s policy on naming the race of suspects,” the reader, who works in the field of human rights law, told me last week. “The description of yesterday’s sexual assault suspect does not mention his race (he appears to be white), in contrast with an earlier story identifying a suspect as black.

“Admittedly, I am more than curious – the ways in which race and suspects are reported can feed into stereotypes about race, propensity and crime,” said the woman, who preferred not to be named in this column.

She is right of course. The media’s depiction of race can have a significant impact on the perception of race in our community. Particularly when it comes to depictions of race and crime.

The Star has long decreed that “no reference, direct or indirect, should be made to a person’s race, colour or religion unless it is pertinent to the story.”

Our policy on racial references makes some exception in the case of a missing person or a criminal suspect at large. In such cases, the policy states, “there may be justification for identifying race or colour as part of a full description that provides as many details as possible. Avoid vague descriptions that serve no purpose.”

This reader pointed out two descriptions of suspects published recently in the Star. As she indicated, a Sept. 18 report of a man wanted for sexual assault made no reference to race in stating that, “The suspect, shown in a security camera picture, is described as about 25 to 35, 5-foot-9 to six feet tall, with medium build and brown hair. He was wearing a red gold shirt, navy blue shorts and brown thong sandals.”

On July 30 however, the Star published a report that did include the race of a suspect wanted in connection with a shooting in Christie Pits Park that left several people injured. “Police have released a photo of a suspect, who was participating in the fitness class, police say. He is described as a black man, 25 to 30-years-old, five-foot-eight to five-foot-nine with short cornrows that were visible from beneath his baseball cap.” The Star did not publish the full description of the man’s clothing, as provided by police, nor did it include the fact that police considered the suspect to be “armed and dangerous.”

The first article in the Star was accompanied by a photo of the suspect — clearly a white man. The second article did not include publication of the suspect photo released by police – likely because it was a blurry, poor quality image.

As I told this reader, generally, the descriptions of suspects published in the Star come directly from police news releases. Still, I told her, there is a strong need for the Star to be consistent about how it reports these sensitive matters, regardless of what information police provide to reporters.

The Toronto police force has its own policies on when it might include the race of suspects in its news releases.

“Our policy is clear: where we have a picture in which a suspect’s face is clearly visible we will not attach a racial descriptor to it,” spokesman Mark Pugash told me. “We want to go with the best possible evidence and a good clear photo is always best.

“If there is no clear picture, we will go with the description given to police by witnesses or victims,” Pugash said, adding that the security camera images of the suspect sought in the July 30 article did not provide a clear image of the suspect.

In such cases when photos are not available or of poor quality, police news releases may well state that a suspect is white, black, brown or use other racialized descriptors that could aid in a member of the public identifying the suspect. Indeed in looking through the archive of police news releases, you can find all such descriptions.

Like the Star, police policy calls for avoiding vague descriptions of suspects. “The information we put out has to enable someone to recognize someone,” Pugash said.

Of course, much of this is subjective. What police regard as a full description may not rise to the level required by the Star. The Star’s newsroom must always be aware of our own policy and values in determining whether there is justification in reporting the race of suspects and not automatically include such information simply because police have put it in a news release.

Certainly, as a news organization committed to equal dignity for all, the Star bears considerable responsibility to guard against reinforcing unfair racial stereotypes.",[],780,0.910752025079813

It depicts a Norman Rockwell-like idealized view of the newsroom of the “Evening Star” in 1899, when the legendary Joseph E. Atkinson was at the helm as publisher and proprietor. It shows about a dozen journalists – men in waistcoats, bowties and eyeshades – sitting at wooden tables, pencils in hand, with newspapers and books strewn about. A lone woman in a long dress, her hair in a topknot, walks among them carrying a stack of papers.

On the wall hangs a poster adorned with gold stars and words that proclaim the mission of “A Paper for the People”: “Brightness, Accuracy, Enterprise.”

I had an opportunity to see this piece of art only recently. Given my role for the past nine years as “guarantor of accuracy” on the many platforms on which the Star publishes these days, it delighted me so to see this image that paints a picture of the importance of accuracy all those 117 years ago, when Atkinson was building his newspaper.

I thought about it this week on reading a new study on what makes people trust and rely on the news. The central finding of this report, done by the U.S.-based Media Insight Project, a collaboration of the American Press Institute and the Associated Press NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, was unsurprising: Accuracy is the single most critical reason why people trust a news organization.

“Accuracy is the paramount principle of trust,” the study states. “Eighty-five per cent of Americans rate it as extremely or very important that news organizations get the facts right, higher than any other general principle.”

The study also found that transparency (defined as the idea that news organizations explain the way they gather and report the news) is very important to building trust. So to is “balance,” defined as “reporting that provides different views.” Readers also highly value timeliness (that a news report provide you with the latest news and information), and clarity (that a report be concise and gets to the point.)

Indeed, all of that does not sound a whole lot different from the imperative that the 1899 Evening Star provide brightness, accuracy and enterprise.

This study does reveal information important to today’s media business facing a revenue squeeze as advertisers spend more with digital giants such as Facebook and Google: When readers trust a news organization they “engage” with it in ways that matter to the future of the news business.

“Those news consumers especially concerned with trustworthiness are also the most likely to report that they take valuable actions — such as paying for news, spreading news to friends, and following the source on social platforms.

“Trust is an important differentiator for building an audience.”

While the report’s central thesis seems to me to be old news, there is much interesting research in the report about how audiences gauge the trustworthiness of news on new digital platforms, including websites, apps and social media.

It tells us that the rise of social media, in particular, has contributed to public distrust in media.

“When it comes to trust, many people who receive news from these social media platforms consume it with skepticism,” it says. “Social media news consumers do not generally trust the news they see there.”

I have been following media credibility studies since 1985 when I was a reporter for the Star sent to API for a professional development seminar. On our agenda that week was a then brand-new research report done by the American Society of Newspaper Editors titled, “Newspaper Credibility: Building Reader Trust: A National Study.”

I have never forgotten what I took away from that illuminating session: the reality that if journalists mess up such basics as spelling names correctly readers really do wonder what else we got wrong.

A multitude of studies have since made clear that the media has a deepening credibility problem. This report again finds low levels of confidence in all media.

As with many previous studies, it also points to a time-honored means of building trust: publishing corrections when we are wrong.

“Several people said that owning up to mistakes and drawing attention to errors or mistakes can show consumers that a source is accountable and dedicated to getting it right in the long term,” it states.

As “Kimberly,” one of the women interviewed for this report, stated, “We all make mistakes. If an outlet is wrong and is transparent about it and they screwed up, if they say I messed up and take ownership that makes me trust you more.”

Indeed, trust matters. Always has, and always will.",[],770,0.809637687493713

The Star now publishes its content in the paper, on its website, thestar.com; on its new tablet app, Star Touch; and also on its mobile app. While not all content is always published on all these “platforms,” all content can potentially be published in any of these ways. That fact applies to articles written by staff and also to content submitted for publication by readers.

Given this reality of multi-platform publishing, I was quite surprised to receive three requests in recent weeks from readers seeking to have their published letters to the editor removed from the Star’s website. One of the letters was published in 2010, another in 2011 and the third, last month. All expressed views on matters of public concern.

Two of these readers contend that they did not know the letters they submitted for publication would not only be published in the Star’s print editions but also online. Now, they tell me, they do not want these letters — and their names — coming up in Google searches. One letter writer suggests that online publication of her letter violates her privacy rights.

While hardly a week goes by that someone does not ask the Star to make information about them that was published previously on our website disappear from the Internet, these recent requests to delete letters to the editor are a new twist.

The Star generally does not delete what it publishes online — what is known as “unpublishing.” Our policy is clear and firm: “The Star does not unpublish content from our websites or archives, except in some rare circumstances.” Those “rare circumstances” are generally legal reasons and always demand consultation with the Star’s editor, managing editor and newsroom lawyer.

Unpublishing for rare reasons is indeed rare: In nearly nine years in this role, I can count on one hand the number of times when we have removed published information.

Like most other news organizations, the Star’s unpublishing policy is rooted in the view that the website — our digital archive of what’s been published — is a matter of public record and that it is unethical to make content simply disappear because someone does not want to see an article in which they are named turn up in a Google search.

It is worth knowing also that in this time when news and information is shared widely on social media, commented on, and cached on the web, it is virtually impossible to make words or images disappear entirely from the digital realm.

Clearly the long lifespan and easy accessibility of digital news and information has created new issues for news organizations and sources. The Star has given this issue serious consideration. It does take steps to update online articles and correct any inaccuracies in a transparent way. If we report on people charged with crimes and those charges are later dropped or those named were acquitted, we will note the outcome of the charges in bold type at the top of the article, understanding that a report of a criminal charge is a grave concern to the person involved.

So what about these unusual requests to unpublish letters to the editor that were submitted – and signed — by readers eager to see their views expressed in the Star. Indeed, given that the Star publishes about 12 to 15 of more than 100 letters submitted each day, most readers see it as somewhat of a coup to have their letter selected for publication.

I have spoken about this with the Star’s letters editor and the editorial page editor who is responsible for the Letters page. We all agree we cannot see any valid grounds for unpublishing published letters.

While these people seeking to have their letters taken down may well have since altered their views as expressed in those letters, or, as one of them told us, faced some professional repercussions for having expressed political views, I don’t think the Star can simply make those letters disappear as if they were never published.

Nor can I accept the argument that those letters were submitted for publication in the newspaper and the Star did not make clear that they could be published online as well — or that this is some sort of privacy issue because explicit permission to publish online was not sought and given. Given that the Star has been publishing readers’ letters online for many years now and this news organization is publicly transparent that it publishes on many platforms, I cannot see the need to state this explicitly or obtain explicit approval.

Indeed, we operate in a multi-platform digital age in which publishing has long since moved beyond printing words on paper.",[],800,0.8912802403530218

While one can’t go there these days without evoking smirks about the sexually explicit 50 Shades of Grey, the fact remains that many aspects of journalistic ethics are not a black and white matter.

And certainly the most intriguing and challenging ethical dilemmas of journalism often involve those many shades of grey.

My job, indeed that of all journalists, would be so much easier if journalistic standards and ethics were always a clear-cut matter of “Thou shalt do this, Thou shalt not do that.”

It is rarely that simple.

The reality of the complexity of journalism ethics in our ever-evolving digital era is the guiding principle of an important new ethics initiative presented last week at the annual Online News Association conference held in Los Angeles and attended by more than 2,000 journalists from across North America.

The “Build Your Own Ethics Code” project, led by veteran journalist Thomas Kent, standards editor of The Associated Press, involved more than 20 journalists working together for more than two years and soliciting input from many more journalists throughout North America.

The initiative is rooted in the premise that beyond a few fundamental and unassailable principles, journalistic ethics cannot be cast in stone and that policy and practice can — and does — vary across news organizations and among individual journalists.

That doesn’t mean anything goes. Or, that journalists should just make their own rules as they go along. After establishing four fixed points of journalistic values, the “BYO” ethics project provides a digital tool that guides journalists to customize their own codes of conduct based on a range of “building blocks” to consider in ethical decision-making.

First, the important fixed points of journalistic ethics. These are non-negotiable – indeed “black and white” fundamentals of all journalism, the core of every one of the dozens and dozens of journalistic standards code I have looked at in recent years.

These are:

Tell the truth. Journalists are honest, accurate, truthful and fair. We give people opportunity to respond to critical allegations, correct our errors, clearly distinguish fact from opinion in all content and “do not distort or fabricate facts, imagery, sound or data.”

Avoid conflicts of interest. Journalists avoid any conflict of interest that undermines our ability to report fairly. And, the ethics guide states, “disclose to your audience any unavoidable conflicts or situational factors that may validly affect your judgment of our credibility.”

Community. Respect our audiences and those we report about. The guide states: “Consider how your work and its permanence may affect the subjects of your reporting, your community and, since the Internet knows no boundaries, the larger world.”

Professional Conduct: Don’t plagiarize; keep your promises to sources, readers and your community.

Beyond those basics, the project encourages thought and discussion to determine where we stand as news organizations and as individual journalists on more than 40 specific issues including confidential sources, covering children and how we handle information gathered on social media.

“We started with the recognition that the journalism profession encompasses ever more people, philosophies and technologies,” Kent says. “There are many definitions these days of a ‘journalist,’ making it more important than ever for journalists to be clear about who they are and what they stand for.

“We believe the best hope for convincing all journalists to adopt and live by an ethics code is to give them ownership and flexibility in creating one.”

Steve Buttry, a Louisiana State University journalism professor and a well-travelled newsroom journalism trainer who was involved in the project from the outset, says the BYO code recognizes that journalists are rarely unanimous in our views on ethics policies and practice. He sees great value in the debate and discussion this new tool enables.

“As I’ve said many times, good ethical decisions don’t come from good rules but from many good conversations about ethics,” Buttry wrote in a recent blog post about the online ethics project.

While this initiative is geared to journalists, I think it is instructive for our audiences as well. It is well worth checking out to learn more about the many shades of grey of journalism ethics.

Just as fabrication is the cardinal sin of those who write the news, manipulating pictures is the zero-tolerance transgression of those who photograph the news.

As a reader, you must know with all certainty that what you see published in the newspaper and online is indeed what the journalist’s camera saw.

This core ethic of photojournalism has been the subject of much discussion in newsrooms around the globe this week after The Associated Press announced it “severed ties” with a Pulitzer Prize-winning freelance photographer who digitally altered an image he captured in Syria last year.

As the Star reported Thursday, the AP said photographer Narciso Contreras told editors he manipulated a digital picture of a Syrian rebel fighter taken last September, using software to remove a colleague’s video camera from the lower left corner of the image.

While the Star is an AP client and uses its photos daily, it did not publish this photo.

Contreras was part of the AP team awarded a Pulitzer last year for powerful news images of the war in Syria. All of his photos have now been removed from AP’s publicly available archive.

While some judge the news service’s reaction to be overly harsh, arguing that the photo altering did not alter the meaning of the image, it was a clear violation of the AP’s ethics code regarding the truth and accuracy of images. And while I imagine it wasn’t easy to reveal this ethical breach to the world, the AP’s transparency and accountability here is commendable — a model for media organizations on owning up to journalistic lapses.

Taras Slawnych, the Star’s visuals editor, agreed totally with the AP’s call on this ethical transgression: “The Star would never do that to a news photo,” he told me. “The integrity of photos has to be there. If you cross that ethical line and alter what’s real in an image you lose credibility.”

The Star’s ethics policy holds our visual journalists (those who shoot still photos and video) to the same standards of accuracy, fairness and transparency as all other Star journalists. While the code says that digital manipulation is permissible to improve technical quality (colour, contrast and basic sharpening), it makes clear that “any alteration or enhancement that renders a photo inaccurate or misleading is forbidden.”

While news photos in the Star “document reality,” sometimes feature stories are accompanied by “photo illustrations” that take creative liberties with images. The Star’s policy stipulates these must be labelled as such so readers clearly understand the image has been constructed.

I have no doubt all of the Star’s staff photographers understand and hold true to this professional ethic. So too do the Star’s photo editors know that electronic manipulation of news photos is verboten.

But, given that the Star and news organizations everywhere increasingly publish photos obtained from many outside sources, including social media, “citizen journalists” and “handout photos” from sources, there’s greater need to ensure the authenticity of photos before publishing them.

“There is always a chance that a submitted photo is not truthful. We must take steps to verify and ask ‘is this image real, is it truthful?’” Slawnych said, noting that today’s electronic tools make altering images easier than ever.

So how do these standards square with the controversy over a handout real estate photo of a Mississauga mansion up for auction published recently in the Star? As Susan Pigg, the Star’s real estate reporter, wrote last week, the “show-stopping photo” was taken with a wide-angle lens that appears to double the length of the home’s cobblestone driveway. The photographer hired by the real estate agent also acknowledged to Pigg that the photo is a “blending” of a few different exposures to capture the home in its best light.

While such electronic manipulation is common practice in advertising and marketing, and also some magazines, it is not in line with the Star’s photo standards, Slawnych told me. Still, like Slawnych, I don’t have concerns of a significant lapse on the Star’s part here.

I think most readers will understand that handout MLS listing photos are advertising and marketing tools — not photojournalism — and what you see is rarely exactly what you get. As Pigg so aptly put it in her story about the photo controversy: “those glitzy real estate photos are meant to sell a dream, and a home.”

But, given that this photo was published in the Star’s news pages to illustrate a story about the auction of the monster home, I am concerned that there was no photo credit included to indicate it was a handout marketing photo. While this was an unintended omission, readers needed that to clearly understand this glossy image was a realtor’s photo intended to enhance reality.

For the Star, the reality is that both words and images must document truth, however unvarnished.",[],804,0.9268583510700403

In the decade I taught at Ryerson University’s journalism school my students understood that no matter how brilliant their reporting and writing, if they messed up a name, they got an automatic F on that assignment. That’s a common policy of most journalism schools.

In the Star’s newsroom, we don’t hand out failing grades for misspelled, mixed-up names. But we do publish corrections.

If the Star gets a given or surname wrong, whether in the newspaper or online, we always correct. That is a fundamental undertaking of the Star’s corrections practice.

Getting names right has long been considered “the bedrock measure of accuracy” in journalism. Correcting when we make mistakes matters greatly both to those whose names we get wrong and to readers.

Every media credibility study I’ve looked at indicates that readers link credibility with basic accuracy and believe that getting names right is a significant indication of the overall accuracy of the journalist and the news organization.

We well know it’s a fact that if we get your name wrong you’ll wonder what else we got wrong. That’s why double-checking names must be the most basic of fact-checking for journalists.

But even the most careful journalists can make mistakes with names. Of 198 corrections published in the Star in the first half of this year, 58 were for wrong names. That’s 29 per cent of all corrections and tracking upward from last year when 100 of 415 newspaper corrections (just under 25 per cent) were for incorrect names.

We also made 316 online-only corrections in those six months, a great many for incorrect names.

I can’t imagine anyone here would disagree that’s too many incorrect names making it into the Star. Clearly, the Star could enhance its accuracy record considerably by making even more concerted efforts across the newsroom to ensure all first and last names are stated and spelled correctly.

I can assure you no journalist sets out to mangle someone’s name. A recent Canadian research study, “Verification as a Strategic Ritual: How journalists retrospectively describe processes for ensuring accuracy” found that the newspaper journalists interviewed about their methods of verifying information before publication all reported that they always took steps to ensure their subjects’ names were correct.

“An almost universal practice among participants is asking sources to spell their own name to ensure correct spelling, either at the beginning or the end of the interview,” stated the study published in February’s Journalism Practice.

As the study states, these journalists said they regarded an mistake in someone’s name as “a very visible error that can have implications for professional credibility.”

The Star’s error-tracking data leads me to two conclusions about how and why journalists get names wrong: Some do indeed fail in the basic requirement to verify the name and its spelling with the source. More often, they make mistakes when inputting names to their computers — your basic “typo” that’s subsequently not caught in their self-editing and the overall newsroom editing process.

Most mistakes in the Star start with writers. Our error data indicates that of the 198 corrections overall from January through June, 139 errors are classified as writing errors by reporters (100), columnists (19), freelance writers (16), editorial writers (2) and letter writers (2).

With newsroom restructuring resulting in fewer copy editors in the newsroom (and indeed in every newsroom throughout North America) there’s a strong case to be made that every writer must learn techniques to become their own best editor.

In coming weeks, I’ll be working with the newsroom to put together training sessions to help writers better catch their own errors and ensure that all writers have access to accuracy checklists. Such checklists have been proven to make a considerable difference in minimizing errors in names and other such basic facts. Simply reading our work back to ourselves doesn’t work in catching many errors — especially typos — because as Joseph T. Hallinan writes in Why We Make Mistakes, “By and large, we see what we expect to see.”

Whatever steps the newsroom and individual journalists take to minimize mistakes, some errors are inevitable given journalism’s deadline driven realities.

That’s why I make this pledge to you: If the Star gets your name wrong, we will publish a correction.",[],722,0.8934757479127413

McQuaig told you the number came from Canadians for Tax Fairness. What she didn’t tell you is that she is a member of that group’s advisory board.

Is that information that should be disclosed to readers? Is this a conflict of interest, as a reader who brought this to my attention suggested?

I don’t see a conflict issue here. McQuaig is a monthly opinion columnist for the Star, not a reporter. As such, she has wide latitude to express views informed by her own extensive expertise, interests and involvements.

Unlike news reporters who, according to the Star’s policy manual, must be seen to be “fair-minded fact-finders” and should not be “both actors and critics” on public issues, columnists — especially freelancers — have more leeway for involvement in public issues.

Still, there is a need for columnists and other Op-Ed writers to be transparent and make clear to readers any personal involvement in issues they write about.

Certainly McQuaig’s longtime interest in economic justice is no secret. A prolific author, she’s written nine books on politics and economics, including six national bestsellers. As her column credit note states, her most recent book, co-authored with Neil Brooks, is called The Trouble with Billionaires: How the Super-Rich Hijacked the World and How We Can Take It Back.

Nor, I am assured, was the writer attempting to hide her role with the tax fairness group. She simply overlooked mentioning her connection to the group that she is loosely affiliated with and in which she has no financial interest. And online the article linked to the organization’s website where McQuaig is listed as a member of the national advisory council.

Still, Editorial Page Editor Andrew Phillips decided the column should include some acknowledgement of McQuaig’s involvement with the group. To that end, the credit note at the end of the column has been amended to make that fact clear.

“Full disclosure is always best,” said Phillips, who like me does not regard this as a conflict issue. “If anything, adding a note here is an excess of caution.”

I think that was the right call. As was a similar call Phillips made this week for fuller disclosure on an online Op-Ed article exploring the Toronto casino debate written by Clyde W. Barrow, director of the Center for Policy Analysis at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth.

Barrow’s piece was critical of a University of Toronto, Martin Prosperity Institute study of the economic impact of a downtown casino in Toronto. Following a reader complaint that the article did not make clear Barrow’s past involvement with the casino industry, and upon further questioning of the author to determine the extent of any such involvement, the credit line on the article was amended to tell you: “He has conducted market feasibility studies for companies considering building casinos in New England.”

Op-Ed writers are not meant to be unbiased bystanders. They write to express informed views rooted in their own expertise and experience. They express their own views, not those of the news organization.

It is up to you to assess the positions put forth in Op-Ed pieces. But to do so, you must be given any relevant information that might help you gauge the credentials and biases of those given space to provide their perspectives on newsworthy public issues. The Star can’t know all the affiliations of all Op-Ed writers and expects them to disclose any interests they have in a subject.

“Op-ed writers aren’t supposed to be objective or to have no stake in the subjects they’re writing about,” Nicholas Goldberg, Los Angeles Times editorial page editor, said last fall in an interview with Media Matters, a media monitoring website.“When a writer does have a particular relationship to his subject that is not immediately apparent to the reader, it is important to disclose that so that the reader can evaluate the argument intelligently.”

Media Matters interviewed Goldberg and other U.S. editorial page editors after reporting that the Wall Street Journal had failed to disclose that 10 Op-Eds it published during the U.S. election campaign were written by advisers to presidential candidate Mitt Romney without any disclosure of that vital information.

A former New York Times editor called such an egregious failure to disclose “shameless.” Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, said: “Not disclosing is inexcusable.

“We are pretty careful here to disclose any affiliation,” he added.

Clearly, in this digital age of radical transparency, great care must be taken to assure the fullest disclosure possible.",[],775,0.9243252748569285

In the literature, “fairness in journalism” is generally an abstract notion, difficult to define; it is considered “complex,” “illusive,” “paradoxical,” “subjective.”

In the Star’s newsroom, what’s fair is neither abstract nor subjective. The core standard of fairness here is clear and concrete: any subject of potentially harmful factual allegations must be given opportunity to respond.

As Bert Bruser, the Star’s lawyer, tells some journalist in the newsroom almost every day, getting the other side is “the essence of fairness” in line with the legal requirements of responsible journalism as they have evolved in recent decades.

In last week’s column I told you about an egregious lapse of the Star’s standards of accuracy and fairness that resulted in the Star publishing false allegations about MPP Margarett Best. Proper due diligence was not done here.

While the reporter had attempted to reach Best, at no time did he state explicitly that he was working on a story that would report she was vacationing in Mexico while on medical leave from Queen’s Park. Had he done so, it’s quite likely he would have learned that was flat-out wrong and the Star would not have published the story.

In light of this serious lapse, the newsroom is taking steps to ensure that everyone fully understand due diligence and fairness. In coming weeks, Bruser, along with Kevin Donovan, the Star’s award-winning investigations editor, will lead mandatory training sessions for all reporters.

Donovan and his “I-team” are standard-bearers for the degree of due diligence fairness demands. Having talked extensively about this with him and Bruser, I expect many reporters have much to learn from them about the extent they must go to ensure they meet the standards of fairness laid down by the law and the Star’s policies.

I-team exposés of wrongdoing most often put their subjects in a negative light. But it is standard operating procedure for I-team reporters to make certain those subjects are given every opportunity to respond to harmful allegations before publication,

These reporters routinely make contact with the subjects of their investigations early in their reporting, often sending emails that lay out the explicit details of what they are looking into and what they hope to learn.

“Everyone is entitled to give their side of the story. I preach that on a daily basis,” Donovan told me this week. “Telling a person or organization about an allegation gives them the opportunity at the start to tell you that you have it wrong, partly wrong, or mostly right.

“Calling last minute doesn’t cut it. I often inform people or organizations on Day 1 of my investigation,” Donovan said. “People need to be told precisely what it is you are calling about.

“It is the fair and responsible thing to do.”

It is also the degree of diligence required to meet legal standards of fairness. Canada’s 2009 Supreme Court ruling on “responsible communication in the public interest” stipulates that “it is inherently unfair to publish defamatory allegations of fact without giving the target an opportunity to respond.”

That’s a clear definition of fairness, but not really new. As Bruser reminded me, this standard was expressed forcefully in law some three decades ago when the Toronto Sun lost a libel suit brought by then cabinet minister John Munro after the Sun reported wrongly that Munro had been involved in illegal stock trading.

Ontario Supreme Court Justice Mr. John Holland stated then that when “the paper has the goods on the person targeted in the story, it is basic and necessary that the person be confronted with the story so that his reaction be obtained.”

Justice Holland aptly pointed out that getting the other side could indeed cause a story to be “discarded,” preventing publication of an incorrect story. Certainly that would have happened with the Best story.

Through the years, Donovan, working closely with Bruser on many Star investigations, has come to understand the value of reaching out early to those he is investigating and being explicit about the allegations he is pursuing.

Doing so makes for “a better, more responsible, more solid story,” Donovan said.

In my books, that’s fairness in journalism.

That attitude is so 2010. Back then, when I wrote about “the Twitter transformation,” I told you that some news veterans were disdainful of the then relatively new digital tool that allows real-time sharing of information in 140 characters or less.

Certainly within the “twitterverse” you can still find the trivial (yes, some do still share what they ate for breakfast) and the titillating. And too much that is mean-spirited. But hasn’t that always been the case for any medium of communication?

For journalists and news organizations, Twitter is now a vital tool, especially when news breaks. It allows journalists to tell you almost instantaneously what we learn, whether on the scene or by connecting directly to participants and witnesses.

Yes, instant news does bring real risks of getting it wrong. I’ll get to that. But I do so believing Twitter is an important medium for journalism. What’s at issue is figuring out how to use it in a way that’s aligned with journalistic values of verification, accuracy and transparency.

These questions will be explored in Toronto next week in a “J-Talks” session, sponsored by the Canadian Journalism Foundation. Headlining the panel is Andy Carvin, NPR’s senior social media strategist and author of the recently released Distant Witness: Social Media, the Arab Spring and a Journalism Revolution. As the Star’s Michelle Shephard writes in today’s World Weekly section, Carvin became known as “the man who tweets revolutions” when he tweeted thousands of daily, first-hand, live reports from citizens at the heart of the Arab Spring.

The J-Talks session also features two other veteran journalists: digital pioneer Mathew Ingram, senior media writer for GigaOM, and Esther Enkin, the recently appointed ombudsman for CBC English services. I am moderating the session.

Entitled “The Twitter Effect: Is Journalism Still Able to Get it Right?” this panel came about in the aftermath of the Newtown shooting tragedy when much false information circulated within mainstream news websites and social media. Most egregious: many reported the wrong shooter, naming Ryan Lanza when it was actually his brother Adam. (Happily, due to the newsroom’s diligence, the Star did not report this erroneous information.)

Then, as was the case in just about any major breaking news story in recent years, many journalists and news organizations gave readers false information in the rush to report at Twitter speed. Sometimes that wrong stuff was reported on Twitter first, other times by mainstream means first. In all cases, it was amplified in the echo chambers of Twitter.

And each time, Twitter took the blame for the downfall of journalistic standards.

I think blaming this new medium is too simplistic.

Certainly journalists must figure out how to reconcile the conflict of reporting breaking stories in real time with the essential journalistic value of verification, which means “getting what happened down right.”

But, as the J-Talks panellists tell me, we need to do that within the reality that getting what happened down right when news breaks has always been somewhat messy.

Even when journalists reported for a daily news cycle, we understood the truth of the now clichéd statement that “news is the best available version of the truth.” In the chaos of reporting breaking news on deadline, that meant we sometimes didn’t have everything right when it came time to publish. We updated in next-day stories and published corrections.

Now that the news cycle never ends and Twitter can mean reporting on minute-to-minute deadlines, what should verification in journalism entail?

Does it mean telling you only what we know with absolute certainty? Or can it mean being transparent with you about what we are unsure about but trying to verify? Do we need a more effective corrections process for real-time news?

These are critical questions as journalism evolves and embraces new tools, particularly for legacy news organizations such as the Star where credibility matters much. Long-held standards of verification have served readers well here.

Those standards boil down to a simple dictum, still well worth a tweet for thought: “When in doubt, don’t report.”

In this digital age of texting, tweeting and time-stressed journalism, has proper spelling gone the way of hot type?

As language evolves, should spelling too? Should the language of texting become common parlance? Are u ok with “1” for “won,” “L8r” for “later,” “UR” instead of “you’re”? A heart for “love?”

In a provocative essay published in this month’s Wired magazine, entitled “It’s Tyme to Let Luce” writer and professor Anne Trubek argues against the “outdated dogma” of standardized spelling. She contends it’s time to “loosen our idea of correct spelling.”

Language evolves, she said, “and spelling evolves, too, as we create new words, styles and guidelines.

“Consistent spelling was a great way to ensure clarity in the print era,” she said. “But with new technologies, the way that we write and read (and search and data-mine) is changing, and so must spelling.”

While Trubek presents a compelling argument for the “terrible mess” of the English language and its many inconsistencies in spellings, and tells us that the notion of consistent spelling is a “fairly recent invention” (albeit, an invention dating back at least to the 1770s), I can’t imagine the conventions of proper spelling disappearing from journalism any time soon.

Certainly, spelling does matter at the Star. Our readers remind us constantly that spelling matters.

Misspellings and typos in the newspaper and online can provoke more passionate reader indignation than just about any other journalistic transgression. Sometimes disproportionately so.

“You subject your readers to multiple spelling mistakes,” a reader recently told me in an email criticizing the Star for misspelling “anesthesiologist.”

“Your newspaper is supposed to be a model, not a source of mistakes which are careless and avoidable,” he wrote. “Journalism is not only about what you write but how you present it to the reader.

“This is totally unacceptable for any type of publication, spell checker or no spell checker.”

This week, a reader who identified himself as “a retired professor living in Portugal” emailed me about a Star sports blog in which the possessive “its” was misspelled as the contraction “it’s” three out of four times in the piece. Another reader wrote this week to point out that a reporter wrote “sighting” when she meant “citing.”

In recent weeks, readers have pointed out that the Star wrote about a movie “premier” instead of a “premiere” and referred to the “forward” of a book instead of the “foreword.”

Clearly homonyms — those words that sound the same, but have different meanings and spellings — are a challenge. To sometimes hilarious effect (not affect!), the Star has confused stationary and stationery, fazed and phased, principal and principle, aide and aid, pored and poured. These commonly misspelled words always need double-checking.

Is this just niggling nitpicking? Trubek believes the reason we have rules or rather, “arbitrary contrivances” governing spelling is simply “snobbery.” She argues that new technologies, such as smart phones and tablets, are “speeding the adoption of more casual forms of communication.”

But certainly people expect more from journalists than the casual newspeak of texts and 140-character tweets. As my son, 19, chided me in a message he texted in response to my hastily typed, error-ridden text message: “Nice grammar. I thought U were an editor.”

Media credibility studies consistently tell us that spelling errors erode journalism’s credibility. We know public trust depends on journalists getting the details right.

I don’t see how any journalist can buy into Trubek’s argument that correct spelling no longer matters.

As Mallary Jean Tenore of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies aptly concluded in an online report about Trubek’s essay, “journalists value accuracy.”

“We want to get our facts straight and spell words right — not just to avoid corrections but to offer as much clarity as possible to the reader,” she wrote.” Once you start using misspelled words — even if they’re commonly accepted in the world of text messages and instant messages — you lose a segment of your audience that may not be as familiar with these words. “

Even Wired published a rebuttal to Trubek’s piece written by one of its own copy editors.

“What exactly is it about digital media that demands the abolition of spelling rules?” Lee Simmons wrote. “Are we saying that professional news sites should spell words in any way that strikes their mood or fancy?”

In her essay, Trubek asks: “Who shud tell us how to spel?” answering with, “Let’s make our own rules.”

But she also seems to undermine her own thesis: “Standardized spelling enables readers to understand writing, to aid communication and ensure clarity. Period.”

Indeed. That’s why accurate spelling matters.

Almost immediately, online commenters began to weigh in on news about the controversial pay hike debated for months throughout the town: “They have got to be kidding, a 43% raise,” said one. Echoed another, “What were they thinking, taking 43%.”

Not long after, reporter Kate Allen, who had filed this news to the web in haste, realized she had erred and misunderstood the actual numbers councillors had voted on. In fact, it was an 18.6 per cent raise for councillors and 16 per cent for the mayor. Allen informed her editor, Dave Beer, and the online story was changed. So too was the “updated” home page headline, which now told a different story altogether: “Whitchurch-Stouffville councillors back down on massive pay raise.”

If incorrect information is published online and subsequently changed, did a mistake actually occur? Should readers be told what was initially wrong? Or, in the digital news universe, do updates replace corrections?

Reader Val Dodge, who read the two online versions of the Star’s report — and sent me screen shots of both — told me he was “disturbed” the Star had not acknowledged the original error.

“I think it is incumbent upon the Star to openly acknowledge online errors, especially ones as egregious as this one,” Dodge said. “It may be acceptable to silently fix a misspelled word or misplaced punctuation, but silently changing a headline so that it means the exact opposite of its original wording is far beyond what I would consider acceptable.”

This reader is correct. What happened here was not acceptable.

The Star’s accuracy and corrections policy applies to all content on all platforms. It says that errors, in print or online, must be corrected clearly, promptly and prominently. It also states, “Building trust in the digital world demands that the Star is seen to be transparent.”

In this case, readers needed to be clearly informed in an online correction that the first report was wrong. As David Cash, CAO and town manager of Whitchurch-Stouffville, said in an email: “The town is very concerned about this error as it immediately generated a number of comments on the website that left people with incorrect information, which further perpetuated the error.”

I knew nothing of this until I received Dodge’s email. The original story had been changed in the newsroom and the public editor’s office was not informed — as we should have been.

For almost 40 years now, since the creation of its “Bureau of Accuracy” the Star’s public editor (long titled the ombudsman) has had responsibility for determining and publishing daily corrections.

Like much else that is necessarily changing as newspapers evolve to become fully digital, the Star’s centralized print-centric corrections process must also evolve to reflect the reality of 24/7 publishing in which every journalist in the newsroom can easily amend/fix/update/correct/publish online content.

Digital content is published, updated and amended (necessarily) around the clock. That means everyone in the newsroom must take responsibility for ensuring that the Star is as vigorous about correcting and acknowledging online errors as we have long been in print.

Star Editor Michael Cooke sent a note to the newsroom this week to make this clear to all.

In recent months, I’ve grown increasingly concerned about the Star’s level of transparency about online errors, having come across far too many examples of the newsroom “fixing” stories without acknowledging mistakes.

I know no one likes making mistakes. And certainly, some journalists are reluctant to own up to errors. But we owe it to our readers to be clear about what we’ve corrected online, lest we create confusion about what is accurate.

Not all journalists agree. Some contend that mistakes online are rectified when a story is republished with corrected information. They suggest that the very ease of online publishing means there is little more need for actual corrections that tell readers what was first wrong.

That’s not the view of reputable news organizations that understand the vital importance of credibility. I’ve spent considerable time learning about online corrections policies of various newsrooms around the world including the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, NPR and the BBC.

The New York Times strives to correct and acknowledge online errors regardless of how little time the inaccurate information was online. “The policy is to correct and be transparent about what was corrected when an error is made regardless of whether it’s been online for five seconds, five minutes or five hours,” public editor Arthur Brisbane told an ombudsman conference last spring.

All the organizations I consulted share the conviction that transparency demands we should not “scrub” digital content, that is, just fix it and hope no one notices.

Because, of course, someone always notices.

Many readers wondered if there was some sort of Freudian slip in misspelling “marital” as “martial” in the first paragraph of a Jan 18 article about the perils of adultery in the marriage bed.

“The bed they practised their martial arts in? Bed for a court martial? I can't believe an editor let THAT one slip by!” commented W.J.R. Halyn.

Why do journalists make such silly mistakes? How indeed does an error that jumps out at readers slip through the Star’s editing process?

In search of greater insight and understanding into these persistent reader questions, I turned to two recently published books that delve deeply into the psychology and philosophy of our innate fallibility: Why We Make Mistakes, by Joseph T. Hallinan, a Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist, and Being Wrong, by Kathryn Schulz, also an award-winning journalist.

Though neither of these journalists writes specifically about media errors, their compelling insights into the nature of human error help explain how mistakes are made and why being wrong is inevitable in any endeavour in which mere mortals are involved.

Journalists are well aware that typos, grammar gaffes, misspellings and inaccuracies mar a news organization’s credibility and annoy its readers. I know that most writers take great care to double-check their work and editors aim to catch errors before they are published.

But, who among us — journalist or reader — has not had the experience of checking our work and missing our mistakes?

Hallinan, a former writer for the Wall Street Journal, tells us this is the human condition. His cites research indicating that even the most careful readers do not read every single letter, in every single word, in every single sentence.

That reality helps explains an error in his former newspaper that referred to a competition of British jesters who would be riding on unicorns. In fact, as the Journal’s subsequent correction noted, the clowns were to ride unicycles.

“For anyone interested in mistakes, the corrections columns of newspapers often make delicious reading,” he notes.

Unicorn, unicycle, marital, martial. All too often, it is all the same to the human eye.

“It’s tempting to attribute mistakes like this to simple carelessness,” Hallinan writes. The reality is more complex however. Most people skim and miss some details.

And, he adds, “the more skilled we are, the more likely we are to skim.” That explains why even highly skilled editors miss mistakes.

“We see only what we expect to see,” Hallinan says. “Overlooked mistakes are so common that researchers have given them their own designation: they are called ‘proofreader’s errors’

“These humdrum errors reveal some interesting quirks about the way human perception works. Perception, above all, is economical. We notice some things and not others.”

As well, as something becomes more familiar we tend to notice less, not more and “we come to see things not as they are but as (we assume) they ought to be.

“We are blinded by the effects of habit and hubris and hobbled by a poor understanding of our own limitations. We don’t see all that we observe, and yet we sometimes ‘see’ things we don’t know we’ve seen.”

Schulz expresses a similar idea about how we look but do not see in Being Wrong, an engaging philosophical examination of the inevitability of human error.

“To be blind without realizing our blindness is, figuratively the situation all of us are in when we are in error,” she writes.

If this is so, should we simply give up and accept the inevitability of what readers perceive to be journalistic carelessness?

Of course not. While typos rooted in human error may indeed be somewhat inevitable in any publication, we can aim to minimize them. Both of these writers contend we must understand our innate fallibility to devise better methods to see clearly and catch our mistakes.

“It helps to second-guess, to play devil’s advocate with yourself,” Hallinan writes. “We all think we are above average. In this conceit lies the seeds of many mistakes.”

Hallinan points to professions such a pilots and anesthesiologists that have minimized life-threatening “human error” by devising checklists that acknowledge the possibility of mistakes and enhance awareness of what can go wrong.

Similar measures in newsrooms include accuracy checklists and production systems that assure all copy is read over by fresh eyes before publication. The reality is that such measures are often skipped in the rush to deadline and mistakes make it into print.

To minimize human error, Schulz suggests we need to be humble and know that what can go wrong often will go wrong: “If we want to try to eradicate error, we have to start by assuming that it is inevitable.”

Indeed, mistakes happen.

The day before, reader Bill Archibald emailed to inquire why the Star had devoted time and space to the story of Ludwig the cat who went missing at Pearson airport. Why, he asked, is a lost cat news?

In any given week, readers of the Star are apt to ask some variation of the essential questions at the heart of those emails: What is news? Who decides what the Star pays attention to — and what it ignores. What runs on Page 1 and on the home page of thestar.com?

Readers are quick to weigh in on what the Star covers as well as what it doesn’t cover.

I often hear from those of you who are disappointed that the Star did not cover an event in which you have a particular interest. For example, this week a reader wondered why he could not find news about the Princess Patricia’s Regiment anniversary celebrations in the Star.

Another longtime reader, a 70-year-old man who told me he was sexually abused in his childhood, wrote an impassioned letter imploring the Star to provide more coverage of the serious questions raised in the final report (released last December) of Ontario’s public inquiry into sexual abuse allegations in Cornwall.

The Oxford Canadian Dictionary defines news as “information about important or interesting recent events.” There’s broad scope in that for judgment about what is “important” — information you need to know — and what is “interesting” — stuff you might want to know.

Deciding what’s news is the core work of the media. As the renowned journalist and media critic Walter Lippman once said: “All the reporters in the world, working all the hours of the day, could not witness all the happenings in the world.”

Journalism is, by necessity, the art of selection, of deciding what matters and how to present that to audiences. While the Internet and the emergence of “citizen journalism” and social media have made it easier to connect and communicate within our global village, leading some to argue that journalism’s role as a “gatekeeper” is not necessary, there’s a case to be made that the barrage of accessible information makes the editor’s job of selection more vital.

The Star’s senior editors strive to provide a mix of what they believe readers need to know and what you might want to know. Clearly, on any given day, their news judgment won’t be in accord with that of all readers — or even all Star journalists. “Why is that news?” is a sentiment as apt to be expressed in the newsroom as in the public editor’s email box.

Indeed, such was the case with Thursday’s Page 1 play of Céline Dion’s $20 million new estate. For my part, I’m with reader Keung Lui who wrote: “I am happy for Céline and her 8-year-old son that they could afford a $20 million play house. But is this so-called news worth the front page of the Toronto Star? Don’t you have some real and more important news to report?”

How do journalists decide what is news? Is news simply determined by an editor’s whim, as expressed by the oft-cited cliché of the powerful editor who declares, “News is what I say it is.”

Textbook definitions of news that aim to teach aspiring journalists how to develop “news judgment” are of little practical use in the daily, and increasingly online, hourly, fray of deciding what’s news. For example, few editors ever consciously consider what one text tells us: “News is information about a break from the normal flow of events, an interruption in the unexpected” (practical translation: Dog bites man: not news. Man bites dog: news).

Stanley Walker, the famous editor of the now-defunct New York Herald Tribune defined news as the three W’s — “women, wampum and wrongdoing” (practical translation: sex, money and crime). That’s sexist, to be sure. How far off is it, though? Consider how those universal elements figure in many important and interesting news stories.

Journalism textbooks define the factors of newsworthiness as the impact of information on citizens, whether conflict and controversy are involved, timeliness, the prominence of those involved and proximity to the audience.

Novelty and oddity also factor in. Many successful editors, striving to appeal to readers, have long defined news as that which makes a reader say, “Gee whiz!”

For most journalists, deciding what’s news is instinctive, rooted in experience and their perceptions of what readers want. Practical factors such as space, reporting resources, the mix of hard news and softer features, the number of events competing for attention, as well as the availability of compelling photos to illustrate the news, are also at play.

All these theories aside, there is one overriding consideration that helps explain the daily puzzle of what is news: What’s newsworthy on a “slow news day” is far different than what you’ll read when a natural disaster happens or a parliamentary scandal breaks.

It’s a safe bet that Céline Dion’s water-park would not have made such a splash on the day a tsunami struck or there was a tidal wave of earth-shaking news.

The considerable distinction between news reporting and columnists' opinions in the Star is often not clear to readers, however. That's sometimes because the Star doesn't clearly indicate when an article is an opinion column. But there's also much misunderstanding about the scope of Star columnists.

Simply put, news is the unbiased, fair reporting of facts, gathered and verified by reporters. Columns are expressions of opinions about facts.

Among the most frequent subjects of complaint to the public editor's office is that some columnist or another at the Star is ""biased,"" ""unobjective"" or ""unfair."" The reality is that opinion columnists can indeed be biased, unobjective and yes, sometimes, unfair.

That's the nature of opinion journalism. Opinion columns are a columnist's arguments for a particular point of view. And vigorous argument is not necessarily fair and balanced, as you should expect the news to be.

As Clark Hoyt, public editor of The New York Times, told me in an email discussion about whether public editors should weigh in on the fairness of opinion columns: ""I think it is virtually impossible to judge the `fairness' of arguments made by a newspaper or those it licenses to offer their own opinions.

""Argument is almost by definition unfair, in the sense that one marshalls facts to support a conclusion, emphasizing some and de-emphasizing or ignoring others. Someone who disagrees with the conclusion almost always thinks that has been done unfairly.""

Columnists at the Star have wide latitude in articulating their opinions and the manner in which they express their views – however outrageous those views may seem to some. If I had a loonie for every time a reader told me he or she considered an opinion column in the Star to be ""unfair"" or ""offensive,"" I could escape dreary November and be sunning on the Mediterranean right now.

Instead, I'm in Montreal today, attending the annual conference of the Canadian Media Lawyers Association, also called Ad IDEM – Advocates in Defence of Expression in the Media. I tell you this because the core mission of this organization – standing up for the Charter right of freedom of expression given to all Canadians – is at the heart of a newspaper columnist's right to express opinions that some may find offensive.

As Justice Ian Binnie said in last year's Supreme Court ruling on fair comment: ""We live in a free country where people have as much right to express outrageous and ridiculous opinions as moderate ones. ... Public controversy can be a rough trade and the law needs to accommodate its requirements.""

Star columnists are guided by these legal freedoms, which include the obligation that opinions expressed in columns be based on fact. Like all journalists, opinion columnists must also abide by laws regarding libel and hate speech.

Columnists speak for themselves, not the newspaper (the views of the Star are expressed on the editorial page). That doesn't mean ""anything goes.""

The Star's columnists are subject to editorial oversight and this news organization's ethical standards. It's not unusual for columnists to alter what they have to say, or the manner in which they say it, at the behest of astute editors offering wise second thought.

Still, I'm often asked: ""Why did the editor let that in the paper?""

My answer: Generally, editors give columnists wide latitude in expressing their personal opinions in recognition both of the right to freedom of expression and journalistic traditions of what makes for a compelling column.

As Poets, Pundits and Wits, a collection of newspaper columns, tells us, columnizing is a ""self-indulgent"" occupation, and columnists have licence to be ""rude, reckless, silly and prejudiced.""

That same view was expressed by the recently deceased William Safire in a note to the New York Times' A.M. Rosenthal when Rosenthal became a columnist: ""As you cultivate the garden of controversy, burn the bridges of objectivity. Show me an even-handed columnist and I'll show you an odds-on favourite soporific.""

It's the right and the role – arguably, even the responsibility – of columnists to poke and provoke, enrage and offend. In doing so, the best columnists can make us think and reach our own conclusions about issues that matter to us.

Readers often ask me to weigh in on the ""fairness"" of opinion columns. I don't think it's fair to offer my opinion on a columnist's opinion. I do tell these readers that they have the right to express dissenting opinions through letters to the editor or online comments.

Certainly, I don't always agree with the opinions published in the Star.

But, as a defender of the right to free expression, I must defend the right to offend.

Food television.

Style expert Meredith Shaw and her husband, chef Rodney Bowers, are out to change that with their new self-shot cooking series, “Double Your Dish,” where they transform one base ingredient into two totally different dishes in their home kitchen. While Rodney takes the lead on the cooking side, Meredith flexes her food styling and sous chef skills, and also acts as camera operator.

Beyond the delicious food, the series is noteworthy because it signals a shift in the types of bodies that are seen on television, particularly food television. “It’s pretty cool to have a cooking show with two people in bigger bodies because I don’t think you see that very much,” says Shaw. Bowers’ experience backs that up: “In the past, I was told that I wouldn’t have my own cooking show because of my size, that it’s not something that networks or sponsors want.”

Where do you see the intersection between body positivity and love of cooking?

Shaw: Society puts a lot of guilt on enjoying food. I hope that through the food that we make, and the style that we do it in and our passion for what we’re doing, it allows for that intersection to be even stronger and to provide actual examples of it happening in real time.

Bowers: I’ve worked on many different television shows over the years as a guest cooking expert and I was often met with negative comments about being a larger man even when I was cooking healthier food. There was a weird dichotomy between a large man cooking and promoting healthier food. It sat with me for a while and I questioned how to deal with it, because I wanted to promote good, healthy, organic, balanced eating for everyone. On the flip side of that, when I would cook with lots of butter and meat, I’d get negative comments … associated specifically with my weight. I think it’s so important for people in larger bodies to show that food can be good and dynamic and tasty and healthy and fun. It doesn’t have to be associated with their body image. It can just be food that they’re cooking.

What kinds of recipes do you prepare on ‘Double Your Dish’?

Shaw: The series was inspired by our Instagram Lives in our kitchen, when we were preparing meals together. Once we were offered the show, we sat down, cracked a bottle of wine and said, “What do we want to cook? What do we want to show? What do we want to share with the country? What would be useful? What would be personal?” Rodney uses really simple, accessible ingredients and makes them so delicious, and shows that I — and the viewers at home — can do it, too.

Meredith, you’ve done a lot of great work for the body positivity moment. How did that start?

Shaw: I have always been in a bigger body and there was no word for that when I was growing up. There was no “curvy,” there was no sort of activism; it was “big-boned” or “fat.” I started off as a singer-songwriter and I had many a meeting with record executives — which I hope don’t happen now — where they’d say, “We love your voice, we love your song, but we basically don’t like what you look like.” That was hard to handle. I had a tough journey with it and I went down the wrong path for a while. I tried to be less than, tried to be smaller, and it didn’t work for me. That’s why I have such empathy and passion for helping other women through that, because it’s so much better on your own team. It’s so much better to love your body and to know that you are more than your body, and to know that your worth isn’t tied to the size of your body.

Rodney, have you had similar experiences?

Bowers: I think the anxiety and depression that can come with being overweight affects men as well. I definitely struggle with self-image when we’re talking about cooking food on TV. Producers have told me that it all came down to an image thing and it turned me off for a while, thinking that no matter how I present myself on camera there’s always going to be this stigma about my size that other people are going to hold me back for. But then you get over it and you prove them wrong.

Meredith, how did your experiences propel your work as a fashion expert?

Shaw: I think you can really express yourself with style; it’s a way of stepping into your purpose. If your closet is full of things that don’t fit and make you feel bad and shameful when you open it, get rid of that stuff and stock it with new things. I scream that from the rooftops as often as I can. I come at my role as a style expert from a real place of love and empathy as a result of my own experiences.

Ask Ellie,'Ellieadvice Columnistmon.',2020-07-13 00:00:00,"Q: I find dating after a divorce three years ago at 38, very confusing.

I grew up during so-called sexual freedom since birth control pills and other pregnancy prevention methods were easily available.

Some of my friends started having sex in their early teens. I had my first experience at 17, with a boyfriend I liked but certainly didn’t love.

The first half of my 20s were about experimenting. I didn’t like dope, but did like wine. Sex with a good-looking guy who treated me nicely was great!

Now, at 41, everything’s changed, at least in me. I have children, a boy of 12, a girl, 14. Their father has a girlfriend and though they think she’s nice, they find it difficult to see them hugging and kissing.

No way can I be that dating Mom who almost dances out the door on the arm of a man my kids don’t know, laughing too loudly at something “he” said.

(That’s how my daughter described a scene from a TV show that she said was “yucky.”)

Everyone says that dating online is the only way to meet a lot of guys and choose whom you want. But how can I be honest with my very curious, smart children if they ask me how I met someone new?

I feel like I’m a throwback to the mode of how my mother’s dating life must’ve been: Meeting someone at their mutual workplace, or the library, or church.

In fact, my ex and I met at our mutual workplace.

So how does a freedom-loving child born in 1981, who enjoyed the “entitlement” years of the millennial generation, now find a comfortable, responsible approach to single life and dating?

Specifically: How do I date in a way that I’m not embarrassed for my children to know about?

Fresh-Start Dater

A: Good for you for considering your kids first.

They’ve already had to adjust to their father’s relationship, and they’ll adjust to your dating, too, if you maintain your priorities.

Wisely, you haven’t rushed to dating apps or a dating site too soon.

But there’s no reason (outside of the pandemic’s restrictions) to miss being with friends and meeting new people with whom you share interests.

The availability through Zoom and other online platforms to join a gathering, and/or broaden your knowledge of something through a webinar, is a perfect start to “socializing.”

And after months of social isolation and home-school, it’s healthy for your children to see you enjoying a wider community online.

That exposure may initiate dating someone whom you meet online because you already have something in common.

Once you connect with someone, if a date is suggested, be open about how new this feels for you and how you want a slow introduction — e.g. taking a walk together.

If another date is going to happen, talk to your kids about it right away. Explain that it’s a very early friendship and you’re going to take time getting to know him.

Keep it simple, and open to the kids: e.g. a visit in a park nearby where the children can see you and get to you if they feel the need.

If there’s a negative reaction, discuss it with them immediately and reassure them that this is only a new friend for you, someone to talk together and share some ideas.

If there’s a more worrisome reaction, talk to a therapist yourself and if considered necessary, bring the children into the process.

That said, its popularity has been subject to the usual ups and downs associated with drink trends and, from about 1970 to 2010, it was a little less common, since many people had turned to vodka, rum and tequila cocktails like the Margarita, Piña Colada and Cosmopolitan. And, as often happens with drinks that aren’t in regular circulation, the quality of the Manhattans started to decline as a lot of bartenders simply forgot how to make one properly.

It’s an easy drink to make—whisky, sweet vermouth, bitters, stirred over ice and served in a cold glass with or without a cherry—but a lot of things can go wrong if you don’t understand a few basics.

First, like all drinks that are made with straight spirits, it needs to be stirred, so that it doesn’t wind up watery. Second, the bitters are essential. Third, splurge on a good Amarena cherry. Fourth, vermouth goes bad relatively quickly if it isn’t stored in the refrigerator. Finally, don’t be stingy with the vermouth.

Unless, that is, you’ve left your vermouth on a counter for a month, which was exactly what happened at a lot of bars in the vodka/tequila era. On top of that, a lot of people forgot the bitters since, even though a bottle of Angostura bitters sat on the back bar of many venues like a talisman or something, few of us understood how to use them. Bitters are often called the “salt and pepper” of the cocktail world and bartenders say that, quite often, if something is just a little off on a drink and they can’t figure out what, a dash of bitters will fix it.

These problems have largely been fixed in the past 10 to 15 years, thanks to the revival of traditional methods amongst bartenders who have been bringing back the classics.

Speaking of tradition, the first Manhattans would almost universally have been made with American rye whiskey but, since we’re doing 100-mile cocktails here and supporting local distilleries, we’re using a Canadian alternative, Stalk and Barrel’s Three Barrel Whisky ($34.95; LCBO 13323). Since it’s made just north of Toronto, we named it after the distillery’s location—in Concord.

The Concord

2 oz Stalk and Barrel whisky

¾ oz Haberdasher sweet vermouth (made in Prince Edward County)

2 dashes Angostura bitters

1 Amarena cherry (for garnish)

Method: Stir all ingredients (except the cherry) together over ice in a mixing glass for 45 seconds. Strain into a chilled coupe or martini glass. Add cherry.

NOTE: If you have trouble tracking down Haberdasher, Dillon’s Vermouth (also made in Ontario) is an alternative that’s available at the LCBO. And there are plenty of Ontario craft whisky options, but we wanted to shine a light on Stalk and Barrel, the province’s oldest micro-distillery, because it’s celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.

I could work from home, but he lost his job and was very bored, so picked up his photography hobby. He already had a lot of equipment at home.

He constantly takes pictures of me: when I’m just waking up, even when I’m asleep.

He snaps me in different sitting or lying down positions when I least expect it. He even tries to pose me when I’m in the midst of doing my work.

I’m glad that he got busy with an interest, but I’m a little uncomfortable as to what he’s done or is planning to do with all those pictures.

I’m often complimented on my figure, so I’m not being conceited when I say that I wonder if some of those wake-up or sleeping shots of me are suggestive.

If I’d been asked and agreed to that kind of photography, it’d be one thing. But he just shot whatever he wanted while I was focused on work.

A: Just ask. What’s pestering your mind is doubt.

You haven’t mentioned whether he was eligible for government assistance during the pandemic. If he’s not, and yet seems to have income, it could be a factor troubling you.

You moved in together during very early dating. Your unasked questions about something so personal show that trust isn’t a firm factor in this still-new relationship during unusual circumstances.

Maybe he just finds you a delightful subject for photography. Or maybe there’s more to it.

But, as partners in a relationship, if you can’t inquire what he’s done, or plans to do, with so many close-up camera portraits of you, then trust IS missing.

My brother (married with two kids) lives with my parents in Europe. He’s abusive to his wife, has a violent relationship with my father.

He won’t move out, won’t get therapy, won’t admit to any wrongdoing. He blames everyone for the failings in his life, especially my parents.

I told him to seek therapy. He shamed me.

His explosions occur frequently. I fear for my mom’s life (she’s 71), how long she can take it. I fear my brother harming himself or someone else. I fear the terrifying hate between him and my father.

How to Help My Brother?

A: Try to help those caught in the middle of this terrifying hatred.

Contact the mental health resources in the country and area where your parents’ home is located.

Explain the volatile danger facing everyone there, including two children.

Ask for confidentiality assurance regarding the authorities not informing the women and kids, who’d be at further risk if suspected of reporting the situation.

Seek whatever help’s available, plus learn the laws regarding when authorities can intervene. Stay in close, private contact with your mother.

If things worsen, try to convince her to find safety elsewhere (quickly and also privately) along with her daughter-in-law and grandchildren.

Inside one neighbourhood cafe’s make or break reopening,'Karon Liu',2020-07-12 00:00:00,"The sight of people eating on patios in the summer sun might look like the dining scene is slowly getting back to normal, but the threat of permanent closure is still on the minds of restaurant owners as they try to figure out how to pay the bills while making a fraction of what they were used to before the COVID-19 shut down.

“Places like mine, which don’t have any backers and are owned by people who live in the neighbourhood they serve, they’re the most at risk,” says Leo Wong, 31, owner of Scenic Coffee + Brunch, a small cafe and brunch spot located in a plaza on Woodbine Ave., just south of Highway 7, in Markham. “We don’t have any financial resources to fall back on.”

Scenic opened in April 2019 and shut down for the first month and a half of the pandemic. This past April, the cafe started taking online orders for baked goods such as Japanese-style cream puffs and mochi brownies. About two weeks ago Wong opened the restaurant for takeout and outdoor dining for three days a week. Since then he’s brought in a total of between $500 and $600, he said. It’s about 10 per cent of what the restaurant made in the same time period in 2019.

That doesn’t cover the money he spent on outdoor furniture so that diners can make reservations to eat in front of the store. “We spent about $300 on six tables and chairs from Ikea. Then this past weekend it was too hot for people to eat in the sun so we spent another $400 on umbrellas. I can’t just build a patio or deck.”

Other costs include $300 to $500 for coffee from a local supplier as well as produce, dairy and other ingredients to last two weeks. The point of sale system costs $70 a month, and he also has an accountant to keep track of payroll and taxes. There’s also service fees with a new reservation system, as well as fees for processing credit and debit cards as many businesses are opting to go cashless to minimize contact with customers. He received a $40,000 small business loan from the government during the pandemic, which he’s been repaying as well. Half of it has already been spent on existing bills.

In addition to himself, there’s usually one other person working at the restaurant, which can usually seat 25. To keep costs down, Scenic is currently only open Friday to Sunday. Wong has three part-time employees making $24 an hour plus tips. Tips have been very little, he added. The hourly wage is more than the usual $16 per hour (about $20 with tips) workers had been making before the pandemic, but Wong said one of his goals upon reopening is paying a more livable wage to essential workers.

He added that he hasn’t paid himself in the last year since the cafe opened, though he splits the tips with staff which works out to $3 to $4 an hour. He moved in with his parents when the restaurant opened last year to save money.

His biggest worry right now is rent. Wong pays $4,000 each month, which also includes utilities and taxes.

“Our space is a sublet and our landlord is a tenant who has been trying to work something out with their landlord but it doesn’t seem like they’re taking the government’s commercial rent subsidy. My landlord hasn’t asked for any money yet, but they might ask for all of it back. Imagine trying to pay four to five months of rent with no revenue.” Wong said he’s worried that if he has to retroactively pay the rent, his business loan would be all used up.

“We thought about raising menu prices but I don’t think it’s the right decision because diners are in a financial struggle themselves,” he said. “There have been talks about doing a coronavirus surcharge, but I don’t think that’s the way to go. It’s the least creative way to go by passing the costs on to people.”

Instead, Wong said there are larger changes that need to happen to help small businesses survive. “There have been problems before the pandemic, but they’re now exacerbated. The hospitality industry is a window into society. A lot of people who work in the industry can’t even afford to live in the city.”

He said in addition to rent forgiveness during the pandemic, the province should revisit the idea of universal basic income. He said that if there’s a universal income, it will allow small business owners to still have some money coming in (for living expenses) while they invest all their money into starting a restaurant, which usually doesn’t make back its money in the first year or two.

“It’s outrageous for it to be a common practice for a restaurant owner to not have an income for the first two to five years. It doesn’t encourage small business owners,” Wong said.

Julie Kwiecinski, Ontario’s director of provincial affairs for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said that even though outdoor dining is now permitted, many smaller restaurants only have room for one or two patio tables. It may cost more to reopen and bring back staff than the revenue they can generate.

A recent survey from the CFIB reported that about 28 per cent of respondents in the hospitality sector across Canada are making a quarter or less of the revenue they made in previous years. Another 20 per cent reported making between a quarter and half of the revenue from before.

“It’s important to recognize that in Ontario, where they are reopening more slowly due to health requirements and higher case loads, the recovery is going to be slower,” she said, noting that even when indoor dining is permitted, it’s not going to be at full capacity, which is what a restaurant needs to turn a profit. “We see programs like the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance, but the question is how long they’re going to be in place.”

In another recent survey by CFIB, members were asked if they’re considering winding down their business or declaring bankruptcy. In Ontario, 16.4 per cent of respondents said yes compared to the national average of 14.3. “Those numbers are for every sector, not just in hospitality, but it’s still a telling number,” Kwiecinski said. “Under normal times, that number is around one per cent.”

While it may seem somewhat back to normal for diners, Wong says restaurants, especially ones like his, are still far from being in the clear.

“I want the average person to understand the difficulties of being a business owner and it’s just not all that glamorous,” Wong said. “I really want to be able to push forward these changes that the coronavirus forced us to look into so that small business owners have the opportunity to survive and contribute to their communities. The current systems in place don’t allow for social and economic stability. Talking about this is the first step.”

Messy, gassy, and unapologetically, I take up space, much like a full-grown Saint Bernard, in my parents’ parallel universe. Sadly, the pandemic has reduced this broke-ass millennial into a drooling state of oversized adolescence. After living in a luxury granite box with six roommates (two of them were front-line workers), and surviving a turtle-slow recovery from COVID-19 symptoms, I found myself moving residences again in May 2020.

At 11 a.m., ravenous, I amble into my parents’ basement for breakfast. I count seven family-sized bags of yam tortilla chips, thirty-two cans of cream of mushroom soup, two forty-pound bags of jasmine rice, and seven bottles of blue dishwashing liquid. Name it, and we most likely have it, buried under the bulk bird seed on Shelf 8.

“Told you to always stock up for emergencies,” my mother announces. I roll my eyes, but I help her set a trap for our ongoing rodent problem.

Diaspora, like heart-exploding grief, OCD, and excessive ambition, has both wrecked and strengthened our family.

My Chinese family belongs to a particular sect of professional hoarders, and this current pandemic has only validated their lifestyle. Like many once impoverished immigrants, we have been preparing — AKA paranoid — for multiple global disasters long before COVID-19 happened. I once used to scoff at this gratuitous habit of radical saving and stockpiling on repeat, but it makes sense to me now.

For as long as I can remember, my parents have resisted the preternatural tug of the homeland. It wasn’t until March 2019 that the siren call, like severe tinnitus, became impossible to ignore. Off to Hong Kong we embarked, a place of once vicious famine and long-squashed dreams. It would be my first time in Asia, and I couldn’t bear to turn down a complimentary trip. Upon leaving Hong Kong International Airport, as if by sorcery, the humidity freshened my sandpaper skin, and volumized my iron-flat Vancouverite hair. It was as if the city was welcoming it’s long lost, weirdo daughter with a makeover.

Our week was a flurry of show and tell and, one day, we went to my parents’ respective villages. We took the MTR from Mong Kok, bussed on public transit, rode a train, which was followed by multiple taxi rides to the slums. It took 4.5 hours to get there. Finally, my mother, almost shyly, showed us her childhood home-school, built on top of a creepy open-hole graveyard, and talked about how she would play with the jutting bones of corpses as a child. The grotesque trees, arthritic-looking and uncared for, made me so sad I felt everything turn to decay inside me.

“No wonder you’re so messed up,” I blurted, and instantly regretted it.

“You’re the one who’s messed up,” she retorted in Cantonese. “Can’t do math, complains all the time about stomach aches-”

“No,” I said, shivering despite the heat. “I mean, this is why you are so scared of ghosts and starving to death.”

“Um, yeah,” she said, smacking me on the back of my head. I groaned.

But then she sighed, eyebrows furrowing together. She glanced around, no longer a simple tourist, as if really looking for the first time, seemingly sorrowful at the dilapidated graves scattered around us. Did she regret coming back? However she felt, for the first time I understood her fear of scarcity, this ancient inherited trauma.

After all, I felt diaspora was best suited for gamblers, entrepreneurs, great white sharks, and hopeless optimists. For the rest of us, mediocres and sentimentalists, when you involuntarily hop country and home, you accumulate a Tantalus gluttony, and you fill the physical void with pragmatic things that can be eaten, bartered or saved. POC, especially impoverished ones like my mother, understand that shit inevitably happens, and it’s best to be prepared. Nice housing is only provisional.

“We’re never coming back,” my mother finally pronounced, and we followed her, like a congregation of fruit flies — far away from her private destitution to our four-star hotel, our temporary home in Asia.

As for me, I didn’t mind Hong Kong at all. In fact, it felt like I had almost never left Vancouver. Everyone looked exactly like me, neither worse nor better. For the remaining trip, we ate and shopped like the middle-class we aspired to be, as if we were badass rice-eaters on vacation instead of scared immigrants on their homecoming. I arrived back in Canada with fifteen cheap polyester dresses, all beaded, lacy and ridiculous, and I decided I was ready for any literary event, Comic-Con or Halloween. It only fazed me a little that being a size 2 in North America meant that I was XXXL in Asia.

In my eccentric, complicated glory, I realized that I’d become capitalism’s bitch and my mother’s daughter: more is better and surplus is safer.

In my parents’ world, though, it often feels like I’m tumbling backwards when my peers are levelling up with adulting in the guise of matrimony, mortgages, babies, promotions. I tell myself when the pandemic is over, surely I’ll move into the RV parked on the driveway or perhaps a distant relation (that I don’t know of) will die, leaving me money and allowing me to purchase a sea vessel. Wouldn’t it be super-fun to live on a houseboat? I think excitedly. You could throw your roommates, friends, lovers, and family members overboard whenever they were too loud or obnoxious.

COVID-19 may be my generation’s diaspora, but it’s also my family’s latest, haunting trauma.

At my parents’ dwelling, I have a recurring high-stress nightmare where I am trying to frantic-pack a wheelie suitcase because the building is supposed to explode in two minutes. Panicked, I hurl clothing into a never ending black hole of fabric. Fed up, I zip up the case, but it expands like an inflatable balloon. Screeching, I beseech the suitcase to rescale to a normal size. Action-heroine I am not, and the suitcase knows this. Eventually, it grows so unwieldy and wide that it doesn’t fit through the door frame, but I’m relentless and determined enough to save all my belongings, even though I know I’m doomed. Then, as the building ignites, special effects inferno-BOOM!, homegirl wakes up-all lock-jawed, sweat-stinky, and terrified. It is a shame to lose all my things! I growl, and regretful I am in this waking life, and so I wonder where I had purchased the defective suitcase. Who do I blame, really, but myself? Anything, at any moment in flight, might turn out to be unbearable, might transform into a sign of absurdity that one might never escape.

Here’s how to ensure your kids stay safe,'Braydon Holmyard',2020-07-10 00:00:00,"Editor’s note: This story is part of a new occasional series and community at the Star called Life with Kids — a place for parents and caregivers with young children to feel heard, informed and connected.

The sign at the local splash pad has new rules: Use your elbow to push the button. Maintain physical distancing. No more than 19 people at a time.

There’s a lot to unpack for parents and caregivers as they try to keep kids cool on hot summer days, with splash pads and public pools now available for use in phase two of Ontario’s reopening plan.

With these outdoor options available for children, another challenge has emerged as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on through the summer: how do you teach kids to play safely?

Signage on splash pads in the city provides guidance on safety measures, such as touching the button with your elbow instead of your hand. But with up to 19 people allowed at some splash pads in popular areas like Toronto’s Centennial Park, ensuring everyone follows those guidelines can be challenging.

We spoke to Dr. Upton Allen, head of infection diseases at Toronto’s SickKids Hospital, to see how parents and caregivers can take advantage of this outdoor public space while keeping themselves and their children safe.

“I try to let them recognize that once the guidelines have been issued for public play areas to open, it usually means that the risk of transmission is likely low. Kids should have fun,” Dr. Allen said, “but there are things that you really should try to do to reduce the risk and let them be aware of that.”

To help get that message across, he came up with a mnemonic called STOP N’ PLAN.

“It won’t be a one-size-fit-all type scenario, but there are some general things parents can talk about that might help them keep their children safe.”

S

Stands for staying away if a child is ill with COVID symptoms. In other words, the old principle of staying home if you’re ill.

T

It relates to touching. Speak to your kids and tell them, ‘don’t touch what is not yours.’ Tell them to focus on their equipment. Don’t be playing with other kids’ equipment or water bottles or supplies.

O

This one is more directed at the parents and stands for observe. Basically what you really want to do is to observe the surroundings, ensure they are safe and clean. Check out the washrooms ahead of time. Is there soap and water to wash your hands? Visit the particular splash pad or playground ahead of time. Know where you’re going before you go there.

P

Is for physical distancing. If you go to a particular area and it is overcrowded on that day, you may want to think, ‘do I really want to go today?’ And if you go somewhere where there’s a lineup, well, at least try and create some physical distance while waiting.

Never, never, never share food or drinks. It might be obvious, but it’s important to teach young kids not to do that.

P

PPE, which is really for the parents based on their local city guidance. If parents are going to be there interacting and standing with other parents, they should have face coverings on.

L

Lave, which means washing and hygiene measures like bringing your own supplies to clean. That’s one thing I always say to the families is to remember to take your wipes, your hand sanitizer, and it’s probably not a bad idea to invest in a Lysol spray to be ready to clean an area that is frequently touched like a table — especially if it’s indoors.

A

Simply avoiding touching your face, eyes and mouth. Kids love to do that, so you can encourage them, but you know they’re still going to do it.

N

Stands for networking among parents at the facilities. If you go somewhere where you know people, that’s always good, but the key is to be able to share information and emphasize the importance that everyone remembers we’re all in this together. Parents need to remember that they could be a source of infection — it’s not just the children.

Dr. Allen said it’s important for kids to be aware of where they are going and why they need to be taking these precautions if they are old enough to understand these conversations. For the younger ones, it can be helpful to focus on short, simple mantras like “hands clean.”

He emphasized that there is a risk in contracting the virus in these settings, much like anywhere else, but it is a low one.

“You want kids to have fun. At the point when the city says you can go out, generally it’s a reflection of advice coming from experts and the risk is low. Given that we’re all in this together, collectively there are things we might be able to do to make that low risk even lower.”

Making something is a great way to escape the stresses of everyday life, helping to distract you — even if just for a few minutes — from the reality of living in the midst of a pandemic.

Crafts like knitting keep our hands and minds busy and can be therapeutic, says Amelia Lyon, who owns Yarns Untangled, a knitting shop in Kensington Market.

It’s not uncommon for customers to come into the shop looking for ways to relax and de-stress, says Lyon, who has had customers stop in because a therapist or friend prescribed it. “It can help relax you, the repetitive action of your hands, the same one or two stitches over and over. Some days I get wound up and I realize it’s because I haven’t knit in a little while. I pick up my needles and calm right down.”

From knitting to folding origami or updating old furniture with paint, here are some crafts to help you pass the time and feel a little more relaxed — using stuff you probably have at home or can easily get at a local shop with curbside pickup.

Keep little hands occupied with origami

All you need is paper and a little patience to make simple origami creations. There are countless shapes to fold paper into; the paper crane may be the most well-known design of the age-old Japanese art. It’s a great craft to keep kids entertained and, as an added bonus, it requires minimal materials and makes very little mess.

Any type of paper can be cut into a square and used to fold origami, says Jocelyn Tamura, a student at the University of Toronto and member of UTFold, an origami club whose community projects include an origami program at the Hospital for Sick Children. Origami is a way for patients to relax, says Tamura, who hosts workshops that patients and their families can attend before or after appointments.

“It requires focus and distracts from any other thoughts or worries related to their hospital visit; it’s similar in some ways to meditation,” says Tamura. “Instead of focusing on the breath, we focus on the folds of the paper. It’s surprised me how much it can help young children, who may start off in a bad mood and leave far happier and calmer.”

If you don’t have origami paper on hand, it’s easy to make your own squares. A typical A4 size sheet of paper works perfectly. Help younger children get started by cutting paper into squares and try models beforehand to make sure the difficulty level is appropriate. Tamura recommends choosing simple models like animals and paper airplanes to start.

There are lots of how-to videos online but, for inspiration, look to Oriland, an online paper fantasyland of origami creations run by internationally recognized artists Katrin and Yuri Shumakov from Toronto. Learn origami, find 70-plus free design diagrams and instructions on basic folds. The couple have written over 30 books about origami and created more than 800 unique designs. Find supplies at the Paper Place.

Jump on the dried flower trend

It’s no secret that flowers are a great pick-me-up, but fresh flowers don’t last forever, which could be one of the reasons dried flowers are making a comeback.

“Dried flower arrangements now make up about one-third of our business” says Shannon Whelan, a floral designer and owner of Euclid Farms in Toronto. “The idea of buying something that you can enjoy, and will also dry and last, definitely makes sense,” says Whelan. “If a bouquet doesn’t sell I can hang them upside down and dry them.”

It’s easy to do yourself. All you need are fresh flowers and string. After you’ve enjoyed the flowers, tie string around the stems and hang them upside down so they are spaced apart. Keep them out of direct sunlight and humidity, and leave them to dry until the base of the flower head is strong and brittle, about two to four weeks.

A good rule of thumb is to choose blooms with a woody stem and avoid flowers that hold a lot of water, like tulips, which have thick, watery stems that won’t dry well and end up mouldy, says Whelan. Opt for heartier stems like roses, hydrangea varieties like Annabelle, or eucalyptus.

Get creative arranging dried blooms in vases, jars or other containers that you have around the house. A quick search online will yield project ideas and video tutorials, from making a wreath to something as simple as filling a cloche with leftover dried flower heads. “People are buying gold hoops to use as wreath frames and only decorating one small portion of it, and it becomes this really interesting hanging element,” says Whelan.

Learn how to knit

Anyone can learn to knit, says Lyon of Yarns Untangled, which offers small-run, hand-dyed yarn suited to Toronto’s knitting and crochet community. “I have yet to find somebody that I can’t teach to knit, if they want to learn. It just takes the right combination of tools and the right teacher, video or instruction,” says Lyon, who learned to knit as a child.

Beginners should learn the basics by focusing on smaller projects like a mug cosy or coaster, before moving on to bigger projects like a sweater or blanket, says Lyon. “A lot of people start with a scarf, but these days we’ve been gently steering people away from that, because they take a really long time. The beginning of your project is going to look like you were learning, but by the end it will look smooth.”

Stick to an acrylic blend yarn when starting out; it’s inexpensive and a basic approachable material, says Lyon. She also steers beginners away from traditional straight needles to circular needles, which are more versatile and just as easy to use.

While the shop’s classes have been cancelled and weekly stitch nights have moved online due to COVID-19, Lyon recommends online for how-to videos or books. “Once you know the basic stitch, you can make a scarf, a hat, all kinds of different things.”

Use paint to transform old furniture

Spring is a good time to get outside and start a paint project. Whether it’s an old chair or table in need of sprucing up, or painting terracotta pots — perfect for the kids — painting can be a relaxing and satisfying DIY.

“It’s wonderfully soothing to pick up a paintbrush,” says Annie Sloan, an artist and inventor of Chalk Paint by Annie Sloan. Her first flagship shop opened its doors in Toronto last spring.

“Finding a creative outlet can make a huge difference to one’s well-being during these worrying times. If you are able to get your hands on a tin, then now’s the time to start painting those walls or transforming a piece of furniture,” says Sloan.

If you’ve got a little leftover paint from a past project, try adding a stripe or two to jugs and vases, or stencil trays and tables: the simplest splashes of colour and pattern can breathe fresh life into your home and can also be a great way to keep children occupied.

Get creative with some fruit and vegetable printing. “It’s not just for potatoes,” says Sloan. “Try using some lemons, limes, peppers, okra or whatever you have available in the kitchen, to add some fun prints to napkins or an old tablecloth.”

“In that moment, when I knew I needed to mend myself, I was looking around for something to do, and sashiko came back to me,” says Theriault who had taken a sashiko workshop a couple of years before. “I was mending myself, my garments and I started to think, what else could I mend in my life?” says Theriault, a life-long sewer who teaches mindful mending and sashiko workshops in Guelph, Ontario, and sells sashiko supplies at her online shop Cedars + Sage.

Even if you’ve never heard of sashiko, which translates as “little stabs,” you may be familiar with the look which includes bold geometric patterns hand-stitched with white thread onto indigo dyed fabric. It’s a type of mending that is meant to be seen.

The technique originated in rural, northern Japan about 400 years ago to mend and patch clothes, extending the life and increasing the warmth of worn garments with added layers of cloth.

Today, visible mending is also an antidote to fast fashion – enabling crafters to mend rips, tears and general wear of clothing and other textiles, and it’s having a revival.

“We are becoming more conscious of our impact on the earth. This is a way to lesson our impact, to not throw away things, to keep them and avoid buying more,” says Theriault. “I also feel that anything that is working with our hands is having a bit of a revival right now.”

Toronto maker Stacey Sproule has seen a surge of interest in the craft since she started teaching visible mending classes in 2015. Classes would get cancelled, rarely selling out, but in the last year or so, she says every class has sold out.

“My workshops are aimed at getting you ready to feel empowered to start fixing your clothes. But I think that to say that you have to do this because it’s pragmatic is not enough, it’s visually satisfying too – it’s good for the planet and also beautiful – it’s a win-win,” says Sproule.

The craft appeals to everyone from sewers to people who haven’t worked with a needle and thread at all and makers such as Sproule say that the craft appeals to all ages – from younger people in their mid-twenties to the elderly.

Locally, the craft is taking off with shops such as The Make Den on Sterling Rd. and The Workroom on Queen St. offering workshops and classes.

Mending forces us to slow down.

Judith Martin is a Canadian textile artist from Manitoulin Island who uses naturally dyed thread and cloth to create hand stitched quilts. “Stitching the quilts makes me feel good,” says Martin. “I do this repetitive motion with my hands and run my hands over this beautiful texture that I’ve made, I feel better, I slow down and I think about things that come into my head and solve problems.”

Craft enthusiast Julie Cathro-Silver, took a sashiko workshop after noticing it had become trendy. She’s still working on mending the jeans she started and during this period of social distancing has started working on them again. “I’ve always found creativity to be therapeutic, with Sashiko mending, it’s the same thing — sitting with a project, even when my skills aren’t great, feels good, peaceful, and calming … the tactile nature of sewing is something that is very therapeutic to me, especially when the world is in full blown chaos.”

Although there are rules around sashiko, such as: the size of stitch (¼ inch, which works out to be the same size as a short grain of rice), the size of the spaces in between, stitches must be done in an order — all the horizontal lines and then all the vertical lines no matter how intricate your pattern. There is a lot of mindful thought in how you prepare to stitch but “the stitch itself – a running stitch, is the most basic stitch you can do,” says Sproule. “I’ve never had anyone throw up their arms and say I can’t do this.”

Basically, all you need is a needle and thread to get started. The idea is that you’re gathering several stitches of material onto a needle and then pulling it through, rather than going up and down, so a long needle is helpful. “But you can still do it with any needle,” says Sproule. “It’s just going to feel a little bit different.” If you can’t get hold of sashiko needles, long darner needles also work, and although 100 per cent cotton Japanese floss works best, in a pinch, you could use embroidery floss. When tackling a mending project, she recommends starting with woven materials such as cotton, linen or denim.

“I like to talk about it as feeling empowered to repair the things that you love. Nothing is hopeless. It’s a meditation on hope in some ways,” says Sproule.

Arts and crafts are often a go-to activity for parents and whether that includes a box of crayons and a sheet of paper or something more complex, the experience of taking a moment to create something can also offer a little bit of comfort in these uncertain times.

“Making space for creativity is transformative,” says Heather Phillips, owner of Articulations an art store in Toronto’s Junction neighbourhood. “We’ve always been big believers in daily creativity. Just taking the time to be present in the moment and create something is important for your well-being.” Phillips says she could sense the collective uncertainty in the community and a lot of idle hands, so she decided to do something to help parents. In just a few days, the store created, packaged and distributed 120 Stay Home Art Kits to give to families for free or by donation.

“We couldn’t offer any programs because we all have to stay home so we thought it would be nice to just share the items that we have. Whatever we had in the studio, we packaged them up into bite-sized pieces that parents could share with their kids,” says Phillips, who advertised the project on social media. “The response was insane, as soon as I posted the information online, the appointment slots quickly sold out.”

The kits were made up of a combination of used and new materials that the shop had accumulated from running children’s art programming over the past eight years, and included materials to create crafts such as hand puppets, paper weaving, acrylic painting and card making kits.

Phillips says that there are lots of crafts that you can do with materials around the house, including the recycling bin – such as painting cardboard boxes, using Styrofoam containers to make stamps or creating a family time capsule as a snapshot of this unique time together.

Here are 7 crafty activities that will help keep little hands busy and can be ordered online from local shops or downloaded for free.

Toronto artist Lindsay Stephenson created a series of free colouring sheets that can be downloaded from her shop The Penny Paper Co.

Stephenson says she finds the act of colouring meditative not only for her but also her 9-year old son Oscar. “It’s amazing how quiet the room goes as everyone focuses on their own sheets.”

Go ahead, let the kids draw on the walls with a giant colouring poster that can be hung on a wall or placed on the floor. Kids can colour and doodle to their hearts content. Order online from the Roncesvalles neighbourhood shop Early Bird & Worm - have it shipped or if you live locally, take advantage of the free porch drop-off. Giant Colouring Poster, $22.

Cross Stitching is a great hands-on craft for kids. With only one basic stitch to master, it’s a great introduction to embroidery. Stitching helps them to hone fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination and because it uses a blunt-end embroidery needle, it’s not as sharp as a sewing needle. The colourful over-the-rainbow cross stitch kit from Diana Watters Handmade is a fun starter project that includes everything they need to get started making a rainbow keychain or backpacker charm. Over the Rainbow Cross Stitch Kit, $22.

Ocneanu says that after sending a few kits to quarantined family members living in Italy, they realized how important it was to have something to fill their time. “That made me realize that our work is more meaningful now, in these times of social distancing, yet not everyone is aware of us or able to purchase our products.” So, they created a line of small print-at-home “Stay Safe, Craft Away” kits, and although the projects are generally meant for adults or older kids - the free, printable kits allow for a lot of trial and error and keep little, crafty hands busy and out of trouble.

His youngest (mid-20s, employed full-time) was living with us when the pandemic hit.

He’s the only stepchild of mine who’s never warmed up to me. He’s dismissive of me (and his father) and can be overtly rude.

He chose to self-quarantine with his relatively new boyfriend, who then moved in with us, too! He’s made little effort to get to know us.

Both were temporarily laid off and living nocturnally with noisy midnight feasts.

Despite receiving government financial assistance, my husband bought their groceries and alcohol (they’ve never offered to help out and they only clean up after themselves from eating).

Their interpretation of social distancing is far looser than ours. Our other children have been very cautious and only do curbside visits.

Both my husband and I are caring for aging parents (all mid-90s!) in their own homes. We’re terrified about exposing them to COVID-19.

Each time my stepson pushes for “more” relaxation of the lockdown (parties in the yard, haircuts, etc.), we’ve asked him to wait and explained why.

He then becomes rude, threatening and disrespectful to my husband.

I feel that if he wants to live like an adult making his own choices he should move out into his own place, which he can afford.

It’s causing great stress in our marriage and I don’t know how much more I can take. It’s also beginning to affect my physical and mental health. I feel unsafe in my own home, always wiping down everything, yet have no say.

Is it wrong to feel that we, as the true adults in the home, have a right to only move into Phase 2 at our comfort level?

What rights do these young adults have, making decisions that could be risky for others who are more vulnerable in our bubble?

They’ve been able to get out for walks and runs, have backyard visits to their other sets of parents, go for drives …

We’re just pleading with them to stay home as much as possible.

I know that I’ll have to re-emerge into this new world but feel that, given resurgences in the states that have opened too quickly, I’d rather wait this out a little bit longer.

I believe that my husband and I should have the right to make that decision in our own home.

Who Should Rule Our Home?

A: These are not kids, but they’re acting like spoiled teenagers avoiding any responsibilities.

They’re old enough to care for, and can afford, a home that they can rent together.

Your stepson’s been rude and thoughtless, taken advantage of his father and your joint hospitality to both him and a boyfriend you two hardly knew.

They’ve demonstrated no gratitude, offered no help and argued against your efforts to protect your elderly parents.

Whatever kept your stepson distant from you in the past, you’ve accommodated him long enough during the unusual demands of a pandemic.

His father also needs to tell his son, kindly but firmly, that it’s clear that he is ready for a great deal more say in how he lives.

And the natural and logical way for that to happen is by moving to his own home.

He’s from Eastern Europe, a completely different culture from mine. He’s so passionate about everything he does and about whatever other people do.

He’s sometimes an angry man who’ll say anything in front of anyone, without caring about the consequences.

What triggers his anger could be a small thing that he’ll yell and complain about.

But if I oppose his angry behaviour (e.g. by asking, “How can you talk like this …?”) he’ll turn to verbal abuse.

If I keep arguing, he could proceed to physical abuse.

However, when things are good, he’s caring, loving and understanding.

But as soon as he gets angry (even at his own boss sometimes), he becomes a volcano of dissatisfaction, saying negative things about me, my family, people in general, the world.

He doesn’t care about what other people may think about him.

Also, when he gets angry and behaves insanely, he later apologizes, saying that he shouldn’t have done it, that he cannot control his anger.

Then I try to sit down with him and extract the reason. He’ll talk about how his mother was depressed when he was a child, ignoring him and not caring about him. She once put a knife on his neck.

He’ll say how the Balkan War affected him …

What confuses me more is that he’s very supportive of my work and success.

I don’t know if the problem is in me because, when he gets angry, I can’t handle his loud, scary voice so I argue back in that moment of anger, which escalates things more.

Is He a Narcissist?

A: His eruptive, angry and dangerous behaviour is the problem here, not your uncertainty as to which label it falls under.

More important, don’t ever again question whether the problem is, as you wrote, “in me.” No, it’s deeply in him, sometimes rising harshly against you as physical abuse.

Reader: “For anyone contemplating marrying someone or living common-law: if your partner owns a house or cottage and you intend to put money into it, see a lawyer first to have the title changed to either joint tenancy or tenants in common.

She plans to travel exotic parts of the world with her baby just a few months after it’s born.

My daughter is a sweet, loving person but not very practical. She’s a steady, responsible worker and has some savings, but she can only rely for extras on her maternity-leave income. We’re not rich parents.

But she already told me that she’d be expecting hands-on help from me and her father, with no realization that his serious health problems will limit his helping with a newborn.

She also wants us to travel to meet her and the infant in the different countries she plans to visit.

The pregnancy is still very early. I told her to have an abortion. She’s already done so with past pregnancies so she said she’ll have to think about it.

But there’s a limit on how long she can take, if she’s to have a legal abortion.

She’s seeing a doctor soon. What should I do to get her to give up this pregnancy? Would you tell her to get an abortion?

Very Worried Mother

A: The decision to have or not have an abortion is not one I’d ever advise on from this column, which deals with relationships, not the religious factors nor medical issues nor human values that may be involved in that decision.

But there are other issues involved regarding your daughter’s life, which you as her mother can/should discuss with her.

One is her lack of personal responsibility regarding sex. At 29, and having already had unwanted pregnancies, she’s apparently not bothered to prevent them.

She also seems to envision an infant as a doll that she can easily transport in a backpack along with her other portable belongings.

If your daughter is as offhand, casual, impetuous and free-spirited as she sounds, she needs a lot of input from you about getting informed on infant care, necessary precautions regarding tropical diseases, travel restrictions due to the pandemic if it hasn’t disappeared, etc.

While I won’t tell her to have an abortion, I will tell her this: It takes a lot more than pregnancy to be a mother.

She needs to start acting like one now — by discussing her plans with her doctor, taking prenatal courses, talking to a tropical disease specialist about the advisability of taking an infant on such a trip, etc., etc.

Q: On a vacation last year, my husband was always eager to go to the lobby to access free Wi-Fi there.

I once caught him texting a friend’s girlfriend about what she was wearing. Confronted, he said she was talking about what she planned to wear to a wedding. He was short with me.

We’ve been married for 30 years with three kids and five grandkids.

I’ve caught him in a couple of lies. When confronted, he’d change his stories. He’ll go on and on … still lying, but being abrupt with me.

Then she realized how diet culture was affecting her kids,'Jen Kirsch',2020-01-09 00:00:00,"This story is part of a week-long series on dieting in 2020. Next up: Dieting and social media.

With a new year comes new trends. But when it comes to diet culture, a quick scan of the glossy magazines at grocery store checkouts shows how much we prize the dramatic weight loss story.

But just what effect does all this diet talk have on children?

Sarah Landry — known as @thebirdspapaya to her over 814K Instagram followers — has been vocal in her efforts to change how we talk about and display the diversity of the human body.

Landry, who lives outside of Toronto, went through a transformation several years ago, losing roughly 110 pounds in the span of a few years, ultimately dropping to an unhealthy weight for her — 114 pounds — and a size zero.

It wasn’t until she reached her “goal weight,” that she realized she wasn’t happy, nor was she healthy.

People were still congratulating her, even after she lost even more weight because of stress and life circumstances.

“I began to realize how many red flags there were toward diet culture and disordered eating,” says Landry. “It was unhealthy ... It was almost impossible to maintain (my weight) with how little I could eat and how much I had to exercise to stay that weight.”

She was obsessively calorie counting, weighing herself multiple times a day, and exercising out of guilt and fear around food and weight gain.

The mother of three wanted to set a better example for her children, especially her two daughters, Jemma, 11 and Maya, 13.

“It bothered me when my daughter, Jemma, was speaking about me and said to me something like ‘People love you for your weight loss,” said Landry.

And yet, her transformation story and her powerful posts on Instagram about accepting her body, landed her dedicated followers, magazine covers and media attention.

As she struggled with where the weight loss ended and she began, she worried what affect this behaviour was having on her kids.

“I can’t control TV and how inclusive it is but I can control the words that come out of my mouth and the conversations we have at home, and it starts with how I talk about myself and what I’m proud of,” Landry said.

After Jemma commented about the praise her mom receives, Landry made immediate changes, starting in their home. “There’s no diet culture talk allowed at home. We’ve gotten rid of scales in the house. I don’t want there to be this defining moment for them that they have a number. I want to continue to have a redirection of conversation and a change in the ways we talk about our bodies and ourselves,” said Landry.

Kyla Fox, clinical therapist and an eating disorder specialist, tells the Star that kids are sponges to their surroundings and are acutely attuned to their caregivers and their environment.

“The ways you feel about food and your body will be a mirror for your children. More of the work is on caregivers to heal themselves and their ideologies around food and their body in order to influence a positive relationship for their children,” says Fox. “If you don’t believe in the messages you’re hoping to instill like, ‘everything in moderation,’ ‘beauty from the inside out,’ ‘love the skin you’re in,’ neither will your kids.

Fox who has two young daughters, struggled with an eating disorder when she was younger and noticed care gaps and fundamental flaws in the treatment and recovery approach, which is why she developed The Kyla Fox Centre, a clinical and holistic eating disorder centre in Toronto.

The language we use within the house around food affects kids from a young age so it’s important to be mindful about talking about healthy dietary habits, she said.

But how can parents change the conversation to have a positive effect on their kids?

“To feel healthy is to learn how to live healthier. Perhaps the conversation is more about that. Mom wants to live her best life, feel stronger, happier, safer, share feelings more easily, take up more space in the world, go after what matters, listen in to her body more, understand what makes her feel full,” said Fox. “If we lived in a world where there was more open and honest communication about how to really feel healthy, we would be tapping in way deeper to ourselves and to each other.”

While parents can monitor language at home, they can’t control external forces that play on a child’s insecurities. This includes comments by other children or things they see on social media. Fox says a parent should be attentive to a child’s behaviour and address issues as soon as they are noticed. Is your tween reading calories on labels and selecting the item with a few less? If so, this is an opportunity to educate, have a deeper conversation to discover the root of why they’re behaving this way.

“The relationship your child develops with their body is an articulation of the way your child feels about themselves. And so being emotionally filled up — emotionally communicative, emotionally able to process, emotionally validated, emotionally supported — means that a child will be less likely to take out their feelings on their body through food. People who love themselves don’t hurt themselves,” said Fox.

“The only way to actively support others is to not hide behind your concerns, but address them. ‘Hey, I noticed you’re doing these things now that you didn’t do before, are you OK? Why do you think you have started this? Know that I’m here for you and want to be able to talk honestly.’ Opening up space for a bigger, safer conversation is key to bringing someone’s suffering/rituals/preoccupations forward,” said Fox.

Jemma now has an Instagram account of her own, bearing witness to her mom’s positive messaging, affirmations and body empowerment.

“As parents we can get so caught up being distracted by our bodies that we forget how many amazing things are going on around us,” Landry said.

Instead of asking your partner or friends whether an outfit makes you look fat, or asking how many calories are in something, or constantly complaining about having to lose 10 more pounds — all which create a negative dialogue for children — share what you love about yourself, she said.

Landry suggests “being mindful about how we speak about ourselves, and reminding each other to not comment on others bodies, when it comes up.”

Most importantly, don’t speak poorly about yourself, she said.

It’s not easy to learn to do but “When you take that out of the picture, you can connect more fully. More completely,” said Landry.

“I’m proud I got to change my own tune and have (my kids) be witness to it,” she said.",[],1131,0.8704955069223661

Next up: Why you shouldn’t diet.

What’s the first thing everyone does when they set out to lose weight? Join the gym.

That might be an important symbolic gesture. And it’s certainly good for other reasons. But it’s probably not going to help you lose a lot of weight, despite what most of us think. That message is starting to get out there, thanks, in part, to internet advice suggesting we put less stock in exercise to lose weight. Or, as the clickbait headlines put it, “Stop exercising to lose weight.”

The headlines might be misleading (we’ll get to that), but they are getting more people to face a certain reality: We burn way fewer calories than we think we do, even with a rigorous workout.

“It breaks down to the fact that it’s really hard to exercise enough to make a really big caloric deficit,” says Dr. Jennifer Kuk, associate professor at York University’s Faculty of Health. “When you look at shows like The Biggest Loser, people have to quit their jobs and exercise all day to get into the thousand calories of energy expenditure range, which is what you need for fast and dramatic weight loss.”

And, despite the fact that many of us have fitness apps on our phones and wrists, few of us are really thinking about what our calorie expenditures really mean—when translated into food. We have a tendency to over-estimate what we burn and underestimate what we consume and, as a result, some people over-compensate for lost energy by indulging in an over-the-top post-workout binge that’s three or four more times what they just lost. Stories of marathon runners who gained weight while training (often from sugary beverages) surface pretty regularly, demonstrating that even so-called “extreme athleticism” doesn’t give people a carte blanche to eat anything they want.

“We are so much better at eating back the calories than we are at exercising,” says Dr. Kuk, “I used to work in fitness clubs that had those organic healthy stores with the shakes and the cookies and I would see people on the treadmill, then see what they consumed afterwards. I guarantee you they more than doubled the number of calories they burnt.”

That doesn’t mean we should give up or cut back on exercising, though. Dr. Kuk, whose research is on obesity, diet and physical activity, says benefits transcend weight loss, and is alarmed that some people might be getting the wrong idea from online headlines.

“I know where that advice comes from,” she explains, “Basically there have been studies that have looked at different doses of exercise and divided people into three groups, thinking that the groups that did the most exercise would lose more weight. Instead, there was a tapered effect and the people doing the most exercise lost less than what you might expect. They actually did a little bit worse than the group below them.”

Dr. Kuk says that study started a debate about exercise and its relationship to weight loss, noting that it’s still unclear whether or not surpassing the “threshold of vigorous exercise,” really makes us eat more. Another interpretation, for example, could be that, having really gone to town at the gym, people are more likely to give themselves the rest of the day off—and fail to burn the calories they normally would. Either way, some clinical studies working on reversing Type-2 diabetes have actually discouraged subjects from increasing exercise while trying to lose weight.

Of course, this all assumes you’re exercising to lose weight. There are a lot of other reasons to hit the gym, advises Dr. Jason Fung, a well-known Toronto diet doctor and author of the forthcoming The Obesity Code Cookbook.

“I always say it’s like brushing your teeth,” says Dr. Fung. “It’s good to do it everyday so you’ll have better breath and fewer cavities, but don’t expect it to help you lose weight. It’s the same with exercise. You’re going to get benefits, but weight loss is something that’s really very inefficiently done by focusing on the exercise.”

Dr. Fung says we should think of diet and exercise as two separate things, with exercise playing a very small supporting role in weight loss. Instead, we should focus our energies on eating less and eating better food. “Willpower is sort of a finite resource,” he says, “So if you’re spending all your willpower on getting up and running, even when you don’t want to, you’re going to have less strength to avoid the foods that are testing you, like the donuts that are sitting in front of you at the Tim Hortons.”

So maybe keep on exercising, just maybe stop exercising to lose weight. Instead, he suggests we exercise to improve flexibility and/or become stronger. That’s something Dr. Kuk would agree with, given her research has shown that, even if people fail to lose a single pound, health risks associated with obesity can be mitigated with regular physical activity.

“Exercising for 30 minutes every day, even going for a walk after lunch, has been associated with beneficial effects for blood pressure, mental health and energy levels,” she says. “I mean, there are so many positive health effects from physical activity just, unfortunately, it isn’t as good at helping you lose weight as most people think.”

So go ahead and join the gym. Just don’t count on it as the key to shed pounds. And maybe try to find a fitness club that doesn’t have a handy little shake shack to tempt you into gaining back all those calories before you even walk out the door.",[],954,0.9497415019443792

Diets are so last year.

That’s the message a lot of registered dietitians are hoping to get out there, in hopes of convincing people not to embark on a new diet — any new diet — as a New Year’s resolution. Why not? Because nutrition experts are trying to encourage people to give “lifestyle management” a shot instead.

“The idea of following a diet is something we’ve been walking away from for a very long time,” explains Joanne Lewis, director of healthcare provider education and engagement at Diabetes Canada. “In fact, we try very hard not to use the word ‘diet’ anymore, because changing behaviour is not something that comes easily to people in general, since humans adopt their eating habits over time. It’s not something we can just flip a switch and easily change.”

That’s one reason most diets tend to fail the vast majority of people. One registered dietitian recently told me the average time people stick to a diet is about 30 days — and three months is a real success story. It might be thrilling to radically change-up your diet and feel like you’re really making a difference — at first. However, big changes don’t tend to survive the first high-stress period at work, or the first family vacation.

Worse, perhaps, is the fact that diets are a one-size-fits-all solution, as opposed to a plan for change based on an individual’s tastes, needs and limitations (be they time or money). At its best, lifestyle management begins with a solid assessment of your actual lived life to see what can be changed and what cannot. When done in a clinical setting to help a person dealing with, say, an obesity-related illness, it’s called a “lifestyle intervention,” meaning the patient has outside help, like a coach or nutritionist. Lewis says it’s not impossible to do on our own, although she strongly suggests people enlist friends or family to support lifestyle changes.

“To start off, before you change anything, just write down everything that you consume every day for a few days, making sure to include a weekend in there,” she advises. “People are much more successful when they start keeping a food diary and really look at it. The reality is most people know what they should be doing but don’t know where to start. They can start to see where they can make changes when it’s all laid out in front of them.”

From there, a lifestyle coach would suggest starting with one small change that can be made relatively easily. Lewis uses the example of starting to eat breakfast, if, say, you’re the sort of person who skips it, then becomes so hungry later that you overeat. Once eating breakfast is old hat, it’s time to introduce a new habit, like, for instance, taking a walk after lunch. Once you’ve mastered that, cut out that afternoon frappuccino and drink hot tea instead. The key here is to think about what needs to be done, then wade in slowly, getting used to the temperature.

That’s not nearly as sexy as plunging right into, say, the grapefruit diet, which dangles the promise of nine pounds lost over seven short days. We seem to fall for these diets time and again, mainly because we’re not satisfied with gradual weight loss.

“I think you don’t notice gaining two or three or four pounds in one year, but then, you know, cumulatively, after say five years, you start to notice it,” says Lewis. “And then one day it hits you. Nothing fits and then you want to go back to where you were five years ago right away, not realizing that it took you five years to put the weight on in the first place.”

In a 2006 book, Mindless Eating, Dr. Brian Wansink suggested we’d all be better off if we could get used to the idea of taking weight off slowly (the way we put it on in the first place) instead of being determined to take it all off at once. He says gradual weight loss is much easier, since our bodies fight against low-calorie deprivation diets by going into “conservation mode” — making it harder to burn fat. Add to that Wansink thinks there’s a limit to the amount of self-denial we can handle, especially in an environment where our willpower is constantly tested by an abundance of readily available snacks and a constant barrage of food porn. And he was writing before everyone Instagrammed their breakfasts.

For Wansink, the key is to skip the deprivation and, instead, focus on cutting out the mindless eating — finishing off the last slice of pizza just because it’s there, grabbing a donut to break up the day, or grazing on post-dinner snacks while binge-watching a TV series. That’s how we put the weight on — 100 or 200 calories per day that we never even realized we were eating — so, Wansink reasons that’s also the best way to take it off.

That fits in perfectly with lifestyle management — a diet you don’t even know you’re on. It starts with paying attention, then becomes a lifestyle when you reform most of the bad, mindless habits, and swap in good ones instead. This includes not just diet, but also physical activity, which could be something as small as getting up from your desk every once in a while. And not for a snack.

Best of all, unlike the grapefruit diet, it’s sustainable. And the new mantra in nutritional advice is quickly becoming: “If you can’t do it for the rest of your life, don’t do it at all.”

Read the rest of the series at thestar.com/life.

After a lifetime of dieting and problems with binge-eating, Bobby Umar is down 35 pounds.

The weight loss began in June, when the 48-year-old motivational speaker decided to finally give the keto diet a 30-day trial run. Umar had resisted that low-carb, high-fat diet for years, since he didn’t think he’d ever be willing to give up pasta, rice and bread permanently. A 30-day challenge, though, seemed like a reasonable amount of time to try something new, so he gave it a shot.

“The first two weeks were really hard but, once I got past that, things really took off,” recalls Umar. “If you can get to that point, that’s when the hunger goes down significantly. I would say my appetite dropped by about 70 per cent and that’s when the weight really started coming down.”

More important, he says, was his change in mindset. After radically reducing both carbs and sugar, he found himself re-defining his idea of a “treat.” Instead of rewarding himself with an occasional dessert or sweet, Umar started thinking of a piece of good bread as an indulgence. Best of all, the binge-eating just stopped, something he attributed to both the keto and the fact that he started skipping breakfast.

“Breakfast is where all the sugar comes from like the bread and jam and things like that that I love, so avoiding breakfast works really well for me,” he says. “And I was worried that I’d eat too much at lunch, which is one of my triggers but, after two weeks, I wasn’t even binging at lunch for the first time in my life.”

As someone deeply immersed in diet culture, though, Umar was keenly aware that a lot of people who lose weight on deprivation diets can’t maintain the regimen and wind up putting the weight back on a year or two later. So Umar figured out ways to make it more sustainable for his lifestyle and preferences by tweaking it and combining it with other diets, including intermittent fasting, which touts the virtues of skipping or postponing breakfast. He says he sometimes gets comments from people who complain he’s not authentically keto, thanks to his modifications to the diet, which include less fat, more vegetables, and a stubborn refusal to give up popcorn.

He’s not alone. A lot of people try to get the best out of super-diets like keto, vegan and intermittent fasting by cherry-picking the things they like. There’s even one that’s trending these days, the “pegan” diet, a paleo/vegan hybrid that encourages people to cut out all sugar, legumes, alcohol and grains and, instead, eat mainly plants. One version of the pegan diet does allow for a tiny bit of meat (think along the lines of bacon on a salad), but it’s pretty restrictive.

“It kind of sounds like two worlds colliding,” explains Lianne Phillipson, a Toronto area registered nutritionist, consultant and author. “Because those on the paleo diet are really eating a lot of fish and meat, and then add in veganism to it, which restricts people to just plants. Combining the two seems really restrictive and I’m not really sure how anyone would be able to follow it for any period of time.”

Unlike peganism, most people’s Franken-diet plans aim to be less restrictive, not more, says Phillipson, who says it’s really common to see people modifying low-carbohydrate diets, in part, because it’s hard to stay on them for a long time, but there are some aspects of them that are good for our bodies and help us lose weight. “Those diets work for a lot of people because you get rid of a lot of the grains, like that morning sugary muffin or croissant or donut or whatever,” she says. “That’s really quite a good boundary to put up.”

Instead, fill that hole with a little inspiration from the vegan diet—fresh fruit and nuts, refried black beans with guacamole or, perhaps, a breakfast salad—which all help on the overall nutrition front, since Phillipson says almost everyone she’s ever worked with needs more fruits and vegetables. Although Phillipson thinks the pegan diet doesn’t offer enough variety to be sustainable for most people, a good vegan diet is nutrient-rich and low-fat—so long as you’re steering clear of processed faux-meat.

Although there’s a lot of variation when it comes to the philosophy, the elements that seem to work in a lot of diets, be they vegan, keto or (as Phillipson points out) Mediterranean, are remarkably similar, namely, avoiding processed food and excessive sugar and trying to eat as much “real food” as possible, especially fruits and vegetables.

All of that fits in perfectly with intermittent fasting, too, since these foods make it easier to feel full for a longer time than refined carbs and ultra-processed foods. Dr. Jason Fung, the Toronto doctor who wrote the book (several books actually) on fasting, calls fasting a “powerful addition to any diet,” since, he says, no matter how good the diet is, if you’re snacking all the time, it’s not going to work.

Bobby Umar would surely agree. “All my life, I never felt in control of myself and for the first time, I actually felt in control,” he says. “I was resigned to the idea that maybe I was going to have binge-eating as part of my life but I never binged once.”

He adds: “It’s hard to explain but, as someone who struggled with weight for 35 years, having control is extremely empowering.”",[],941,0.9174057437631922

Next up: Keto, vegan, fasting —how to get the most out of the super-diets.

Whether you’re dieting to improve your health or physical appearance, it’s hard to go it alone. While people used to seek out friends to hold them accountable and struggle alongside them, it’s becoming more and more common to find support online.

No matter what the niche, from fasting to keto and paleo, it’s easy to find a group of health-enthusiasts who are following the same regime you are, but can this lead to dangerous misinformation?

“When we’re talking about these kinds of forums or support groups, we really position them in the social aspect that it may affect how someone starts to view their body, their thoughts, feelings and behaviours around food and weight. If that starts to get really negative, it can lead to behaviours that can cause disordered eating,” says Ary Maharaj from the The National Eating Disorder Information Centre.

Weight loss can be a slippery slope, especially when it comes to more extreme diets like intermittent fasting, a trendy diet followed by celebrities including Kourtney Kardashian and Hugh Jackman, it consists of scheduling your meal times within a certain window. The most common form is 16:8, which means you fast for 16 hours and have an 8 hour eating window (ie. 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).

And within the fasting umbrella is the snake diet, a more controversial regime that requires zero food consumption, just electrolyte-filled supplements. Founded by trainer Cole Robinson, the snake diet consists of only drinking a mixture of water, sea salt, potassium chloride, baking soda, and sulfate salts to keep your energy up. Fasts can last a day to as long as a month.

Zovel Olivia Hyre, 28, is a Markham-based medical student, former national soccer player and a member of a snake diet fasting group on Facebook. After gaining weight, Olivia Hyre decided she needed a detox or cleanse of some sort, and thought a fast would do the trick. She first decided to try a juice cleanse, but then moved on to intermittent fasting, but finally came across the snake diet online, but before she even decided to experiment with the trend, she spent hours reading on the subject and watching the founder’s explanatory videos that broke down the science behind the regime.

Once she was convinced, she began fasting a few days at a time and felt a major, positive difference in her health. She began sharing her journey with her Instagram followers, and saw there was a lot of interest on the topic, and that led to her coming across the International Facebook group in April.

“Through finding that support, you realize that there are other people willing to do what you think you’re isolated doing on your own, there are actually others out there that are very avid about it,” she says, adding that the group is valuable because it’s able to actually inform individuals who are in need of more guidance.

“If someone posts about feeling dizzy, people can quickly respond and say they need to simply up their electrolytes and it’s natural the first day or two,” she says. “But if someone’s been fasting for 30 days and says they feel terrible and are vomiting, that’s when a bunch of people often jump in and say—pull the brakes.”

Listening to your body is key with any new diet, especially when it involves fasting for a long period of time. When part of an online forum, it can be especially tempting to compare yourself to the slew of before and after photos, but that’s when things can go awry. Social dieting forums are a wonderful way to stay motivated, connect with other health fans and learn more about various lifestyles, but anything can gradually go from moderate to extreme.

“Healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle is an admirable thing to work towards, that sometimes does require social support to keep on track, but there’s also more adaptive ways of doing that,” says Stephanie Cassin, a Registered Clinical and Health Psychologist and director of Ryerson University’s Healthy Eating and Lifestyle Lab, emphasizing the importance of adapting a lifestyle that’s lenient and not too rigid in order for it to actually be healthy and sustainable.

In moderation, fasting has been scientifically proven to improve inflammation, blood pressure, brain function, and potentially even cancer prevention according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, but the main worry is what happens when it’s taken a step too far, especially when there’s a crowd of digital fans cheering you on.

“If somebody had a susceptibility or predisposition to an eating disorder, and they started on a really restrictive fast, that kind of short term impact on their actual weight can become quite reinforcing,” said Cassin. “Sometimes people with anorexia will say that it actually just started as a diet that went too far and just kind of got off track.”

When it comes to more severe diet plans like fasting, it’s important to listen to your body and gauge whether you’re doing it to reach your weight goal or to genuinely improve your health. Just because it worked well for one person’s body, doesn’t mean you will have the same success.

Another issue is the spreading of misinformation. Misinformation can proliferate on social media, and it can spread quickly. For example, one member of an intermittent fasting thread on reddit wanted to break down big pieces of misleading information that they’ve come across in the thread, but even their post was littered with errors. In response to a few posts about being overweight due to drinking alcohol, the user responded saying that “Beers are high in calories but you urinate out lots of alcohol as it is a diuretic, it’s not in your system long enough to really affect weight. The real reason is when you are drunk you make worse decisions. Pizza, kebabs, pasta.”

But while millions of opinionated people and a wide and open database would seem to be a recipe for inaccuracy, others argue that social media users tend to fact check each other. One recent post saw dozens of intermittent fasters in the same thread were quick to point out all the errors in the post, one even wrote, “When correcting people, anecdotes are no substitutes for actual sources. I think the term for this should be fastplaining.”

Sarah Black, a 44-year-old Bowmanville-raised massage therapist, has been fasting for more than 25 years and is also part of an intermittent fasting thread. During her time pursuing a diploma in massage therapy at Centennial College, Black also had to take courses in health and nutrition, but her interest in the topic dates back to when she was 16 and diagnosed with celiac disease. Reddit is the only social platform she likes to engage in because she feels misinformation gets clamped down a lot faster than on other platforms —especially by her. Her level of experience on the subject has led to her chiming in occasionally on the thread whenever she came across someone fasting in an unhealthy or extreme manner.

“I’ll pipe up here and there, but more so if I see something that’s blatant misinformation, or something that sounds like orthorexia (obsessive behaviour in pursuit of a healthy diet) or any approaches that are inherently unhealthy,” says Black. “I tend to get mixed reactions. People are sort of appreciative like, ‘Wow, I hadn’t really considered that part or idea to this,’ and then other folks will get kind of defensive, like, ‘Who are you to say this?’ I try to back it up with research if I can, but some of it’s anecdotal.”

For example, in mid-November, a reddit user posted a question into the thread enquiring how they could be adding more caffeine into their fasting routine. A few people, including Black, were quick to jump in and say it’s not healthy to add caffeine to a fasting diet due to it being a “diuretic” and the intense craving may be due to a caffeine addiction.

One thing Black said she’s noticed, especially among less experienced fasters is the habit of being “overzealous” and extreme.

“Some people tend to get very dogmatic with their approach and don’t take the time to really assess if something is healthy or is verging on being unhealthy,” she says. “A lot of people get so invested in the process, that they’re not actually honing in on how their bodies are feeling while they’re doing it.”",[],1431,0.9172720207197044

Next up: How do you juggle dieting with positive messages about body image?

Eating healthier can be hard, and harder still is the price tag that comes with eating more fresh vegetables, fish and whole grains, as the popular Mediterranean diet recommends.

“Out of all the diets, it’s the most sustainable,” says local holistic nutritionist and wellness expert, Jordana Hart. “The Mediterranean diet encourages people to eat real foods,” she says. It’s effective because it makes people feel nourished. “Some crash diets might be something someone can follow for two weeks; this is something someone can follow long term.”

While the Mediterranean diet is nothing new, if you live in Toronto, accessing it can be challenging and costly, as winter produce can be inconstant, and seafood has to travel long distances.

“We live in this world where people are eating a lot of processed food,” says Hart. “You can buy macaroni and cheese for 99 cents and call it dinner.” That said, the Mediterranean diet is manageable on almost any budget. “It just requires a bit more planning,” she says.

It also takes some added thought when shopping for the diet, says certified holistic nutritionist and best-selling author, Joy McCarthy. To keep costs accessible, McCarthy recommends emphasizing a lot of plant-based proteins like beans and legumes. “If you’re getting them dry and cooking them yourself, they’re one of the most inexpensive foods you can possibly buy,” she says. Don’t overlook frozen fruits and vegetables either. “I think people assume fresh is better, but we live in Canada and a lot of the foods here are imported anyways,” says Hart. The same goes for canned foods. “Instead of buying a fresh piece of tuna, you can buy canned tuna, salmon or anchovies. All of these canned fish are still high in nutrients and healthy fats,” she explains.

When buying fresh fish, thinking beyond tuna and salmon can drive down costs. “More affordable options would be proteins like West Coast or B.C. snapper,” says David Owen, owner of De La Mer Fresh Fish Market’s four locations. “It’s a Canadian fish that has a sweet flavour and firm but flakey texture like European sea bass and sea bream.” At about $10 a pound, tilapia is another great option according to Owen, who recommends it for fish tacos. “It’s relatively lean for those people who want a lower fat diet and it’s very mild, so good for kids,” he says. In terms of shellfish, Owen says mussels offer great bang for your buck. “There, you are looking in the ground beef bubble pricing. You can feed two people for like $7 or $8,” he says. Steaming mussels in white wine with garlic, shallots and diced tomatoes or cooking them in a green curry sauce makes for an easy and delicious meal says Owen.

Buying in season helps too. Depending on the time of year, McCarthy recommends farmer’s markets. “When zucchinis are in season, you can get one for less than $1,” she says as an example. It’s similar to buying in bulk. “Packaging can be 10-20 per cent of the cost, so if you’re buying dried chickpeas, mung beans or lentils, buy them in bulk not in a package,” says McCarthy. Lastly, keep an eye out for sales. “Every grocery store discounts from time to time to clear things out.”

Since the diet is flexible, places to shop for it are too. While McCarthy loves to support local independent businesses with great produce like the Sweet Potato, it’s not always the most cost-effective option. “I also like Organic Garage for things that are non-perishable or frozen,” says McCarthy. “No Frills actually has a huge organic section and very good prices. They also have a whole aisle of natural foods as well, which is very affordable,” she says. Both nutritionists agree that any major grocery store like Loblaws or superstore like Costco would be easy places to find everything needed for the diet too. Online, shoppers can buy produce through local delivery services like Mama Earth Organics, which partners with Ontario farms to deliver fresh and organic, vegetable and fruit baskets. Starting at $30 for a small sized bin, each order can be customized weekly based on consumer needs, so you’re getting high-quality in-season produce exactly when you need it.

Although the Mediterranean diet is high on simple unprocessed ingredients that doesn’t mean meals can’t be creative. McCarthy points to a lentil casserole and vegetable soup with beans and chilli as examples of hearty dishes that will keep you satisfied especially during cooler months. Sweets aren’t completely off the table either. “You can make something like an apple crisp, and if you didn’t want to use oats, you could do it with walnuts and seeds instead,” says Hart. Energy balls made with honey, oats and almond butter also make for great snacks she says.

McCarthy recommends batch cooking. “I’m a big fan of it because if you make it, you’ll have it for the whole week to enjoy,” she says. Like meal planning, batch cooking can help eliminate waste and cut down on costs. “Rather than buying new ingredients every day to make something, plan ahead and just know you’re making this vegetable casserole and meatballs,” adds Hart. “I find a lot of people buy groceries and don’t end up using them and that’s where the expense really is.”

Where Hart recommends investing more is on one particular Mediterranean diet staple. “Buying a good olive oil is very important,” she says. Shoppers should look for bottles that read “extra virgin olive oil.” It’s the best bang for your buck, because it has all the healthy fats with so many health benefits she advises. “Healthy fats are the building blocks for so much that goes on in our bodies. They create the healthy hormones responsible for mood and sleeping and help with memory and weight loss.”

The city’s newly opened Italian hot spot, Eataly, is an emporium for high-quality olive oils at all price points. “The Frantoi Cutrera Primo ($24.90) is made from the Tonda Iblea cultivar cultivated in a certified organic regime that received the BIO International prize in 2010 for the best organic olive oil,” says Dino Borri, VP of Global Partnerships at Eataly. “It’s fruity with intense hints of green tomato and fresh herbs plus a full-bodied flavour that lingers,” Borri continues. He suggests drizzling on soups and salads, but also on legumes, boiled rice and grilled vegetables. “One of Frantoio Franci’s most awarded oils from Tuscany, Villa Magra ($39.90) is intensely fruity with aromas of green olive, fresh and pungent grassy notes with hints of artichoke and elegant notes of roasted coffee,” he says. “Use this oil fresh in soups, on boiled or raw vegetables, bruschetta, red meats, tomato salads, with plain rice or pasta, as well as well-matured cheeses.”

“In the past 20 years alone, there have been so many fad diets, but the Mediterranean diet is more realistic because it incorporates all the essential foods into one place,” says Hart. It’s the diet’s flexibility rather than it’s hard and fast rules that make it so appealing. “It’s okay to make it your own,” says McCarthy.",[],1219,0.9333756347959445

This recipe is no exception, but here’s a surprise: the squash in this recipe is actually an essential part of why this dish is so beloved by kids. Well, my kids anyway. The great thing about butternut squash is how sweet and creamy it becomes once it’s cooked. In this recipe, the squash also soaks up the irresistible flavours of leeks, onions and garlic sautéed in butter. This is such a fragrant dish (the whole house will smell like garlic butter!) that you won’t even really need cheese. But I would make it au gratin, so the kids will gobble it up.

Squash and Leek Rigatoni au Gratin

4 cups (600 g) peeled, seeded and cubed butternut squash

2 tbsp (30 mL) olive oil

3/4 lb (375 g) rigatoni

3 cups (285 g) thinly sliced leeks (about 1 or 2)

1 small onion, chopped

2 cloves garlic, chopped

1/4 cup (55 g) butter

1/4 cup (40 g) unbleached all-purpose flour

2 cups (500 mL) chicken broth

1 cup (250 mL) milk

8 cups (240 g) lightly packed fresh spinach, stemmed and coarsely chopped (2 bags of 6 oz / 170 g)

Red pepper flakes (optional)

Grated nutmeg (optional)

1 cup (100 g) grated cheddar cheese

1/2 cup (35 g) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Salt and pepper

1. With the rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 400F (200C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Place the squash on the baking sheet. Drizzle with the oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake for about 20 minutes or until tender, stirring halfway through cooking. Set aside.

3. Meanwhile, in a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the pasta al dente. Drain. Lightly oil and set aside.

4. In the same pot over medium-high heat, soften the leeks, onion and garlic in the butter. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add the broth and milk. Bring to a boil. Simmer for 5 minutes.

5. Off the heat, with an immersion blender, purée the leek mixture until smooth. With a spatula, stir in the squash, pasta and spinach. Adjust the seasoning. Add a pinch of red pepper flakes and nutmeg, if desired.

6. Pour the mixture into a 13 x 9-inch (33 x 23 cm) baking dish. Sprinkle with the cheeses. Bake for about 25 minutes or until golden brown. Let rest for 15 minutes before serving.",[],428,0.9879640726313393

But there’s a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. Here’s the lowdown.

When you don’t care that the ice will dilute the wine as it melts, or that the deep chill is going to mask all the subtle complexity in the wine, go ahead and toss a few cubes in the glass. Otherwise, refrain.

My bet is, if you’ve dropped a generous bundle of cash on a bottle of fine wine, you’re not going to want to wreck it by watering it down and muting it. Which is why serving fine wine on the rocks is not usually a good idea. But there’s one exception.

And that’s Port. That sweet, fortified wine from Portugal that’s typically associated with Christmas gifting, by-the-fire sipping and post-dinner cheese boards is actually quite fabulous in the summer served on ice. Especially with a dish of salted almonds. Here’s why it works.

First off, Port is so concentrated that a little dilution isn’t going to kill the experience. In fact, it will actually enhance its drinkability.

Secondly, ice ratchets up the refreshment factor and offsets the style’s considerable sweetness.

And third, at about 20 per cent alcohol by volume, Port is a slow sipper. So it has time to warm up a little bit in your mouth as you drink it, giving the considerable complexity time to open, cascade and linger — even when served cold.

All that to say, if you haven’t tried Port on the rocks, I’d encourage you to do so with a bottle of white, tawny or ruby Port. Here are a few favourites that offer tremendous value.

White wine lovers will appreciate Taylor Fladgate NV Fine White Port (Vintages 69856, $15.95/750mL). Gleaming golden in the glass, this is a sweet, full-bodied wine made from a blend of eight white grape varieties and aged in wood for three years. Each sip saturates the palate with a blast of candied pear and orange zest, salted caramel and hazelnut, vanilla and a whisper of nutmeg. This is especially good served with a slice of orange in the glass. Score: 93

A tasty tawny to try is Warre’s Otima 10-Year-Old (LCBO 566174, $22.00/500mL). Tawny Ports are red fortified wines that have shed their deep ruby colour and turned amber, or tawny, from maturing in wood for an extended time. This version, comprised of wine aged an average of 10 years in oak, shines a deep amber hue and tastes of toffee and nuts, candied citrus and cherries, with touches of nutmeg, clove and cinnamon. It’s a sweet, satin-textured drink that goes well with the setting sun. Score: 92+

For a ruby Port that overdelivers, consider Taylor Fladgate 2015 Late Bottled Vintage Port (LCBO 46946, $19.00/750mL). Ruby Port is made from a blend of black grape varieties aged for two to six years in wood, thus retaining its deep colour. Taylor Fladgate’s version here shines dark red and unfolds with intriguing layers of fruit that taste sweet and poised yet dark. Blackberry and black licorice mingle with black cherry and cola, burnt almond and coffee, and a whisper of black peppercorn and smoke. And it’s of course long. Score: 93

If you’re inspired to whip up a batch of salted almonds to go with any of these wines, here’s my favourite way to make them.

Pour three cups of raw, unsalted almonds into a bowl. Dissolve one heaping teaspoon of salt in about two tablespoons of hot water. Pour the salty water over the almonds and toss. Spread the nuts on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a 400° F oven for about 10 minutes until golden, stirring halfway through. Remove the tray from the oven, pour the almonds into a bowl, drizzle them with about a tablespoon of really good olive oil and stir to coat. The nuts will quickly absorb the oil.

You can serve the almonds warm or let them cool and store them in an airtight container.

And if you’ve got a bottle of fine table wine kicking around that you want to chill fast, don’t be tempted to throw ice in the glass. Instead, make an ice bath — about half ice, half water — and submerge the bottle. Doing so will chill it faster than ice on its own and you’ll be enjoying your wine nicely chilled (but not too cold or diluted) in no time.",[],765,0.9849133306426814

This roundup of some of the best offers out there will keep you drinking well at the best possible price, while supporting Ontario producers.

One of the smartest deals is from Pillitteri Estates Winery in Niagara. It’s selling its 2019 Canadian Gothic White VQA Ontario for $99.00 per case of 12 bottles, reg. $156.00, and waiving the shipping fee within Ontario. This wine is normally only available at farmers’ markets, but it can now be purchased online at pillitteri.com for what works out to $8.25 per bottle. That price for a delicious local white is a steal.

The 2019 Canadian Gothic White is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio and Gewurztraminer. It swirls with aromas and flavours of dried apricot and sun-drenched grapefruit, then it shifts toward tangerine zest, lemon curd, wildflowers and rose before leaving a crushed stone and salt finish. Taut, shimmering acidity hems in the effusive off-dry fruit. And this light-bodied, honest value white clocks a relatively low 12 per cent alcohol. Outstanding value for money. Score: 93

Here’s an insider tip for those enamoured by mineral-driven, dry styles of Chardonnay. Bachelder Niagara has just released a brilliant bottle to consumers, which is normally reserved for its restaurant clients—who would of course mark it up considerably. It’s the 2018 Minéralité de Niagara VQA Niagara Peninsula. They’re selling it for $22.95 at BachelderNiagara.com and waiving the shipping fee within Ontario for three bottles or more. That wine is deeply undervalued for what it is.

The attack is quick and racy, instantly mouthwatering. Then it fills out, broadens, and saturates with a powerful punch of luminosity that seems to glow in the mouth. Glossy mouthfeel, citric zeal, stone, salt, sweet butter, a touch of mushroom maybe—it’s all there. Then, it tapers to a resounding finish of grapefruit—flesh and peel—that goes on for ages. This wine will astound and amaze those with a thing for fine, mineral-driven, focused whites. Though marketed as a summer sipper, this wine will lift and tune the senses 12 months of the year.

From Prince Edward County, Rosehall Run Vineyards offers a mixed six-pack of rosés valued at $160.00 for $125.00, with free shipping anywhere in Ontario. And they’re throwing in four GoVino wine glasses—those shatterproof, reusable and recyclable plastic glasses with a cult-like following.

The six pack—available at rosehallrun.com—includes two bottles each of the 2019 Just One Rosé and the NV Pixie Sparkling Rosé, which are both VQA Ontario. And it includes one bottle each of the 2019 Rosé of Pinot Noir and the 2019 Pét-Nat, both from Prince Edward County. Each of the four wines offers an interesting variation on the rosé theme.

The 2019 Just One Rosé is a dry Gamay seasoned with a touch of Pinot Noir and a dash of Zweigelt. It shines sunset pink in the glass and rivets the senses with bright, forthright flavours of raspberry-lemonade—without the sweetness. It’s the kind of drink you’ll want to enjoy chilled on a porch swing in the country somewhere—but your balcony or back garden will do too. Score: 91

The coral-tinted NV Pixie Sparkling Rosé with its boho-label is made from Vidal and Pinot Noir and unfolds with sheer, off-dry flavours of wild strawberry and lemon-lime before the soft peach and cranberry undertow emerges along the length of the finish. It’s a well-balanced quencher with great purity of fruit. Score: 91

The salmon-hued 2019 Rosé of Pinot Noir tastes dry and crisp—a bit more serious, really—with understated flavours of violet, raspberry, beetroot and stone. It would work very nicely with grilled salmon or a mushroom quiche. Score: 89

And the 2019 Pét-Nat is a curiosity more than anything. Pét-Nat is short for Pétillant Naturel, a style of sparkling wine made by bottling the wine mid-fermentation. Doing so traps the carbon dioxide in the bottle while the remaining yeast gives the wine a cloudy appearance while adding complexity. This bottle is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Gamay, Riesling, Pinot Noir, and other varieties, and the result is a fizzy, hazy pink wine with flavours of mixed red berries, salted lemon zest, crumbled herbs, cranberry, and many other nuances. It’s tasty, but there’s also a certain rusticity about it. Score: 88

And for those looking for a six pack with a white, rosé and red tucked inside should look to Marynissen Estates Winery in Niagara. This producer now offers two bottles each of its 2019 Heritage Collection “Charmed” Sparkling VQA Ontario, 2019 Rosé VQA Niagara Peninsula, and 2017 Heritage Collection “Nanny’s Blend” Red VQA Niagara Peninsula. The six-pack is $99.95, regularly $135.70, and is available at marynissen.com. And they’re waiving the shipping fee in Ontario.

The 2019 Heritage Collection “Charmed” Sparkling is a lovely blend of Riesling, Gewurztraminer and Muscat that tastes off-dry and elegant. It starts with the compelling scent of French lemon tart. The attack is brisk and lively with a mouthfilling hit of lemon lime and chin-drip peach laced with a touch of cool stone minerality on the finish. And the hint of sweetness is balanced by bracing acidity, so each sip finishes clean and dry. Great value. Score: 93

The 2019 Rosé is a riveting blend of Riesling, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Muscat. This cheerful, off-dry style offers immediate pleasure with quenching flavours of yellow plum, ruby grapefruit, and tangy raspberry. Lots of levity and oodles of clean, bright fruit. Score: 90

If you’d asked for a fizz, say, 100 years ago, the bartender would have handed you a gin cocktail, since the Gin Fizz was one of the most popular drinks of the day.

What made it so popular? Aside from being delicious and refreshing, having a carbonated cocktail was still a bit of a novelty. Carbonated water was invented in the 1700s, but it wasn’t until the soda siphon (a.k.a. a seltzer bottle, that made water fizzy with carbon dioxide cartridges) became widely available and affordable that bubbly cocktails became common. For home bartenders, that was in the 1920s.

Fancy bars had carbonated water for making sparkling cocktails earlier. One of the most famous and flashy fizzy cocktails was the Ramos Gin Fizz, which was invented in New Orleans in 1888 at the Imperial Cabinet Saloon and, within 20 years of its creation, had become a veritable cottage industry. Some of its appeal was the spectacle of teams of bartenders shaking fizzes for exceptionally long times, which was part of the secret to getting a frothy top.

The other part of the trick was adding an egg white, which, when added to a drink and shaken, turns foamy, pretty much the same way an egg white turns into meringue when whisked. The final touch comes from adding soda water at the end, which, just like a soda fountain drink, makes the bubbles rise even higher.

Because it contains cream, the Ramos Gin Fizz, is really an indulgent boozy soda fountain drink. It’s delicious, but it’s next-level cocktail-shaking and I prefer to steer clear of dairy in the hot summer months, so I thought it best to use a different Fizz for this column. There are plenty of options, since the family includes at least a dozen different recipes. Some people even include the Mojito and Tom Collins in the family. I have a soft spot for the Silver Gin Fizz—gin, lemon, egg white, sugar and soda water.

For this 100-mile version of the recipe, we’ve tweaked this classic slightly by using lime instead of lemon and Beattie’s Farm Crafted Potato Gin ($39.95; LCBO 645622), which is distilled from potatoes in Alliston, Ontario. It’s a neat distillery, since they use the odd-sized potatoes (chip industry rejects) to make vodka and gin, so it’s part of the zero-waste movement, too.

2 oz Beattie’s Gin

1 oz lime juice

1 egg white

2 teaspoons special fine granulated sugar

1 tiny pinch of salt

Add ice, gin, juice, salt, sugar and egg white to a cocktail shaker and shake rigorously for 60 seconds—until the shaker is ice-cold. Strain into a tall glass with four or five ice cubes. Slowly pour soda water to make it froth up.

PRO TIP: Many bartenders keep a small bottle of saline solution at their stations and add a couple of drops to a range of cocktails, including the Fizz. It’s used for the same reason it is in baking, namely, that it helps bring out flavour. A lot of cocktail technique is actually pretty similar to baking, such as the use of egg whites or specific grades of sugar. Cocktail recipes may seem finnicky but, details are important. Special fine granulated sugar, for example, is much easier to dissolve in the cold shaking process than the normal granulated sugar you stir into your coffee.",[],589,0.9878473851753709

It’s worth noting that they weren’t in the pink for long. It was only last summer, really, when we saw everyone, from behemoths like Beefeater to local craft producers like Willibald Farm Distillery, launch a pink gin. This year, judging from the new gins at the LCBO, well, orange is the new pink. Life moves at you pretty fast in the liquor world.

From my point of view, this is a good turn of events. The pink-gin craze was largely inspired by the phenomenal success of Empress 1908, a blue gin from Victoria, B.C., that turns pink when you add tonic or citrus. This colour-changing trick is the result of butterfly pea flower but, other than that additive, it was still a proper gin. Many of the pink gins that followed in its footsteps, however, also had a lot of added flavour and sugar. Some had as much as 70 grams of sugar per litre, which verges on being a gin liqueur, as opposed to a spirit.

Unlike the pinks, most of the orange gins have little to no added sugar. And, having tasted all the ones I can find at the LCBO, I can say that they’re all also pretty delicious. Not all are orange (sometimes it’s just the bottle), and that’s just fine with me.

What follows is a little roundup, from blood orange to Valencia oranges, with a little explainer on how to best enjoy them, since there’s a surprisingly wide range of flavour profiles involved.

Most people know blood oranges for their colour first and flavour second, but with the hue-free and aromatic Whitley Neill Blood Orange Gin ($44.95; LCBO 14754), it’s all about the taste. It’s got a bold, candied-orange peel flavour, but with none of the candy sweetness, making it pretty easy to pair with ginger ale or tonic. Our favourite way, by far, to drink this is to turn it into a Blood Orange Negroni — equal parts Campari, sweet vermouth and this gin, stirred and strained into a glass filled with ice. No garnish required.

Since Tanqueray Flor de Sevilla ($30.95; LCBO 573956) is the sweetest of the six at the LCBO, the best way to serve this is to keep it simple — on the rocks with a spritz of soda. One of the nicest things about this light-coloured gin is that you can still taste the juniper through the delicate Seville-orange flavour, so you don’t want to drown it with mix. Two parts gin, one part soda and a wedge of lemon is all it needs.

If it weren’t for the fact that this is a full-strength spirit, Beefeater Blood Orange ($30.45; LCBO 15765) could pass for a punchy Italian aperitivo such as Aperol. It’s brightly coloured and has flavour to spare, so it will hold its own in a champagne cocktail like a modified French 75 — one ounce this gin and four ounces cava or other sparkly wine. Of course, gin and bubbly wine is a powerfully dangerous combo, so, if you want to tone it down a little, it’s also delicious with Lemon Tonic — one part spirit, three parts tonic.

Made with Sicilian oranges, Malfy Gin con Arancia ($39.70; LCBO 10715) is dry and lively with a complex blend of bitter and spicy notes — frankly delicious. You could stir this over ice and turn it into a lovely Martini with a twist of lemon to fully appreciate its sophisticated flavour profile, or pair it with a straightforward tonic water, such as Fever-Tree Mediterranean.

They call the region south of Barcelona the “orange blossom coast” for its ample sweet-orange groves, which provide the inspiration for Botica Valencian Orange Gin ($42.45; LCBO 12668), an international collaboration between folks in Spain and the Netherlands. It’s gin first, orange second, which is also just fine with us — especially mixed with grapefruit and soda water (two parts gin, two parts fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, one part soda).

You can’t really call Hendrick’s Midsummer Solstice ($59.70; LCBO 12564) an “orange gin” per se, since this colour-free botanical-forward gin also showcases fresh berry and floral flavours, but there’s a distinct orange-peel finish that we think qualifies it for inclusion. Like all Hendrick’s products, this is a crowd-pleaser, that becomes even more of an easy-drinking refresher when you add a little Elderflower Tonic. Also makes a great Martini.

Especially lately, since the drink has gone from a dusty old curiosity to a “call drink” — cocktails that aren’t necessarily on the menu, but get ordered by customers anyway. A couple of years ago, bartenders reported that the Old Fashioned was overtaking the vodka soda as the top call drink on King West.

So, if the Old Fashioned is so great, why did it need to stage a comeback? Well, for decades, the original cocktail lost its way as the Fruit Old Fashioned gained popularity. An Old Fashioned is basically just sweetened, slightly bittered, diluted whisky served over ice and garnished with an orange peel, but at some point people decided to take it up a notch by muddling fruit into the drink. That, in itself, wasn’t such a terrible idea. Unfortunately, one of the “fruits” involved was the maraschino cherry.

I once saw a bartender take a scoop of bright red Day-Glo cherries and toss them in the bottom of a glass, along with a few slices of orange, smash them up, then add ice, simple syrup and whisky. It was … not good.

Fortunately, as more and more bartenders started researching bygone recipes, a more minimalist Old Fashioned was revived. It became especially popular once people realized that it was more than a recipe, but rather a method that could be applied to just about any spirit. Once you master the basics, you can make it with rum, brandy, tequila or even gin.

Here, though, we are making it with Canadian whisky, since that’s a delicious spirit — and barrels of it are being made within 100 miles, right here in southern Ontario.

Old Fashioned

2 oz Canadian whisky

1 sugar cube

5 dashes Angostura bitters

1 oz soda water

Orange peel (1 inch by 2 inches)

Method: Place the sugar cube in an Old Fashioned lowball glass. Douse the sugar in bitters, add soda and start muddling until the sugar is dissolved. Add whisky and a couple of large ice cubes and stir for 30 seconds. Express the oils from the orange peel and serve. Or drink.

Tip: Bartenders pay a lot of attention to ice for a simple reason — rate of dilution. Spirit-forward drinks are generally served on one or two large cubes that don’t melt as quickly, since oversized ice keeps the drink from becoming watered down. Jumbo ice-cube trays can be bought at cocktail supply shops like Toronto’s Cocktail Emporium.",[],433,0.9869119845635098

After three days seated at my dining room table, watching what was effectively Quibi for fashion — which is to say, the first streamed digital couture “shows,” forced online by the coronavirus pandemic and transformed into bite-size nuggets that ranged from ersatz music videos to schmaltzy short films and previews for collections to come — I’m starting to wonder.

Yes, everyone gets to watch what was formerly an entirely exclusive, just-for-insiders, demonstration of fabulousness. That’s a good thing.

But honestly, give me the runway.

I never thought I would write those words. Like many, I have complained about the waste involved in fashion weeks: all those people flying around the world to sit twiddling their thumbs waiting for a show to start while ogling the celebrities across the catwalk, most of whom are dressed in full-blown evening clothes at 10 a.m., surrounded by elaborate sets made to be demolished after 20 minutes, all in the service of (in the case of the July shows) a parade of insanely expensive handmade clothes for the very few. Nero, meet your fiddle and all that.

But what this whole digital experiment ultimately revealed is that, though music and movies have been using fashion to their own ends for decades now, reversing the equation doesn’t really work.

Not even when you rope in a famous film director, as Dior did with Matteo Garrone, the Italian auteur behind “Pinocchio” and “Dogman.” And give him carte blanche to make … a mash-up of myths involving mermaids, Narcissus, satyrs, bellboys and nymphs who really, really, want to wear lamé goddess gowns and wafting, feathered coats instead of barely there bits of chiffon. Not even when you team up with a cult-y musician, like Olivier Theyskens did with Sylvie Kreusch of Warhaus, for his debut at Azzaro couture, all rhinestone siren slinkiness balanced on a knife-edge just this side of kitsch.

Not even when you get a famous actress, as Iris van Herpen did with Carice van Houten, formerly the Red Priestess on “Game of Thrones,” and have her animate a single look that plays with your sense of perception in odd angles and cuts, so it seems to grow around her body like a nimbus of rebirth.

Not even when you dress up well-known models and convince them to do awkward dancing, as if they were punk princesses at the famous Parisian disco Le Palace, while wearing bejeweled bouclé and lavishly flounced taffeta, as Chanel did.

It feels inauthentic: a copy of an idea from another creative discipline. And the problems of couture are not so much financial (most of the brands that can afford couture have enough of a cash cushion to survive the current situation and someone, somewhere, is still buying it) as existential. With the dire state of the world, what’s the point?

There’s an electricity to a live event, with its sense of shared experience and risk, that answers that question and cannot be replicated in the vacuum of the internet. There’s a specificity to a fashion show, a rhythm in the entrances and exits and struts, a duet between body and cloth, that has its own cadence and offers its own implicit thesis about the costumes IRL, which loses its force when it gets moved to an URL. It’s too easy to look away. To roll your eyes. And giggle.

Well, now we know. And it’s not actually a judgment on the clothes themselves, anyway. It’s a judgment on the context.

When is a show not really a show?

In any case, thinking of these digital shows as shows is probably wrong in the first place. They were more like a joint declaration of belief: We’re still here!

(That’s why, even though it didn’t have an actual show, Maison Margiela offered up a 48-second lava lamp of a show trailer, starring the vamping model Leon Dame suggesting the form of a longer … something … to be a revealed July 16. Ditto Valentino, which clocked in at just over a minute with its hypnotically morphing single piece of fabric/promo for a July 21 show. They wanted to show their faith in the official couture organization, even though their main events are later.)

After all, fashion, like so many industries, is in crisis as a result of the coronavirus pandemic: stores shuttered, fabric mills closed, brands declaring bankruptcy. To dare, in the face of a lockdown that separated designers from their ateliers, to create any form of a collection for public consumption is a kind of triumph: an aria of optimism into the void, a testament to imagination and ingenuity.

And in fact, the videos that revealed just that — bringing the viewer inside the creation process — were the ones that hinted at couture’s true magic. Ironically, it’s the documentaries that may actually best convey the “dream” that is couture: the handwork and humanity woven into its seams.

So while Dior’s movie was misguided escapism (verging on the objectionable, thanks to an entirely white cast, which is the dream of exactly who these days?), its opening scenes, which took place in the ateliers, were irresistible. They showcased the fact that the collection — the gold Aphrodite dress with its flowing cape, the sunburst-shirred high-collar white shirt and a pale-pink halter-neck ball gown covered in beaded branches — had actually been created in miniature, scaled down to 40 per cent of a traditional toile to create a treasure chest of a collection that will later travel the world for clients to ogle and order (full-size, of course).

Designer Maria Grazia Chiuri had been inspired by Le Théâtre de la Mode, a travelling exhibition of 150 dolls created in 1945 by designers of the day such as Lucien Lelong, Schiaparelli and Jeanne Lanvin as a way to revive couture in a post-Second World War world and rescue the fashion industry from economic ruin and emotional despair. You can understand it: what worked once, might well work again.

Especially when close-ups of the 2020 versions revealed the careful artistry of the petites mains (little hands) that made them, the camera watching an artisan painstakingly using a tiny needle to create the fringing on the hemline of the moonlit gown.

Just as it was charming, if not entirely satisfying, to look over the shoulder of Daniel Roseberry of Schiaparelli as he sat sketching away on his “imaginary collection” in Washington Square Park, near the New York apartment where he was sheltering in place, drawing tape measure straps, power shoulders and zeppelin-size balloon sleeves (for looks that will be made later this year). And to have sneak peeks from Ulyana Sergeenko and Elie Saab at the hands transforming basic materials into extraordinary embroidery for their somewhat overblown creations. Even if all the soft focus nature that followed mostly called to mind a perfume commercial.

Up close and at home

They all made me long for more such intimate experiences: not just to goggle at the flotillas of tulle and cloqué of Giambattista Valli, with their exclamation points of bows both large and small (look: a swan! and look: a white taffeta bow as big as a torso atop a white chiffon dress as tiny as Joan Smalls’ waist!) but to understand how they are constructed. Though to be fair, at least with his video, you could see the clothes instead of just the mood.

To really understand the Chanel collection, for example, which ultimately looked a whole lot better than designer Virginie Viard’s recent stabs at half-hearted casual couture, you had to eschew the live action for the static lookbook: 30 styles versus the short’s five, including some lavishly restrained midnight blue gowns and not-quite-understated armorial tweed jackets.

In any case, only Viktor & Rolf managed to capture the absurdity of the whole exercise: us, sitting in our rooms around the world, staring into small screens by ourselves, mesmerized (or not) by well-intentioned efforts to elicit asynchronous rapture.

They did it with a five-minute play in three acts titled “change” (small c, all in gold balloons) that spliced the classic department store show with today’s working-from-home ethos, with a stentorian voice-over by the singer Mika and a heavy dose of levity.

See, for example, an empire-waist sapphire satin negligee spotted with lace storm clouds to reflect “a feeling of sadness and anger familiar to many these days.” Or the pale pink chemises adorned with “contradictory emoji,” the “frantically entangled” sashes swirling around enormous bathrobe coats, and the enveloping A-line silhouettes to guarantee “you will remain in your own safe zone while venturing out into the world.”

There was a lot more like that. “If only we could change ourselves as easily as we do our outfits,” said Mika. That is, of course, the promise of all this; the beauty is that we all keep hoping.

It just seems so much more convincing from the ballroom chairs.",[],1485,0.923058806000112

Allaire, who is Ojibway, is the fashion and style writer at Vogue. When his first Indigenous-focused fashion article for the venerable fashion title, “How 6 Indigenous Designers Are Using Fashion to Reclaim Their Future” went live, Indigenous people sent him a over a hundred tweets, DMs and comments.

“It opened the floodgates. I started receiving a ton of pitches and started being introduced to so many great new artists and designers,” says the writer by phone, from his parents’ home in Nipissing, Ontario, where he’s riding out COVID-19. “Indigenous designers don’t get the same coverage as others, so once we saw that it resonated, and there was talent out there to write about, I just really ran with it, which is a dream.”

Speaking about fashion, Allaire is simultaneously funny and serious, admitting that he thought he’d be in Ontario for a weekend and only packed two wild printed shirts and jeans. Three months later, “This is not the look,” he jokes.

Allaire can trace his love of fashion to cultural events and powwows he attended on his home community of Nipissing First Nation in Ontario. Years later, ignited by beautiful regalia at powwows, he decided to pursue a career in fashion journalism.

“I knew that it was a very competitive field and what sets me apart from the thousand other fashion writers out there [is that] I come from a culture that really is not respected in the fashion industry and their designs are often appropriated or copied without any recognition,” he says. “I write about authentic design and what that means today. A lot of people think it’s an old, traditional bygone craft, but there’s still designers doing it today. I knew from day one that’s what I was going to do.”

At Ryerson University in Toronto, Allaire was determined to get his fashionable feet in the door and aggressively pursued internships, completing several stints at Flare and Interview magazines, with the latter bringing him to New York City, his new home.

After covering New York and Milan fashion weeks and interviewing Christian Louboutin for Footwear News, Allaire went freelance in 2017. Soon after, an opportunity opened on Vogue’s production team during fashion month. The month-long gig involved tasks like building online galleries for runway shows. The next fashion season, he returned to do it again.

“I just sort of stuck around,” he recalls, beginning with working for the site as a contract writer before transitioning to a full-time employee for the digital arm of Vogue last summer. His first print piece, on Choctaw artist Jeffrey Gibson, appeared in the May 2020 issue. He captioned his Instagram post on the achievement as “Baby’s first print story!”

“I think I’ve gotten to where I am based on two things: hard work and luck. I have always been driven and always took internships whenever I could, started writing for free, networked my ass off. But every job I have gotten has also been thanks to the relationships I built and just good timing in general,” says the 28-year-old.

The Vogue gig has brought Allaire to the Met Gala twice, and he made sure to wear an Indigenous-made piece at the huge fashion event, a custom-made red beaded flower pin made by Toronto-based Skye Paul of Running Fox Beads, for the 2019 theme of Camp. “It would be campy for me to wear something very traditional, which was beadwork in my eyes, in a new fun way, so I paired it with a frilly shirt and sequined boots.”

Allaire jokingly likens picking his favourite designers to that of “picking a favourite child.” Still, his eye for beautiful work and understanding of the culture has brought incredible designers like Jamie Okuma, Warren Steven Scott, Keri Ataumbi, Liandra Swim and Tania Larsson into the fashion conversation. Although it has long upheld Western-centric notions of fashion, a name like Vogue still carries the kind of mainstream legitimacy that money can’t buy and can bring invaluable awareness to designers.

Allaire has recently covered Indigenous designers from South Africa and Australia, as the publication broadens its coverage of brands outside of North America. “It’s American Vogue and we will obviously spotlight American designers, but I think people are interested in hearing about brands from countries that they don’t live in. Shopping is not focused on where you live but on your emotional ties to a designer’s story.”

Sharing those stories will be something he’ll continue to do. “Indigenous brands seem like such a small market, but I literally can’t keep up.” In May, Allaire included 15 Indigenous designers in a story on sustainable fashion. One of those designers was Tania Larsson, a Gwich’in fine jewelry designer from Yellowknife. “He is a person who is changing our history,” Larsson says by phone “He’s impacting us in such a huge way, and I know that it’s going to ripple through ages.”

The writer, meanwhile, often underestimates the profound effect his stories have but does admit to frequently hearing about the significance of his stories from the people he covers and readers alike. “I want to give a platform for the voices who haven’t really been heard. There’s always a new brand, and that’s inspiring because it means that someone can feel more confident than ever to pursue fashion design and find resources.”

For Larsson, Allaire’s work goes beyond fashion. “It’s like sharing our culture, which for the longest time has been under attack.” With Allaire on Vogue’s masthead, representation of Indigenous designers can finally turn a new page.",[],937,0.9574350333249382

Researchers from the Ottawa Hospital say they want to explore the potential of IMM-101, a preparation featuring a dead pathogen containing properties that can stimulate the “first-response arm” of the immune system.

Study lead Dr. Rebecca Auer, surgical oncologist and director of cancer research at the Ottawa Hospital, says it could help experts understand why some COVID-19 patients are relatively asymptomatic while others end up in intensive care or die.

“The difference, it seems, between these two different presentations has to do with how strong your innate, or your sort of non-specific, first-line defence immune system response is to the virus,” Auer said Wednesday.

“And so we’re hoping that by boosting and stimulating this innate immune response, particularly in those vulnerable patients that have a reduced immune response to begin with, we’d be able to prevent symptomatic infections and prevent serious infections.”

Cancer patients are at much higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19 because chemotherapy, cancer surgery and radiation treatments suppress innate immunity even further.

Auer points to an “urgent need” to protect them while the world waits for an effective COVID-19 vaccine, which could take another year or more to develop, test and implement.

A successful trial could also protect cancer patients against other respiratory infections as well as the coming flu season, says Auer, noting the threat of illness is a fairly big problem for those undergoing treatment.

“A study demonstrated that about 13 to 15 per cent of cancer patients will have to delay or stop their treatment because of influenza during the average flu season,” she says.

“And also, cancer patients don’t respond as well to the influenza vaccine every year because their immune system isn’t as strong. So we think that the IMM-101 may in itself be able to help prevent symptomatic influenza infections.”

Auer says IMM-101 has also been tested elsewhere for its anti-cancer properties and that, too, will be examined in this trial, although it’s not the primary objective.

The researchers say the bacteria, Mycobacterium obuense, is safe to use in cancer patients because it has been killed by heat.

The Canadian study will recruit 1,500 patients currently receiving cancer treatment, and participants will be randomly assigned to receive either regular care or regular care plus IMM-101.

Auer says the treatment would be administered as an injection in the arm, to be followed by two more booster shots.

Researchers will follow patients for a year, watching for any respiratory infections and monitoring whether the treatment works and how long it lasts.

The trials will take place in eight centres located in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec.

Researchers say people interested in participating should speak with their cancer specialist.

Researchers from the Ottawa Hospital came up with the idea and worked with the Canadian Cancer Trials Group at Queen’s University to design the trial.

Dr. Chris O’Callaghan of the Queen’s University group notes cancer patients are also at greater risk of COVID-19 infection because they require regular medical care, making it difficult to adhere fully to public health guidelines.

“These patients are unable to practise social isolation due to the need to regularly attend hospital to receive critically important cancer treatment,” says O’Callaghan, who will oversee the trial.

Auer says a successful trial of IMM-101 could also suggest usefulness in treating any patient with a reduced innate immune system, such as older patients with chronic illness.

She notes that the tuberculosis vaccine known as BCG — which uses a similar formulation to IMM-101 but uses live bacteria instead of dead bacteria — is being tested around the world to see if it can boost the immunity of health-care workers exposed to COVID-19.

Funding and in-kind support, valued at $2.8 million, comes from the Canadian Cancer Society, BioCanRx, the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, the Ottawa Hospital Foundation, the Ottawa Hospital Academic Medical Organization, ATGen Canada/NKMax and Immodulon Therapeutics, the manufacturer of IMM-101.",[],675,0.9679743723290974

Anecdotally speaking, it would appear so. I know night owls who’ve become early risers, friends suffering from insomnia for the first time and have heard plenty of stories about vivid COVID-19 dreams. I’ve even spoken to people who, freed from the tyranny of their alarm clocks, are finally getting a proper night’s sleep for the first time in their adult lives.

We need more than anecdotes to know if the pandemic is really making a difference in people’s sleep patterns—for better or worse. Fortunately, there’s an international study in the works, being run by sleep experts from 14 countries around the world that will analyze the responses from tens of thousands of participants to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on sleep and circadian rhythms in adults.

The study is still underway (Canadians have until July 15 to participate in the survey) and we won’t see results published for many months. So, it’s still too early to call it, but the researcher heading up the Canadian chapter, Dr. Frances Chung, suspects we’re going to find dramatic changes.

“I think the pandemic is really affecting people emotionally and it's very challenging for everyone because of the increased stress and anxiety,” says Chung, a Professor of the Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine at the University Health Network and University of Toronto. “So there’ll be increasing levels of irrational fears and also depression. And, you know, also we’re not going out and not doing exercise and regular things, that will all affect sleep.”

One COVID-19 habit, in particular, worries Chung, namely, watching 24-hour cable news channels and “doom-scrolling” on Twitter and other platforms that feed us a constant barrage of bad news, from rising coronavirus numbers around the world to murder hornets and anti-maskers. Obviously, reading a lot of terrifying things all the time isn’t a likely path to sweet dreams.

Even worse, though, is checking your feeds and/or watching CNN right before bed—and not just because it’s hard to doze off with murder hornets on the brain. Doom-scrolling is actually double trouble, since the news is bad, plus the blue light emitted from these screens interferes with your “circadian rhythms.” I decided to ask Greg Wells, PhD and author of “Rest, Refocus, Recharge: A Guide for Optimizing Your Life,” why that was so important.

“All humans have a circadian rhythm, which is a 24-hour cycle that sees our physiology change throughout,” explains Wells. “A lot of that is guided by a structure inside the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is sensitive to light and so, as the light becomes brighter, we become more alert and, as it gets darker, we sleep.”

He continues: “Blue light is wonderful in the morning and is very helpful to wake us up and get us going but, late in the evening, it activates the brain and makes it hard to get to sleep.”

Simple enough. And so is the solution. Wells says we need to protect ourselves from that and create a “digital sunset.” Thirty to 60 minutes before bed, he advises we turn off the devices, turn down the lights and read a book or take a bath or meditate or whatever. That will put your brain in a place where it can release melatonin, the hormone that helps us fall asleep quickly and deeply. Wells says we need to “defend our last hour from tech.”

Unless you have a serious sleep disorder, this might not seem like a top priority. A lot of emerging evidence, however, shows that sleep plays an important role in keeping us healthy and happy.

“I think most of us did not realize sleep was so important, but sleep actually affects the body’s whole health system,” says Chung. “If you sleep less than six hours a night, it increases your risk for obesity by 21 per cent, your risk for stroke by 22 per cent, your risk for diabetes by 25 per cent and coronary artery heart disease by 35 per cent.”

Add to that dementia and depression, say both of our sleep experts. And, unfortunately, one in four Canadians has some form of a sleep disorder.

On the brighter side, Wells thinks it’s possible that folks are waking up to the importance of sleep and may even be using this time to develop healthier sleep habits.

“Sleep is definitely a hot topic for everybody and what I saw, especially early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, was a period of disrupted sleep for most people I work with,” says Wells. “However, about six weeks into all of this, we definitely saw a shift where people have gotten used to working from home and started really enjoying not commuting which gives them extra time. A lot of people are now using that extra time to exercise more, spend more time with family and sleep.”

Wells cautions that his sample size is small, so we can’t make too much of his observations. Still, though, it’s nice to know people can make changes—even during a time of crisis.

“I think the key message is that the quality of your sleep is actually under your own control,” Wells says. “We can improve our sleep. It does take time but you can dramatically improve the amount and quality of your sleep and that will have exponential ripple effects on the rest of your life.”",[],907,0.9521169210894146

(Not as safe as a casino, but there are things you can do)",'Christine Sismondo',2020-07-02 00:00:00,"Is it safe to go back in the water?

Over the past few weeks, the City of Toronto has reopened outdoor swimming pools, splash pads and beaches, indicating that it’s safe to wade back into public swimming. Given the recent rise in temperatures, that’s welcome news.

There’s still a little confusion, however, as to whether or not swimming in a public pool is a risky activity. I’ve read that SARS-CoV-2 can’t survive a chlorine bath but, at the same time, there’s a meme circulating on Facebook from CTV News (sourced from MLive.com) that ranks risk levels of various activities. Public pools are right up there at level seven (out of nine) — less risky than churches, buffets and gyms, but more risky than movie theatres and casinos.

Given that every casino I’ve ever been in is a) indoors and b) involves people handling plastic chips, dice or buttons on machines (that other people also touch) oh, say, 50 times an hour, that seems kind of odd. So I decided to ask an infectious disease expert if it was safe to go swimming. Or should I just play it safer and go to Casino Rama instead?

“The risk is really not inherent to being in the pool, in and of itself,” says Dr. Abdu Sharkawy, an infectious disease specialist at the University Health Network of Toronto.

“Because, frankly, there’s not a great deal of evidence that, whether you’re talking about a lake or stream or chlorinated pool, the virus will thrive for any length of time in a concentrated way that could be transmitted from one person to the next.”

Great news for swimmers, right? Unfortunately, this doesn’t mean there’s no risk. Sharkawy went on to explain that the real concern, especially with outdoor pools, is the clusters of young people in close contact. No frolicking in the pool!

“The other thing I think is important to recognize is that people sometimes accidentally ingest pool water or freshwater,” says Sharkawy. “We’ve all had experiences with young kids or people who are not active swimmers who will swallow a big gulp of water, and that can end up in their nose or in their throat, which will make them start coughing around other people.”

There are ways to mitigate these risks, however: most obviously, social distancing. Sharkawy says that the safest way to take a dip would be to go for a swim with the people in your bubble in a relatively quiet lake, like Simcoe, for instance.

That’s not an option for many, though, which is why SwimTO, the City of Toronto program that developed guidelines for the safe reopening of pools and beaches, has been a welcome relief to many. One of the first to avail herself of the amenities was Amy Lavender Harris, an urban geographer who, along with her 11-year-old daughter Katherine, went on the second day that High Park pool was open. Spoiler alert: they had such a good time, they went swimming again a couple of days later at Smythe on Scarlett Road.

“We’ve been to two pools so far,” says Harris. “Both times, there were lineups, but the lineups weren’t that long for the recreational swim. They have restricted capacity for both, but the competition for the lane swim seems to be much more intense because of all the kids who are competitive swimmers and haven’t been in a pool for four months, and are just desperate for lane swim to make up for all of this lost time.”

The leisure swim, on the other hand, was a relatively short wait, says Harris. And well worth it.

“It was so wonderful to be in a pool,” she says. “We took the shutdown very seriously. We stayed at home and we always wear masks when we go into any business; we don’t go out on frivolous errands. But, at this point, after four months, you do start to have to weigh risks like the risk of getting sick versus overall health and your mental well-being. And for us, as parents, we think that, for a child who has been separated from her classmates and dealing with all of her summer camps, art programs and normal swim training being cancelled, getting back into a pool is important for her normal development as a child.”

Harris says she’s “grateful” that SwimTO came online so quickly and says that it feels safe because of the limited capacity, the contact tracing and the sanitizing in between swims (people are admitted in shifts and everyone’s name is taken). It appears to be a good system. There’s little information on the city website as to specific protocols for each pool. In response, some Toronto swim fans have put together Swimming Holes We Have Known, a crowdsourced resource for specific information about each site.

The one improvement Harris suggests is that the city look at extending the hours for the entire summer, the same way they do in a heat wave. The more facilities open for as many hours as possible the better, so we don’t wind up with crowded facilities — like the ones Sharkawy raised concerns about — as we try to balance the competing needs of human contact, exercise and recreation against containing the virus.

“There’s no question that we have to temper caution with a message that is going to be understood to be in the interest of everyone rather than one that is condemning people or shaming them,” says Sharkawy. “People don’t want to be blamed, they want to be given guidance.

“Everybody is responsible for it, whether it’s parents trying to teach their children how to behave when they’re out in public, whether it’s modelling good hand hygiene or whether it’s trying to respect distance,” he continues. “We can all do this successfully if we remain true to our pledge to be socially responsible citizens.”",[],986,0.9445076524405388

Does this have something to do with new measures in place during the pandemic?

This is a common practice at condominiums. The Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO) Certificate of Registration is issued to individuals registered to trade as a salesperson or broker. It has no association with COVID-19 or the current state of emergency in the province.

In Ontario, individuals trading in real estate must be registered with RECO, the provincial regulator of the real estate industry. RECO administers the laws in Ontario’s real estate sector, on behalf of the government and in the public interest. The certificate helps protect consumers by providing a means of identification for registered real estate professionals.

Salespersons and brokers are expected to carry a printed card or use the MyRECO Certificate app that allows them to show their certificate on a mobile device, when requested.

Property management often request to see a certificate before allowing a salesperson and buyers access to view a property. Many residential buildings use the certificate as a security measure to verify that visitors to the unit are who they claim to be.

The Certificate of Registration also means you can rest assured your real estate rep meets the established standards for being registered and the protections that come along with that, including education and insurance.

Every real estate professional in Ontario must complete a specific education before they can become registered to trade in real estate. They must also complete additional courses every two years to keep their knowledge up-to-date.

They are also required to uphold professional standards of conduct and ethics with an emphasis on fairness, honesty and integrity. They must follow rules and regulations under the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act, 2002 that protect Ontario home buyers and sellers.

Registered salespersons and brokers are also held accountable for their actions in real estate transactions. In the instance that something goes wrong, RECO offers a complaint and discipline process designed to protect consumers.

Finally, as a condition of registration, all salespersons and brokers are required to have insurance coverage that protects both consumers and industry professionals, with payments held in trust and insured against loss, insolvency or misappropriation by a brokerage. Errors and Omissions Insurance provides an added layer of protection where damages and legal costs arise from errors, omissions and negligent acts that may occur while trading in real estate.

Another way to confirm a real estate professional’s registration is by visiting www.reco.on.ca and clicking on the Real Estate Professional Search bar.

If you have a question about the home buying or selling process, please email information@reco.on.ca.

Here are three inspiring master bathroom renovations that were dreamed up and completed before the pandemic.

Back to the future: Andrea McQueen was called in to rescue a Burlington, Ont. couple’s master bathroom from a hopeless time warp.

“That bathroom would have been pretty luxe in the ’80s,” said the owner of Andrea McQueen Design, of the dusty-rose-carpeted corner tub, melamine counters, massive wall mirror, shiny black wallpaper and track lighting.

“The couple wanted a functional bathroom that was really beautiful. However, we were conscious about where we invested and where we saved to achieve the look they were after,” said McQueen.

First step: reconfiguring the layout to create a huge, glass-enclosed double shower and provide room for a free-standing tub sourced from Costco.

McQueen cleansed the room of its frenzied patterns and colours, updating it with a soothing white palette. The Carrera marble inside the shower plays off the dove-grey vanity. White porcelain floor tile was a cost-effective choice, and the herringbone pattern elevates the look. Pot lights, sconces and a pretty chandelier cast all kinds of illumination in the room.

“We saved the splurge for plumbing fixtures, cabinetry, lighting, mirrors and a heated floor,” said McQueen.

The big spend was on the double vanity with a mullion detail and big drawers from Top Notch Cabinets in Oakville. “Drawers are super functional storage as opposed to doors,” added McQueen. “Having a place for everything in the bathroom and no clutter really does make your life better,” said McQueen.

A refuge for health-care workers: In pre-pandemic times, interior designer Beth Lowenfeld, principal of Four Blocks South, created a master bathroom oasis for a Forest Hill couple who are both doctors.

“Because they both lead hectic lives and have high-stress jobs and two small kids, the couple wanted to create an area where they could retreat,” said Lowenfeld.

The homeowners were looking for watery hues and sandy tones that remind the wife of her native Newfoundland. “It was exciting to work with more colour than the average Toronto homeowner would choose.”

Enter a deep turquoise shower. “We showed them a much more neutral option and there was no contest. They both immediately gravitated to the turquoise,” said Lowenfeld.

The standard ceramic tiles are set off up by smaller enameled glass tiles from Montreal-based Céragrès with a cascading effect meant to mimic the rippling of water.

The couple loved the streamlined look of the Vanico walnut vanity they happened upon in Roman Bath Centre. “It has lots of storage and sneaky details in the drawers that accommodate everything you can imagine.

“The couple had been living in a small condo for a long time with little kids. And the wife had reached her breaking point with chaos, so being strategic and having a place for everything was huge for her.”

A corner soaker tub is strategically situated under a skylight. “During the day, the way the light reflects on the tiles and reflective surfaces is beautiful.”

Final touches in the the seven-by-11-foot room included a heated towel rack and heated floor.

“Of all the spaces we worked on in the house, this room was one of the most rewarding. The wife said she had a bath the first night they moved in and it was just like heaven,” said Lowenfeld.

A retreat in the trees: Before Laura Stein and her husband could create a new master bedroom and ensuite, they had to serve an eviction notice to a brood of raccoons.

“Yep, there was a full family of raccoons in what would become our bedroom. They even made themselves raccoon-sized doors by cutting through the siding on the outside of the house and pulling it back to gain entry,” said Stein, owner of Laura Stein Interiors.

After a humane goodbye to the former tenants, Stein got to work designing a challenging ensuite bathroom in their 100-year-old Roncesvalles home.

A window on one side of the room, a door on the other and two sloped ceilings in between meant Stein had to experiment with different layouts and ultimately installed a floating wall smack in the middle of the room.

“This became the plumbing wall. On one side is the shower and the other side holds the vanity and sink. And what’s nice about this design is that it separates the shower and sink area so we can both be in there at once and not be in each other’s way.”

Beneath one angled wall is a closet for her husband and beneath the other is a built-in cabinet to store linens and towels.

The floating wall has porcelain tile made to look like marble on the vanity side, and it wraps around to play off the river rock stones on the floor of the shower on the opposite side.

Stein custom-designed the walnut vanity, including the mirror featuring two face-flattering strip lights on either side and cabinetry above it. “It gives us a high-end contemporary feel. And since it’s floating, it lets more light move through the room,” she said.

“I wanted the bathroom to feel like an upscale treehouse. We have a lovely tree on our front lawn. We have a top-down/bottom-up blind that is usually open at the top, so it feels like we’re up in the trees.”",[],905,0.9630405829579947

Sitner’s hometown, Seattle, where he owns a camper-van restoration, repair and rental business called Peace Vans, was the site of one of one of the first huge coronavirus outbreaks. “People were like, ‘Stay away,’” he recalled.

Back home, with peak road-trip season approaching, his employees reported a rush of cancellations on rental vans. Sitner had just hired a “super-awesome” marketing manager and began thinking he might have to lay her off.

School was cancelled, and all but the most essential businesses were ordered to shut down. Sitner was compelled to give his employees a month off, save for a skeletal crew that stuck around to perform essential services like repairs.

“We were looking at some pretty significant revenue black holes,” he said.

Then, in mid-April, the phone started ringing in the repair shop.

“People started thinking they’d have a summer and wanted their classic Volkswagens looked at,” Sitner said.

But it wasn’t just that. There was also a run on a new line of modern camper vans his company had announced with Mercedes-Benz at the Chicago Auto Show in February: produced by a third-party manufacturer called Driverge, sleeping four apiece, and starting at $93,000 without kitchen and cabinetry, $120,000 with.

“We sold like 28 of them in 30 days,” Sitner said. “Some people are saying they’re not getting on a plane for two years or never going to Europe again.”

Sitner is 52, with a 10-year-old daughter named Eden Peach. In person, he projects a tender, Michael Stipe-ish vibe, wistfully remembering that “until recently, we hugged so many of our customers” and brewed espresso in the shop’s front office.

He became acquainted with Peace Vans as a customer, running his Vanagon (a.k.a. the Volkswagen T3) in and out of the shop, in Seattle’s industrial SoDo neighbourhood, between jaunts to Burning Man. In 2013 he learned from the shop owner that he planned to close the business, and Sitner persuaded him to hand it over instead.

Over the years, Sitner has served clientele from aging hippies to Instagramming millennials, and all political persuasions. (In the lot of Peace Vans there was an old VW bus from Iowa awaiting restoration with a National Rifle Association sticker on the driver’s-side window and a painting of the word “Peace” on the side panel.) But the venture with Mercedes, which began casually after he began buying the chassis of the brand’s Metris van from a dealership down the street, has brought a new kind of buyer, Sitner said.

Ed Stevens, a 51-year-old tech entrepreneur in Dallas, had planned to take his wife, Robin, and two adult children scuba diving in the Caribbean when the pandemic took hold. The virus’s spread, he said, was the reason he started looking to buy a camper van.

“We cancelled the reservation and hunkered down, and then I started thinking, ‘I can work from anywhere, Robin’s taking a class online, and we thought we’d just cruise the whole country,” he said. “As soon as I saw the official partnership between Mercedes and Harley, that was the motivating factor.”

(“The idea of building on a Nissan or a Ford light van did not meet the quality bar we wanted,” Sitner said, explaining his choice of chassis.)

Mark and Linda Kimlin had just spent the winter in Spain before returning to New York City in mid-March, feeling “very lucky to escape unscathed,” said Mark Kimlin, 63. But New York was itself about to get scathed, and with the lease up on their Upper East Side apartment, the Kimlins hightailed it to a home they owned in New Paltz, north of the city. (They expect to return to the city when things “settle down,” Linda Kimlin, 65, said.)

Their daughter had planned to get married in California in July (the celebration has been postponed, although not the ceremony) and, Mark Kimlin said, “it seemed like a good time for wide-open spaces and not getting on an airplane.”

His son-in-law-to-be had driven a simpler version of the Metris camper van and shared his positive experience with Kimlin, who bought one from Peace Vans on the strength of that recommendation and the fact that his wife “likes camping, but with a comfy bed.”

Talk to any camper-van owner and they’ll tout the relatively small size of their vehicles compared to traditional RVs and the taller Mercedes Sprinter vans that many Amazon delivery drivers whiz around in, explaining that the more compact Mercedes Metris and VW Vanagons are easily usable as second cars in dense neighbourhoods in major metropolitan areas.

But they’re also great for when a wildfire jumps the highway and bears down on your house — the precise scenario Naomi Neilson stared down in mid-June at her house in Shell Beach, California.

“Everyone was like, ‘Where are you going to go?’ And I was like, ‘I don’t know, I’m going to take my van and go,” said Neilson, 46, who owns a Metris camper van and runs a bathroom-fixture company called Native Trails. “I just threw some food and drinks in the fridge and was ready to go. It took me 10 minutes. I went down the coast a little way and just relaxed. I didn’t end up needing to evacuate for the whole night, but it was nice to be able to just throw a couple things in there and know I had a place to sleep and cook for as long as I needed.”

Of course, this is something owners of Volkswagen Vanagons have taken comfort in for decades.

While Metris owners like Ed Stevens never considered buying such a lovable relic of hippie culture because he “didn’t want to be spending two days somewhere while my transmission gets shipped in from God knows where,” VW owners like Brian Kolonick of Cleveland think the hassle’s worth it because, he said, “my kids think I’m cool for a minute.”

“It’s the way it smells, the way it drives, the way people look at you — you’re bringing them some level of joy,” said Kolonick, 42, who works in digital health for a company called Conversa in Portland, Oregon.

He rented a Vanagon from Sitner before he bought one and said some VW scenesters turn their nose up at him because he “can’t repair things” and has to call a mechanic. He’ll often visit Vanagon forums online, where he occasionally finds diehards dissing the Subaru engines in some custom conversions, arguing that they’re “taking away from the slow-running intensity” of the stock motor.

And it’s fair to surmise that some VW devotees think Metris owners are a tad soft. “We have friends who have them, and I’ve got to admit, we joke about their vans,” said Jim Samuel, 58, a real estate agent and University of Oregon grad in Seattle who named his 1991 Vanagon “Bertha,” after the Grateful Dead song. “But it comes down to people, ultimately.”

Joayne Andrews agrees. A 72-year-old retiree, she lives in Cathedral City, California, just east of Palm Springs, and has owned 26 Volkswagens in her lifetime, four of them vans. A Jetta is her daily ride, but when she really wants to get away, she’s got a 2000 Eurovan at home and an ’82 Westfalia stashed in Seattle that Sitner’s crew has been restoring for the past two years.

When she visits friends up and down the West Coast, she thinks her vans make her a better houseguest. “It’s nice to be able to pull into their driveway and not take up space in their house,” she said. “We’ve got our own little studio apartment.”

As for the Metris campers, her neighbour has one, and Andrews thinks “they’re lovely.”

The Thames Valley Trail follows a meandering 130-kilometre path along the Thames River, one of southern Ontario’s major waterways. The river’s three main branches — known today as the North, Middle and South Thames. The trail follows these branches through diverse habitats in the Carolinian Forest Region, in which a wide range of plant species thrive. In spring, populations of trilliums and other wildflowers explode in the forests, while the pungent smell of early-blooming skunk cabbage permeates the air in swampy wetlands. In open areas, you’ll find everything from meadow herbs to cultivated crops.

The North Branch and South Branch meet at The Forks in the heart of the City of London, and flow through downtown parks. Thanks to these green spaces, urban wildlife, from rabbits and groundhogs to white-tailed deer and coyotes, flourish. The sight of an eastern spiny softshell turtle sunning itself along the muddy banks is a special treat. With its pancake-shaped leathery shell and long, pointed nose, this threatened reptile is extremely distinctive. Much of its habitat has been lost to shoreline development, so Ontario’s softshells are left to depend on sites like the Thames to survive.

There are many spots from which hikers can access the trail along its length. Start at London’s Ivey Park, follow the river northward to Harris Park, and then cross the river at Blackfriars Street. Wander the opposite bank back south to Riverside Park. Kensington Bridge returns you to your starting point.

The St. Williams Conservation Reserve is part of the Norfolk Sand Plain, a delta that formed on the northern shore of Lake Erie after the retreat of the last ice age’s glaciers. Early pioneers eventually settled much of this land, clear-cutting populations of native trees and plants over time and exposing the sandy soil to the elements. The St. Williams Forestry Project was established more than a century ago to grow and plant seedlings in an effort to stabilize what had effectively become desert areas. As one of the first projects in Canada, it serves as a model for subsequent initiatives.

Made up of oak woodland, oak savannah, forest, wet- lands and sand barrens, the St. Williams Conservation Reserve is located on Crown land within the Long Point Biosphere Preserve. With more than 1,000 hectares at two sites, the reserve is a multi-use area that supports a great number of Canadian species at risk. Today, it is being managed to restore and preserve the richly diverse Carolinian habitats and flora and fauna populations that once flourished here.

While exploring the trails, keep your eye open for one of Ontario’s most beautiful and endangered woody plants, the eastern flowering dogwood. This small tree is alive with large blooms in May. Interestingly, the white “petals” on the four-parted flowers are not petals at all but bracts, a leaf-like structure that has taken on the petal’s job of attracting pollinators with their showy colour. The familiar poinsettia and bougainvillea plants share the same characteristic.

Another St. Williams denizen to watch for is the eastern hog-nosed snake. When attacked, it hisses, makes a striking motion, flattens its neck and even plays dead. It’s a harmless display intended to discourage potential predators. Unfortunately, in recent years, this snake has moved from threatening to threatened as its population has declined; a research project at St. Williams is focused on how to preserve this intriguing Ontario species.",[],576,0.9333882336461244

But like you, we dream of travelling again, and are publishing these stories with future trips in mind.

KILLARNEY MOUNTAIN LODGE — Moose and black bears occasionally wander the grounds of this historic resort on Georgian Bay’s rugged north shore.

But nobody gets concerned until a beaver waddles ashore, because Killarney Mountain Lodge is now home to the world’s largest log-built conference centre.

It looks delicious to beavers and magnificent to humans.

The 2,500 trees London lawyer Holden Rhodes planted at the 72-year-old resort he bought five years ago have been wrapped with plastic tubes to keep beavers at bay. But it was the 500 people busily building Canada House last year that kept the beavers from chewing on the pine logs from Ontario and Douglas fir trees from British Columbia that eventually became this palace of timber.

Now that the 34,000-square-foot conference centre is up and open, Rhodes and his wife, Carey, are hoping a steady flow of vacationers, wedding parties, convention delegates and those looking for fine dining will scare beavers away from the impressive Canada House.

Rhodes named his conference centre Canada House because it displays the primary features of Canada: rocks, trees, water galore, big space and fabulous views.

It’s one of Ontario’s finest meeting places, but it has no subway connection. It’s 430 kilometres north of Toronto and 110 kilometres southwest of Sudbury, but it does sit on Canada’s 400-year-old principal canoe route.

Little has changed in the village of Killarney since executives of Detroit’s Fruehauf Trailer Company arrived here in the late 1940s to build a remote hideaway so its senior executives, best customers and principal suppliers could escape from the pressures of big business in the city.

You could only reach the village by boat or float plane and it offered some of the finest fishing, hunting, hiking and sunsets on the continent. Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa used to come to this wilderness to negotiate labour deals in comfort with Fruehauf execs between poker games. There are rumours that he is still here.

At age 38, Maury East and his wife, Annabelle, bought the private retreat in 1962 and swung open its thick wooden doors to the travelling public. That’s when Ontario decided to connect Killarney to the rest of the world and built a 65-kilometre paved highway through the woods to connect with Highway 69, the principal highway between Southern Ontario and Sudbury.

The East family operated the 14-hectare Killarney Mountain Lodge for 53 years, selling it to Rhodes five years ago.

After graduating from a British law school and postgraduate law studies at Western, Rhodes became a partner in London’s McKenzie Lake law firm, practising corporate law.

In his spare time, he launched a small agency that traced the ownership and maintenance history of used cars across Canada. His part-time firm, Carproof, grew substantially until he sold it to the owners of Carfax in the U.S. for $650 million.

Rhodes has poured $42 million into KML, upgrading the various cabins, cottages and motel suites that can accommodate 301 visitors, plus another 94 at neighbouring Sportman’s Inn, also owned by Rhodes.

About 25 per cent of Killarney’s 500 residents are employed at the resort. The village and resort sit on the Killarney channel, a body of calm waters protected from the waves of Georgian Bay by uninhabited George Island.

More than 725 boats, averaging 12 metres in length, but some at nearly 34 metres, were moored at KML’s marina last season, 60 per cent of them visiting from the U.S. Most days, there are usually two or three float planes at the marina as well.

Last year, the channel was full of float planes when a bush plane pilots group held its annual general meeting in Canada House.

Thousands of canoes also arrive at Killarney each summer. Close by is the historic French River — Ontario’s first major highway — which was the principal route 400 years ago for Coureur des bois, wilderness explorers and Indigenous travellers moving from Montreal to Georgian Bay.

The French River is the first declared heritage river in Canada and is still a popular canoe route.

The nearly 162,000-hectare Killarney Provincial Park sits next door to the village. The wilderness park has 183 campsites on 50 separate lakes, 80 kilometres of marked hiking trails, 11 different canoe routes, is open year-round and last year was Ontario’s first provincial park to be designated a Dark Sky Preserve. There are fewer than 100 such preserves in the world and 19 are in Canada.

Rhodes plans to make KML nearly as popular in winter as it is in summer with snowmobile rentals, cross-country skiing, ice fishing, star gazing into a clear, dark sky and outdoor campfires.

If you prefer indoor campfires, Canada House has two of the largest stone fireplaces built in Ontario.

More than 15,000 hours of masonry work went into building the two fireplaces, plus all the stone flooring and walls used throughout Canada House. Some of the stone comes from a quarry in Wiarton on the Bruce Peninsula, plus pink granite from Manitoulin Island. And there is plenty of exposed pink granite protruding through the grass on the lodge’s 14-hectare campus.

Rhodes is no stranger to Killarney and the vicinity. His mother and his grandmother were both born in the village and he spent many summers in his youth exploring the area woods, the waters and the village.

His grandmother worked at the lodge for East. His family goes back practically to when Killarney was founded as a fur trading post in 1820.

For many years, the village was known as Shebahonaning, Ojibwa for “safe passage.” The village and the lodge had proposed a joint celebration of the community’s 200th anniversary on July 1, but Rhodes said the celebration has been postponed to 2021.

Canada House displays paintings by Indigenous painters on all its walls, many from the Wiikwemkoong First Nation on Manitoulin Island.

Two dozen ceremonial dancers from Wiikwemkoong participated in the official opening of Canada House last June.

Soon, Rhodes will lift a 12-ton wooden canoe paddle on to the exterior of Canada House and plans to make Killarney the paddle capital of Canada. The paddle will be a time capsule to be opened in 200 years. It’s being crafted by local resident Mike Ranta, who twice has paddled his canoe coast-to-coast across Canada.",[],1062,0.9436236932700564

And when you add the young men who would be their escorts and backup escorts, that number more than doubles. All the work was intended to lead to The Links Inc. Chicago chapter’s 60th annual Debutante Cotillion, a formal ball where the debutantes are presented to society with the support of their escorts, family and friends. But just like proms, graduations and other milestones for young people, COVID-19 squashed this event.

“The original cotillion date was April 25, but then we changed it to June 13, and then we changed it to the first weekend in August, and then we said this isn’t going to be accomplishable,” said 2020 Cotillion chair and The Links member Dr. Joy West. Originally scheduled to be held at the Fairmont Chicago under the theme of “Diamonds and Pearls,” the cotillion is now planned for May 1, 2021. “This was devastating for us, basically because of the families. The senior families in particular.”

According to West, when the idea for a virtual cotillion was presented, families turned it down.

“Families wanted the full experience, and they didn’t think the virtual experience could capture the beauty and grace of the moment for their debutantes, so they opted to wait,” West said.

The move didn’t sit well with Havilland Williams, a rising senior at the Chicago High School for the Arts. When she mentioned to friends that she was preparing for the cotillion, she said, many of her peers weren’t familiar with the concept of the ball. She likens it to a quinceanera, but it’s not a birthday party.

Cotillion is a rite of passage for young women in the Black community. It’s a tradition that has been going on for 60 years in Chicago under the guidance of the Chicago chapter of The Links Inc., the national women’s service organization based on friendship and community service. Founded in 1950, the Chicago chapter places a special emphasis on volunteering in the fields of youth services, international trends, health services and promoting African American art.

“To find out school was cancelled and the cotillion was cancelled? I was really upset,” Williams said. “But what can you do?”

Her escort, Lorenz King, who will be attending Morehouse College in the fall, calls the recent spate of cancellations and postponements unfair. As a St. Rita of Cascia High School senior, he trained for the ball alongside Williams but won’t be coming back to escort her. Instead his younger brother will go.

“We’ll never get this again in our lives. I’ll never get to graduate high school, I’ll never get prom, and we work so hard. It’s just the feeling of accomplishment, after everything you’ve done, and you’re just not going to get it,” King said. “It gets frustrating sometimes. ... It’s kind of sad that we didn’t get a payoff of everything we did.”

West said that all of the debutantes have the opportunity to walk in 2021, and while all the juniors will do so, only about four or five seniors will return from college to participate. It’s a huge miss for participants, after the community service, fundraising, classes and workshops. And let’s not forget finding the proper ball gown, which has to be floor-length and white, accompanied by white gloves.

Participants raise money by selling ads to small businesses, and the cotillion class chooses a community organization to receive the money raised. The Chicago chapter of The Links focuses on mental health and wellness, West said.

“Our national mission is to transform communities through service, and we feel like continuing the legacy of cotillion by providing an opportunity for our young people to witness resilience through times of unrest, is important,” West said. “What we wanted our current families and community to see is a dedication to continuing to transform communities through service. Even though our goal to give $60,000 (U.S.) back to the community for our 60th did not happen, we have recommitted to doing just that for 2021.”

According to LaTisha Williams, Havilland’s mother, the cost to the family of making the cotillion happen runs in the thousands of dollars, and that includes selling $150 tickets to relatives and friends for seats at tables during the event. But Williams said it’s worth it for her only daughter to have this opportunity for education, mentorship and camaraderie. Havilland Williams and King said they not only learned etiquette, but have taken part in financial workshops about stocks and bonds as well as ones centred on mental health.

Havilland Williams considers cotillion to be on a higher level than prom.

“It has more elegance and grace in it and kind of like ballet — makes me feel poised and pretty, and I like how that makes me feel,” she said. “With prom, it’s just everyone is there, everyone wants to look better than you, but in cotillion, it’s more about unity.”

“In the end, you just see the dancing, but there’s a lot that goes into it,” King said. “A lot you can take away from it — years down the line, and that’s why I think it’s better than a homecoming or a prom.”

Camille Lonzer, a 2019 debutante from South Shore, says the event was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that she’ll remember forever.

“It’s just a rush of happiness seeing everyone in their dress. ... I would compare it to a graduation or a prom because you get to show off and show out. It’s definitely exciting,” she said. “I wasn’t too much of a social person beforehand, and it sort of opened my eyes to a lot of different people who have a lot of different opinions and perspectives. But also the community service aspect of the cotillion, it was life changing for me. I think that’s a nice aspect of it because you really feel like the community needs you as a person.”

“2021 will still be our 60th anniversary, although I don’t know what the flavour of that will look like,” West said. “But what we do know is that the journey to cotillion — the rehearsals and workshops — will be a fun and informative time for the debutantes and escorts. We want to make this next year just as interesting as this past year was.”",[],1082,0.9322898740089665

“I like to believe that he did hear me,” she said in an interview this week.

“I said something to him before he passed, which made him know that it was OK to leave us, and I had never said those words before, so shortly thereafter he did pass. I do believe he could hear.”

Ian Jordan suffered a head injury when he and another officer were on their way to a call in Victoria in September 1987. He died in April 2018.

Now, research from the University of British Columbia suggests people who are unresponsive can hear, even hours before they die.

Lead author Elizabeth Blundon, who recently graduated from the university with a PhD in psychology, said the findings may bear out a persistent belief among health-care workers that hearing is the last sense to go in the dying process.

The study, published recently in Scientific Reports, was the first to investigate hearing when people are close to death, in one case six hours beforehand, Blundon said.

The research involved eight patients at a hospice doing a hearing task when they were still responsive. Five of them repeated the task when they became unconscious.

A control group of 17 young, healthy participants also took part in the study, which was completed between 2013 and 2017.

Participants wore a cap with 64 electrodes that measured brain waves as they listened to a series of tones grouped in five patterns that would occasionally change.

Those in the control group pressed a button when they heard the pattern change while the responsive patients at the hospice were asked to count the number of times the pattern changed.

The brain activity of the control group and the responsive hospice patients was very similar to that of the unresponsive patients, Blundon said.

“It’s an encouraging sign that at the very least the brain is reacting and processing at some capacity the auditory information that it’s receiving,” she said of the glimpse into brain activity that persists in the transition between life and death.

“But I can’t tell anybody if their loved one understands them or knows who’s talking to them,” Blundon said, adding further research is needed to delve deeper into the mysteries of end-of-life hearing.

Previous research into hearing of unresponsive patients has been done in Europe on patients with traumatic brain injury and showed they also respond to sound, said Blundon, who hopes to continue her work at the University of Miami, where she may also look into the effects of music on those near death.

Dr. Romayne Gallagher, who recently retired as a palliative care physician at St. John Hospice, where part of the study was completed, said she noticed during 30 years in her job that patients would react positively when they heard the voice of a loved one, even on the phone.

Families can take some measure of comfort from spending time talking to their loved ones, even when they don’t respond, she added.

“A lot of people are scared of this time and they don’t quite know what to do, and we often say to them, ‘Talk to them, play their favourite music.’ Things like that.”

Jordan said she spent thousands of hours “chit-chatting” with her husband and playing his favourite music from the 1970s and ’80s on a boom box she brought to hospital.

“It just seemed natural, speaking to him,” she said, adding that he seemed to respond most favourably every time she mentioned their son Mark, who was 16 months old when the crash happened.",[],635,0.9446351445708934

She says, “I moved in with my parents during the pandemic, but I’ll be moving back to the west end when things clear up.” She says, “I wear a lot of decently stylish thrifted clothes. If I can look down and see that everything I’m wearing is second-hand, I’m proud of my outfit.” (Gemma says that her friend describes her style as “someone who got their clothes wet at school and had to go through the lost and found.”) Gemma is “a bit dorky, but in a good way. I’m energetic and enthusiastic. I love to have fun and I’m a good listener. I’m that person who is friends with everyone.”

I met Antonio through Instagram. He’s a friend of a friend. I liked his artistic style. The photos he posts capture things really beautifully. We started messaging and always had fun banter, and I got really curious about him. I suggested a phone call, but he wasn’t interested. He kept messaging me, though. I could tell he was very thoughtful, and thinks deeply and critically about things.

I asked Antonio out casually a few times, mentioning I’d be around his neighbourhood and we could grab coffee if he was interested. He always seemed pretty enthusiastic but then always ended up being busy. Once he agreed to a date but then blew me off a few times, and then finally cancelled due to an “emergency,” but didn’t say what that was. He was so inconsistent. He seemed interested in me, complimented me, then failed to initiate or respond. I don’t know why I was still even a little bit into him. It was an infuriating cycle.

I claimed I was completely done with him. But Antonio kept messaging me. The next week I saw him post about a show he was going to be at that night and, in a moment of pure spontaneity, I just kind of inserted myself into his evening. I said I’d see him there and we could finally meet. He said that would be cool. I made it seem like I was planning to go to the show anyway and not that I was 100 per cent going out of my way to see him!

He definitely seemed happy when I arrived. We hugged hello. It was hard to gauge how I was feeling when I actually met him. I was still right there in the adrenalin and rush of the last-minute decision. It was really weird putting together my perceptions of him from Instagram and my perceptions of him in the moment. I was trying to figure out if I was attracted to him. To be honest, Antonio kind of reminded me of these really cool guys I went to high school with, the people that everyone loves who are also kind of obnoxious.

I was definitely nervous. He thanked me for showing up and told me he was surprised that I made it out. I was surprised, too! We couldn’t think of what exactly to say to each other then. It was loud; the setting wasn’t totally conducive to life-story sharing. When I described my job to him, he didn’t seem totally engaged. The mood was still lighthearted, though. He seemed very in his element. We danced and joked around and I started having a good time. The music was amazing. I had that warm and whimsical feeling that you get when strangers join together and share one experience. For a while I felt like I was in a movie.

We eventually moved outside where we could actually hear each other talk. At one point he told me we should “totally do this again” as if I hadn’t already suggested on at least three separate occasions that we meet up for a date!

I left after last call. We hugged goodbye. When I got home he had messaged me saying that it was great to finally meet each other and thanked me again for coming.

We message occasionally on Instagram, but it leads nowhere. That’s just what “dating” looks like for me right now. I’m still trying to grasp his interest level. Not knowing probably drives my curiosity even more. Maybe I’ll bump into him when we start going to bars again, but planning anything? That’s too much to ask.

The way we shop has changed—socially distanced line-ups, one-way aisles, plexiglass cashier shields—but the vital relationship between supermarkets and their customers endures.

In this spirit, Sobeys Inc. launched the Community Action Fund, an initiative aimed at giving back to local communities by committing millions of dollars in donations to organizations helping those in need during these difficult times. The program is focused on creating localized solutions, empowering the company’s some 1,500-strong grocery and drugstore banners—including Safeway, Foodland, FreshCo, IGA and Lawtons—to decide how to best to support their neighbourhoods.

“Nobody has a better idea of what their local communities need now than our frontline store teams across the country,” says Michael Medline, president and CEO of Empire Company Ltd, owner of Sobeys. “It’s inspiring to see how quickly they banded together to give back to people in need.”

For store managers like Don McWilliam of Foodland in Stratford, Ont., the program presented an opportunity to lift up a fellow small business. Upon learning that local spirit-maker Junction 56 Distillery was pivoting its production to create much-needed hand sanitizer—donating much of it to high-risk essential services like shelters, and selling the rest to the public at cost—McWilliam and his team knew they’d found a worthy endeavour. Their contribution—pre-purchasing $1,000 worth of product to be distributed for free—helped two-fold: sanitizer would reach the hands of Canadians faster while helping to alleviate the economic stress faced by the craft distillery after generously transitioning its business.

Standing behind his community feels natural for McWilliam, crisis or not. “I’ve always looked out for the underdog,” he says. Growing up, he remembers that grocery stores were always giving back, a tradition he’s keen to preserve.

Another casualty of the COVID-19 crisis has been food security amongst our most vulnerable populations. Sobeys Inc. and its dedicated partners have stepped up to the plate. Across Ontario, the company has donated $300,000 to resource-strapped food banks like the Daily Bread Food Bank, Second Harvest and regional organizations in North York, Mississauga, Kitchener-Waterloo, Thunder Bay and Ottawa. The company’s contributions—financial support plus donated gift cards, thousands of prepackaged hampers and cases of pantry essentials—helps those who need it most.

Through the Community Action Fund, Myles Power, store manager at FreshCo University & Bridge in Waterloo, Ont. was able to present $1,500 worth of $50 gift cards to his local chapter of Food4Kids. Since 2016, the non-profit organization has been dedicated to serving snacks and meals to children through school programs. But in light of school closures, Food4Kids was struggling to get food on the plates of kids who needed it.

As a grandfather of nine and a two-decade-long owner of the FreshCo store, where he’s employed generations of family members, Power couldn’t fathom the thought of any child in his community going hungry. “This one is close to my heart,” he says.

The concept of family, and of making a difference in the lives of others, has been a throughline within Sobeys Inc. since its inception in Nova Scotia over 100 years ago.

Even as the increased risks and mitigating precautionary measures descended on the stores, this “family first” attitude helped to unite the staff at the Sobeys Queensway location in Etobicoke, Ont. “Everyone looks after each other and helps out, chips in when needed,” says store manager Shawn Bergman. “If someone’s down, we’re there to pick them up.”

When it came time to decide how they’d allocate their share of the Community Action Fund, the Sobeys Queensway staff turned their efforts to nearby St. Joseph’s Health Centre, which recently reported a COVID-19 outbreak. Bergman and his team donated $2,000 worth of Sobeys gift cards to hardworking hospital staff, giving them a chance to pick up lunch or stock their fridge without worry after a long shift.

“As much as we’re frontline workers working in grocery stores, the true frontline workers are the ones working in hospitals and the healthcare system,” says Bergman. “With the hours that they’re putting in and all their dedication, we just wanted to show that we care and appreciate what they do.”",[],685,0.9312041819169534

Its owners, the Moreno family, reserved Tuesdays as a day off from making mouth-watering tacos de carnitas and traditional mole. But that changed in the wake of COVID-19: They decided to open their doors to feed the community for free.

The Moreno family immigrated to Toronto from Mexico City in 2007 and opened Itacate in 2016 to cook the kind of soulful food they had grown up on. Now, outside the door of the little counter-serve spot on a strip of St. Clair West dotted with family businesses, a simple sign invites anyone in need—frontline workers, those who have lost their jobs, homeless people—to pick up a hot meal at no charge. Last week, they prepared 150 portions of chicken fajitas, each served with a steaming side of rice and beans.

“My mom decided we were going to start making free meals for people who need it because, well, she's like that: She feels good when she’s taking care of people,” explains Jahaziel Moreno, who runs the restaurant along with her parents and sisters. “We don't ask for identification to prove you’re a frontline worker or anything. We just let people know that there is good food here for those who need it.”

The restaurant has faced its own financial pressure: Plans to open a second storefront have been shelved after sales drastically slowed because of COVID-19 restrictions (they used to do a solid late-night shift, for example, serving hearty tortas to the party crowd). “My mother had some savings, so we are using that at the moment,” says Moreno simply. “She has a saying in Spanish, which is basically: If you give to people, then one day God will give it back to you.”

Francisco Rico-Martinez, co-director of the FCJ Refugee Centre on Oakwood Avenue, just around the corner from Itacate, wasn’t surprised to see the Moreno family in masks, serving take-out meals to neighbours free of charge. “They’ve passed through very difficult times since arriving in Canada, and they have been resilient,” he says. “I helped them with the process of becoming permanent residents, and when that happened last winter, they invited more than 100 people from the neighbourhood to a party. It was a way to say thank you to the community for helping them to stay in Canada.”

Kerri Romeo, who says she could live off of Itacate’s “incredible” chilaquiles for days, has lived in the St. Clair West and Oakwood area for four years and sees its community spirit thriving despite recent hardships. “It’s great to see everyone keeping this neighbourhood alive,” she says. “This stretch of St. Clair West is in transition—there are a lot of empty storefronts—but newer businesses like Primrose Bagel Co. have offered free coffee and bagels, and little free pantries have popped up across the neighbourhood for those who might need it.”

Rico-Martinez, who brought the FCJ Refugee Centre to St. Clair West 16 years ago, feels the same way. “This remains a neighbourhood of family businesses,” he says. “I’ve been amazed at the donations from the community. Every day, we receive groceries on our porch, we receive packages of art supplies for children. The Moreno family is a huge part of the sense of belonging that exists in this community.”

Itacate has long been a taste of home for Josue Hernandez, who immigrated to Canada from Mexico a decade ago and stops several times a month get his fix of authentic tacos and crisp, weighty pambazo sandwiches. “My relationship with the family is bigger than the restaurant now: I have a friendship with them,” he says. “Every time I go, I joke about soccer with Jahaziel’s father, because our favourite teams are rivals. It’s the kind of place where you feel like you know everyone—but they literally know everyone. They are so close with each other, and they treat everyone like a part of their family.”

Before social distancing stopped the Morenos from seating customers at their two small tables, they relished offering sit-down hospitality—they wanted every guest to feel welcome. “Do you know what Itacate means?” asks Rico-Martinez. “It’s the word people in Mexico use for the big bag of food your mom might prepare for you to take home after a visit. That gives you an understanding of the type of restaurant they wanted to create.”

The Morenos’ dedication has not gone unnoticed; neighbours pop their heads in often to offer thanks and encouragement to the family as they prep meals. “A customer left us a card that read: ‘Not all heroes wear capes or scrubs—some wear aprons.’ My mom cried,” says Moreno. She stops to think for a moment. “My mother cooks with love and people can feel that.”",[],797,0.9185560266473354

Social media is filled with people proudly showcasing their fresh loaves and arranging sourdough starter swaps. As pandemic baking rises in popularity, Ontario’s independent mills are grinding around the clock to meet the demand.

Matt Faust, the general manager of mill and bakery Brodflour in Liberty Vilage, says that prior to the pandemic, the business’s main source of income was the café. Flour sales were about $1,500 per month. Once COVID-19 hit, however, flour sales jumped to $15,000 in April alone. Now, Brodflour baristas are lifting a lot more than lattes.

“In the past, we’ve been making sandwiches and toast and coffee, and now those people are helping us get large flour orders out the door, helping package up wholesale orders, managing wholesale customers,” says Faust. “I wouldn’t say we’re frontline workers, but I like to think that we offer an essential service.”

Brodflour over-bakes every day, providing loaves to local community and respite centres and food security programs. Contactless pick-up is available for customers, but Brodflour is on UberEats as well, allowing baking-mad citizens to place an order from the comfort of their couch.

About 100 kilometres west of Toronto, in Fergus, 1847 Stone Milling has been overwhelmed with flour-delivery demand. The mill has seen a 3,000 per cent increase in flour sales, much of it going to Toronto (and some being donated to a local bakery making bread for health care workers). The surge has required multiple sets of grandparents to pitch in and help fulfill orders. Everyone is working seven days a week. The mill used to have farm-gate pick-up, but now it’s delivery-only, with a stream of FedEx, UPS, and Canpar drivers rolling through every day to pick up dozens of sacks.

“It’s too bad that people have to pay for shipping, but I think it’s better in the long run so that they have the flour delivered right to them,” McKeown says. “Plus, it’s bulky and heavy and it’s nice to have it arrive at your door.” The mill recently received a telephone call from the area’s MPP, Ted Arnett, thanking them for continuing to serve the community during these strange times.

K2 Milling in Beeton, Ont. also has a growing stable of admirers. Mark Hayhoe—who also goes by the moniker “Kaptain Flour”—is descended from a long line of flour millers and has been milling flour in Beeton for almost three decades. But he says he’s never seen anything like this. Home flour sales are up 500 per cent since the pandemic started. K2 developed their own way to mill flour that “focuses on flavour, not colour,” and take pride in the “accessibility, transparency, and traceability” independent mills can offer customers, but maintaining an adequate supply of grains has been tricky these days. So has “seeing and hearing the fear and worry from our new customers and trying to remain calm, re-assuring and alert,” Hayhoe says. “But people have been uncannily kind, gracious and truly appreciative towards our daily grind. I hope our little artisanal flourmill in Simcoe County has encouraged people to understand the resiliency of the artisanal food system in comparison to the industrial food one. It did bend, but it did not break.”

It has, in fact, flourished. The pandemic has even inspired new flour businesses. Flour-delivery service West End Flour started up at the end of March via Instagram, ferrying 20-kilogram bags of K2 Milling’s Viking, Bianca, Ferdinand, and Red Tail varieties to west end denizens, all the way from Beeton. Why are people so wild for baking right now? “Comfort,” Hayhoe says. “Bread is a historically important basic food. It has been given a bit of a rough ride the past decade, and it takes times like this to realize how vital the staff of life is to humanity.”

And, so, the millers persevere, ensuring that the breadboxes of Toronto remain blessedly full. “We’re really thankful that we can keep working and that we’re able to provide our community with something that they really need right now,” McKeown says. “It’s not just the flour: it’s that sense of normalcy and making them happy. When you’re baking, you’re happy.”",[],696,0.9363537016332394

But, over the course of the past month, he and his colleagues at Progress Place—a community organization specializing in mental health support—have had to go pro. Wyatt is the mental health unit supervisor at Progress Place, which, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, has taken its support services virtual. Progress Place has extended the hours of their peer support chat service, the Warm Line. There are at least three virtual support activities per day, ranging from yoga to seminars on how to keep busy at home. “I’m also regularly taking phone calls from members to chat, and provide wellness checks, and support and case management as needed,” says Wyatt.

Clients are reveling in this new form of community. “It obviously doesn’t replace the face-to-face connections, but it’s so important to see people that you know, and for someone to be excited when they see your face pop up on a screen.”

Wyatt and his fellow staffers also brave the outside world daily to deliver free meals to members who live nearby, providing wellness checks. “Food security is incredibly important for our community,” Wyatt says. “For people who are low-income, it’s a huge challenge to access healthy food. This helps provide people with a sense of hope that we’re all going to get through this together.” Recently, Wyatt says, a community partner client cried when he got his food because he was so relieved to know that he didn’t have to brave the grocery stores.

The wellness checks are essential too. When a recent check revealed that a woman had become psychotic, she was taken to the hospital to receive mental health services. Another wellness check on a woman showed that she was consumed with fever. At the hospital, she tested positive for COVID-19. She’s now back at home, quarantined, receiving regular telephone support from staff. Both checks occurred in the past 10 days.

“For years, our goal has always been outreach and preventing people from isolating at home because it can make people more symptomatic and lead to hospitalizations,” says Wyatt. “Now we’re at a point where people don’t really have a choice—they’re being told to distance and isolate. It’s critical to remember that, for a lot of people in our program, a sense of community has been taken away from them because of their illness, whether it’s because of a schizophrenia diagnosis that has left them without a job, friends or sometimes even family, or whether it’s from an anxiety or depression diagnosis that stems from bullying. So being able to facilitate virtual activities or hand out meals to our members has ensured they continue to have that same sense of community that a lot of us take for granted.”",[],467,0.9361561669379737

Operating room nurse Andrea MacDonald is one such person. When the COVID-19 pandemic descended on the city, the 34-year-old, who has devoted the majority of her 10-year nursing career to the Thoracic Surgery and Lung Transplant team at Toronto General Hospital (TGH), answered the call to step up without hesitation.

In early April, MacDonald decided to volunteer for TGH’s newly formed Early Response Intubation Team (ERIT), a four-person group dedicated solely to intubating COVID patients. Since the virus aggressively impacts the respiratory system, this procedure, which assists in mechanical breathing, can literally be the difference between life and death. But it’s an incredibly taxing process that takes about two hours and involves inserting a plastic endotracheal tube almost a foot into the windpipe. And it’s dangerous for medical staff, given the direct exposure to a COVID-positive patient’s airways.

The sacrifices would be significant for MacDonald. Becoming a member of ERIT meant trading in her established Monday-to-Friday work week for an intense schedule of 12-hour shifts: two days followed by two overnights. It also meant entering the very centre of the pandemic response, something that wasn’t required of her. But MacDonald was all in. “There was no question whether or not I would join it,” she says.

MacDonald’s colleague Nicole Maia, a registered nurse, says it’s no surprise that she was one of the first to put her name forward for the job. “She is always going above and beyond for the team and for her patients,” Maia says. She notes MacDonald’s unflappable attitude when faced with high-risk situations—“calm, focused and highly collaborative”—but besides her strong clinical skills, Maia says it’s her compassion that makes MacDonald uniquely suited to these difficult moments. After all, this is an extremely frightening and lonely experience for a patient. “Andrea is an incredibly empathetic and humble nurse,” Maia says. “It’s her reassuring approach that brings security to her patients, especially when they are at their most vulnerable.”

Still, MacDonald was nervous when she first joined ERIT. “I went in on that Monday with a lot of uncertainty,” she says. “How many codes would there be a day? How long is this going to go on for? Am I going to get sick? Are we going to have enough resources?” But once the increased personal protection policies and procedures were in place and the team got down to work, those fears quickly dissolved. As of April 17, MacDonald had performed several emergency intubation procedures. The team is prepared to do up to 10 a day, but she hopes that, as the curve flattens with time, it won’t come to that.

While MacDonald admits that her work life is infused with a new unease, being on the frontlines actually eases her worries about the pandemic. “I felt like it helped with my anxiety about the unknown,” she says. “If I was to offer help in any way that I could, it would make me feel more hopeful about the outcome.”

Once a vaccine becomes available, when social distancing measures wane and the “new normal” becomes, well, normal, MacDonald thinks we’ll look back on this time as one of unity. We’re arguably more isolated from each other than the human race has ever been, but she sees evidence of solidarity everywhere. She points to the way her new team came together, got prepared and practised intubation simulations in less than a week (“I’ve been extremely impressed with everyone’s willingness to jump in and help”); and the daily 7 p.m. salutes to frontline workers, though MacDonald is quick to share that recognition. “I like to think of it more as we’re all doing our part in one way or another,” she says. “For the people banging the pots and pans, it’s simply staying at home—and that’s just as important as what I’m doing every day at work.”

Like the rest of us, MacDonald is buoyed through the day-to-day by self-care rituals like home workouts, takeout dinners and video calls with friends and family checking in on her. Also keeping her motivated are the ubiquitous “We’re all in this together” posters by Toronto-based artist Dreeem, taped up in temporarily vacant shopfronts across the city. “Every morning on my way to work, I walk down into the subway and I see that poster. I say it a couple of times in my head, ‘We’re all in this together.’ And I really do believe it,” MacDonald says, the emotion evident in her voice. When it’s all over, she says, “I think I’ll remember seeing that poster every day.”",[],762,0.9642920412278386

In 2019, St. Stephen’s Community House lost provincial funding for its overdose prevention services program. Then the pandemic happened. For drug users and people in life-threatening withdrawal, support services like ERs, detox beds, shelters, drop-ins, and doctors and psychiatrists have become hard to access, according to Tyler Watts, a coordinator of overdose prevention services at St. Stephen’s. Many services have also gone phone- or web-based, which is a barrier for people that are on a fixed income or homeless.

Social isolating is also often impossible for St. Stephen’s clients—and dangerous. Watts usually urges clients to never use drugs alone. “But how do you maintain that in a society that is now told to isolate?” he asks. “Plus, they’re being criminalized for being on the streets and not isolating because there is nowhere to go. They struggle to find a drug supply that isn’t toxic and deadly and it is increasingly hard to find spaces they can use and feel safe.”

Now, every morning, a larger-than-normal line of clients snakes around the building. Only two people are allowed in at a time. If someone overdoses, employees must get into full PPE before helping. “It can be quite distressing when you’re looking at someone turning blue and you’re trying to squeeze goggles onto your face before jumping in to save them,” says Watts.

Recently, Watts says, a woman arrived at the site in tears because she had been wandering around all night, looking for somewhere to use the washroom. “She told me she’d never felt so stripped of her dignity,” Watts remembers. “It makes me so sad that people can’t even get their most basic needs met.” Still, Watts soldiers on. “The reason I come to work now is the same as it’s always been: to save lives. The pandemic hasn’t changed that—only made it that much more important.”

Meet Kylie Beatty and Theresa Hirschberg, Sistering

On any given day, more than 9,000 Toronto citizens experience homelessness. Many of them are even further marginalized. “There weren’t—and still aren’t—many specialized services that focus on women, and trans and non-binary folks,” says Theresa Hirschberg, a team coordinator at Sistering, the multi-service agency’s Parkdale Pandemic Response Site. “Sistering provides a collaborative space to advocate for the most vulnerable folks in the city.”

Before the pandemic, an average day for Hirschberg involved building relationships with clients, crisis intervention and referring people out to collaborative agencies. While the pandemic rages on, their clients still need help. “Closing the drop-in and shifting to a respite program was that ‘whoa’ moment,” says Kylie Beatty, who is also a team coordinator at Sistering’s response site. “It was clear that access to services had changed significantly, and the way we were connecting would have to change.”

So what does an average day look like now? “No two days are alike,” Beatty says. “But we’re still checking in with folks and making sure we’re all supporting each other and staying safe.” Each day, the team coordinators read up on the ever-changing interaction guidelines, and they’re outfitted in personal protective equipment (PPE). They also must screen every client for potential COVID-19 exposure, along with adhering to the distancing requirements. “We had to redefine our service model but still keep that level of participant focus and care,” says Hirschberg. “The pandemic has highlighted the willingness and capacity to come together as a community. [Clients] reassure each other and show generosity to each other—and seeing the community that they have developed in the space has been heartwarming.”",[],581,0.9644843454266494

Lachlan MacLean believes his company can help provide a solution.

“MHCs, also known as land lease communities, are the ‘missing middle’ in the housing market,” says MacLean, Vice-President Property Operations for Parkbridge Lifestyle Communities. “It’s increasingly hard for Canadians to make the jump from renting to ownership. Our model of home ownership can provide a middle step.”

Land lease is a well-established ownership model, points out MacLean, but it isn’t well-known in Canada. It allows you to purchase a home without buying the land on which it sits. The land itself is owned and maintained by the owner-operator – and the result is significant savings for buyers looking to break into the housing market.

In Edmonton, for example, you’d pay $380,000 for the average freehold home, compared to approximately $100,000 to buy a home in one of Parkbridge’s communities, located within the city. Let’s assume you put a 10 per cent down payment on a MHC home and take on a high-ratio mortgage for the remainder (manufactured homes are eligible for CMHC mortgage insurance). You would pay approximately $500 per month for your mortgage and $680 for monthly site rental on the lot where the home is situated. The grand total: about $1,200 in monthly costs.

In contrast, the carrying cost of a mortgage on a single-family freehold home of a similar size in Edmonton would be about $1,900 per month. Although you could buy a condo for less (about $225,000), you would still pay about $1,600 per month: $500 condo fee +$1100 mortgage. And renting a condo or apartment would cost about $1,700 per month — far more than the monthly payments for an MHC home.

Apart from affordability, the main draw of MHCs or land lease communities for buyers is the chance to have a yard of one’s own and to become part of a cohesive neighbourhood, according to MacLean. If you’re picturing stereotyped trailer parks, you would probably be pleasantly surprised by the tidy homes, well-kept yards and neighbourhood feel that characterize Parkbridge’s communities.

“We have communities in Canada where, if you drove in, you’d have no idea this was a manufactured home community,” MacLean says. “Manufactured homes aren’t meant to be moved. They’re not on wheels, and people build decks and landscaped gardens around them.”

Homeowners in land lease communities commit to keep up the maintenance of their homes and yards when they move in. And because they are able to build equity in their homes, they have a vested interest in making sure their properties are well-kept and attractive.

As the owner-operator of land lease communities, Parkbridge acts much like a small municipality, managing and maintaining infrastructure and services. Site rental fees in land lease communities go towards maintenance and repairs of water and sewer systems, sidewalks and roadways, common amenities such as parks and playgrounds, collection and remittance of property taxes and fees, as well as professional management and maintenance of the community. Snow removal, grass-cutting and amenities upkeep are also traditionally covered. “We’re in it for the long haul,” says MacLean. “We care about our homeowners’ enjoyment and investment in their home and community”.

To enhance the sense of community, almost all of Parkbridge’s communities offer recreation centres to hold events, such as crafts for kids, shuffleboard games and community dinners. Many also feature playgrounds and other amenities. That makes the communities particularly popular with both retirees and young families.

For retirees or empty nesters, points out MacLean, buying into a Parkbridge community can offer a chance to free up equity from the sale of their previous home and still have a yard of their own and a sense of belonging. At the other end of the spectrum, young families often purchase land lease homes as an affordable stepping stone into home ownership. “These are cohesive, supportive neighbourhoods with a strong sense of community pride,” MacLean says. “And they offer a chance to fill a very real gap in the housing market.”",[],671,0.9494014312073017

While land lease is a well-established home ownership model in many countries, it is less well-known in Canada.

Parkbridge’s land lease communities are particularly attractive for young families looking to buy their first home and for retirees looking to free up money for life’s other priorities while still continuing to maintain and build equity. Parkbridge is a leading Canadian developer and owner-operator of land lease communities, with 55+ communities in Canada.

As Parkbridge continues to grow, it’s helping Canadians better understand how land lease works and why the option can be beneficial. Here are some frequently asked questions about land lease. To learn more, visit parkbridge.com.

Q: Is buying a home in a land lease community like buying a traditional home?

Yes! Buyers work with a real estate agent and lawyer and obtain financing as required before closing the purchase and sale agreement. Those wishing to buy a home in a Parkbridge community must make an application with the community management team and then sign a site lease. Parkbridge recommends you complete this application and have it approved before finalizing any home purchase.

Q: How do I get a mortgage on a home in a land lease community?

Homeowners in Parkbridge communities work with mortgage brokers and financial institutions to obtain financing with Canada’s major banks and credit unions. Thanks to industry awareness efforts in recent years, financing on land lease homes is now broadly available at many financial institutions and credit unions across Canada.

Q: Do homes in land lease communities increase in value?

As with other forms of home ownership, appreciation value depends on a number of factors, like location and the state of the economy. At one Parkbridge community, homes purchased between 2007 to 2017 rose in price an average of seven per cent per year. Some homes more than doubled in just six years.

Q: What legislation supports homeowners in land lease communities?

Land lease communities across Canada are governed by provincial legislation and regulations that differ slightly across jurisdictions but in all cases enforce the rights and responsibilities of both residents and land lease owners.

Q: What happens when a resident’s lease expires? Are they able to renew?

Yes, residents are able to renew their lease. The homeowner works with the land lease operator on renewing the lease agreement.

Q: Is the lease transferable upon sale of a home?

Yes. This is called an Assignment of Lease and is covered under provincial legislation.

Q: How does the new owner enter into a lease agreement with the land lease owner?

The seller informs the community management team of their intention to sell. Before finalizing the home purchase, the buyer completes a lease application.

Q: How much is rent?

Rent varies from community to community and is regulated by the respective provincial governments. Rent depends on the local market as well as the services and amenities that are provided in that community.

Q: Are land lease communities different than Manufactured Home Communities?

Manufactured Home Communities (MHCs) are the earliest example of land lease. Today, Parkbridge has modular, manufactured and traditional-build homes.

Q: Why do homeowners choose to live in a Parkbridge land lease community?

On average, the purchase price of a home in a land lease community is up to 30-per-cent less than a traditional freehold home in the same area. Parkbridge’s land lease communities are also professionally managed, often with quality amenities, which helps create a sense of community where residents feel supported and connected. Amenities can include community centres, pools, playgrounds and fitness centres. Services can include snow removal and maintenance of common areas. Amenities and services vary by community, depending on the needs and wants of the owners.

And a final advantage is that unlike other developers, Parkbridge maintains a presence in the community, investing alongside homeowners to ensure there is ongoing, thoughtful attention to community infrastructure, standards and amenities.

With its images of rusting trailers and chronically under-employed bad boys, the show reinforced negative stereotypes about ‘trailer parks.’ And the bad press spread to take in land lease communities and Manufactured Homes too.

Here’s the thing: such communities are as different from trailer parks as chalk and cheese. Read on for some facts that correct some common myths and misconceptions.

Fact # 1: Manufactured home ownership is a valuable option for middle income families and retirees

Mark Bourree, Senior Regional Manager, Property Operations for Parkbridge (the largest land lease owner-operator and developer in Canada says the option is increasingly popular with people of all ages and stages, but particularly with seniors and young people starting out in life. For young families, manufactured homes provide an option that costs up to 30 per cent less than a conventional home. This is because you’re paying for the house, but not the land underneath it; hence the term ‘land lease community’. And unlike apartments, they offer a yard where kids can play.

As for seniors: “A lot of people downsize from their empty nest home and move into a community of manufactured homes,” Kemp says. The two main advantages: the reasonable price ensures seniors can easily live on their pension while freeing up money for life’s other priorities. And “if you are away for a period of time, your house is absolutely secure because neighbours watch over it.”

Fact #2: Manufactured Homes are a good investment

“The law of supply and demand works in this industry as well,” says Kemp. “Let’s say you bought your home for $40,000 about 20 years ago and you’ve taken really good care of it. Now you’re ready to sell.” Depending on the location and condition, the same home might well sell for more than a new home today (in the range of $200,000), he says.

Fact # 3: A Manufactured Home is not a mobile home

The vast majority of manufactured homes are moved once and remain in place throughout their lifetime – they don’t have a hitch or wheels. As well, manufactured home communities are becoming increasingly known as ‘land lease communities.’ Canada’s largest land lease owner-operator and developer, Parkbridge, has modular, manufactured and new traditional build homes to choose from, depending on the location and community.

Fact # 4: Manufactured Homes are well-built and follow the same building codes as freehold homes

For the last 30 years, manufactured homes have been required to meet a code called Z240, similar to the requirements in Canada’s National Building Code. “They have the exact same criteria as any freehold home built in Canada,” says Bouree. Expect a solid frame, full insulation, energy saving features, gyproc walls, and a roof meant to last 25 years.

Bourree says that manufactured homes are manufactured in the tightly controlled environment of an indoor factory, then moved into place on the back of a semi trailer truck. “They’re well-designed and engineered,” he says. “And they have to be able to withstand the winds going down the highway at 100 kilometres an hour.”

Fact # 5: There is an incredible sense of community among neighbours

Many Manufactured Home Communities offer enviable locations close to major cities, as well as the kinds of amenities that draw people together, from playgrounds to community centres and hiking and walking trails. Because the communities are professionally managed, owners commit to maintaining their homes to the standards of the community as part of their lease. “It’s like having a condo board, only without the drama,” says Bourree. “Most of our residents stay for a very long time.”

What’s more, points out Kemp, unlike an apartment building, where you might be acquainted with the neighbours across the hall but not those above or below you, people in manufactured home communities tend to know each other well. “Often they organize barbecues and bingo games and garage sales,” he says. “Plus knowing your neighbours creates security – residents will question a stranger in the park.”

Many people have an expectation “that there’s only one way to study, or one magic approach,” says McGrath. “The reality is that everyone’s brain works differently, and we are all very diverse learners.”

“Students who are struggling to get into a pattern of effective study … should reach out to one of the academic support centres on their campus. They can provide resources to help a student orient their thinking into the type of learner they are, and they can then cascade down and contemplate some really effective behaviours that will help make study time more practical.”

That might mean adjusting the way you revise depending on the topic you’re studying, and the tools you’re using.

“If I’m reading content, I can sit on my sofa (to study),” says McGrath. “If I have to write, it has to be at a desk … and I need background noise, because it stimulates my brain activity.”

There are also other variables to consider, says McGrath, including where a student tends to study: At home, in a dorm, or – for commuter students – shared spaces like libraries or cafes.

“Campuses have abundant spaces where students can really hunker down and focus with minimal distraction,” he says. “On commuter campuses I encourage (students) to think about finding a good spot on campus and accessing that space part of their regular schedule, and I encourage them to leverage their commute time (to study).”

For these students, accessing study materials in audio format may be an ideal way to review lectures or readings on the go.

Scheduling dedicated, uninterrupted study time is also an ideal strategy for those who are looking to become more efficient with reviewing course material and preparing for exams.

“The phone gets turned off, (you’re) free from distraction, in a physical environment where (you) feel comfortable and not overstimulated, and where (you) can maintain focus,” he says. “And don’t schedule anything for longer stretches than 30-minute chunks.”

That’s because our brains tend to wander after 30 minutes of intense focus, and we need to take a minute break to re-set.

“Make studying a regular habit,” adds McGrath. “Many students assume the only time they need to study is when they have a deadline but engaging in on-going review will help optimize their learning, so when deadlines approach, they don’t have to cram.”

“It’s really a test of give-and-take, and trying different techniques, but it starts with having an honest awareness of what someone’s particular approach to learning is.”",[],499,0.8888415963214872

But campuses are full of equally important resource spaces that all first-years should familiarize themselves with if they want to make the most of their experience. And this can begin before classes even start

“Everybody’s got a Twitter feed, everybody’s got an Instagram page, says Steve Joordens, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto. ""As soon as students know what university they are going to, they should follow some of those (accounts).”

Signing up to participate in your school’s orientation program is another great first step in learning not only where the arts or sciences buildings are, but also health and wellness services, writing centres, financial aid, learning support, counselling, career centres, LGBTQ+ or Indigenous groups, and other on-campus resources.

And don’t discount the value of connecting with older students. Humber College, for example, has a first-year experience program that matches new students with upper-year mentors, and runs events informed by student needs.

“It is important for students to be connected to the campus community, because often that connection leads to … a greater opportunity for success academically and personally,” says Ian Crookshank, Humber’s dean of students.

“Through connecting with the campus community, students are not only more informed in terms of what support is available, but also better able to recognize when things aren’t going quite right. During a student’s journey, bumps in the road are inevitable. Challenges can arise academically, emotionally, financially and personally. There are some students who have a support system that can help them through the bumps. For other students, that support system may need a little bolstering.

“The campus community can help to normalize what a student is going through, let them know that for every valley there will be a peak, and provide them with several ways to help find what they need to (do to) overcome. This is done by accessing resources, but also having … an open door to a space where they can be themselves, or a connection to an opportunity to grow.”

Crookshank points out that while there is a fair amount of well-intentioned discussion about the need to increase the resilience of today’s youth, that mentality also misses the point that for many of our students, life to this point has not been easy.

“The thing that is sometimes in need of development for those in first year is an understanding of how to access that resilience and resourcefulness in a post-secondary context, how to remain positive and ask for help. That’s where connection to the campus, learning about the resources, understanding the culture, etc. can be incredibly helpful. And when they feel overwhelmed or challenged, they know that there is an incredible group of people who want to see them succeed and are there to help.”

Ultimately, students should remind themselves that university and college life is about more than just academia: It’s about feeling whole and at home.",[],497,0.7778623208338835

Leaving friends, family and familiarity behind is tough, but a new community can be found on your campus – you just need to know where (and how) to look.

“It is absolutely true that our antidote to all the stress that life throws at us is our social connections,” says Steve Joordens, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto. “So, when you pick somebody up and transplant them somewhere else, they lose that connection.”

Not only is it normal, but actually expected for first-year students to have bouts of loneliness, and in turn feel more stressed than normal, he says. The best way to overcome those feelings of loneliness and stress is to create a new social network where you are.

“Connect with others who share some interests that you share,” Joordens suggests. Look into clubs, teams or organizations on campus that are devoted to one of your areas of interest, and join in. Making friends with people who share your hobbies – and allowing you to discuss familiar topics – can really help students make new social connections.

If walking into a room full of strangers seems overwhelming, Joordens suggests connecting with one of the organizers or members online, first.

“A lot of students, especially with phones and social networks being so powerful, (find it) low-risk to reach out to somebody in a chat,” he says. “Find that first friend, have chats on social media, and get comfortable with that person on that platform. … It’s a less risky, more controlled way to get to know somebody, but don’t let it become a crutch or a hard chasm to cross.”

Ultimately, says Joordens, connecting in-person is the goal. A simple strategy to tackle that first get-to-know-you conversation is to ask the other person questions about themselves, which often makes the conversation go smoother.

“The reason we all find it hard (to make new friends) is we all have a mild form of social anxiety, (or fear) we will do something that makes a fool of ourselves,” says Joordens. “That’s a threat, and that threat makes our sympathetic nervous system act up. So, when we’re about to walk into a room full of strangers, that’s what makes us feel nervous.”

The trick is learning to control that fear. “Go on YouTube and look for guided relaxation videos. Rather than telling yourself to stop being nervous, you can learn to tell yourself to relax,” Joordens says.

Ultimately, being able to connect human-to-human and walk into a room full of strangers is an important skill for future success, and students will have to continue facing that fear long into adulthood.

“Yes, it will be uncomfortable, but you’ve got to do it,” Joordens says. You never know, you may make life-long friends in the process.",[],480,0.9153697796042559

Since the legalization of recreational cannabis use in Canada in 2018, there has been high demand for skilled workers in all areas of the industry.

The majority of job opportunities focus on cannabis cultivation, harvesting, processing, manufacturing, and administration. Educational programs to train or certify students in these areas have been few and far between, however. Those that do exist are located far outside of the GTA.

Meeting industry demands

Centennial College is set to launch a new cannabis cultivation and processing certificate program this fall that will bridge this gap and cultivate much-needed workers in Toronto.

The entry-level part-time program will offer both theoretical and hands-on education in the cultivation of cannabis, from seed to sale.

“Most of the existing cannabis cultivation programs in Ontario are in Niagara, or Guelph, or the hinterland, and there’s a dearth of talent for us here in Toronto,” says Joe Goldfarb, curriculum developer and instructor for the new program. “We saw a gap here in the city that needed to be filled.”

Joe Goldfarb - Curriculum Developer & Instructor, Cannabis Cultivation Program, Centennial College

Cultivating the best

Students in Centennial’s new cannabis cultivation and processing program will take courses in a blended format, with practical experience at a licensed cannabis production facility. “Our program is split into two parts,” says Goldfarb, who is also the head of operations at local cannabis company Medz Cannabis and so has an insider’s understanding of the industry.

“There’s an online component and an on-site component. We’ve paired the theoretical learning with on-site learning here at our facility. Students will get hands-on experience working with cannabis plants. They’ll be helping with every single facet of the industry.”

The hands-on learning will cover working with nutrients, pest control management, different stages in the growth cycle of a cannabis plant, pruning and trimming, sanitization, documentation, and compliance with government policy, laws and regulations. It’s a well-rounded, comprehensive education. “This isn’t happening anywhere else in terms of cannabis industry education,” says Goldfarb.

The program’s courses include introduction to cannabis studies, cannabis law, cannabis cultivation theory, cannabis cultivation systems, cannabis processing theory, and formulation of cannabis products.

A reputation of excellence

Over the past 50 years, Centennial College has transformed itself from a local community college into a worldly institution, with a presence in countries like China, India, South Korea, and Brazil.

Centennial has a record of exemplary teaching, innovative programming, and extensive partnership building. This new program fits the bill in terms of the college’s reputation as a forward-thinking school.

There’s a present and growing need for well-trained staff in cultivation facilities across Canada. Centennial’s new program will prepare graduates for job opportunities in cultivation operations, quality assurance and quality control, processing, consumer education, and more.

Centennial’s cannabis cultivation and processing program is the first of its kind and is open to anyone (aged 19+) who wants to explore a career in the cannabis industry. For more information, visit centennialcollege.ca.",[],486,0.9650644499223527

That’s because evidence suggests that artificial intelligence — or AI — will be one of the leading economic drivers of our time, with an estimated worldwide business value of $3.9 trillion USD by the year 2022.

Canada has quickly become a leader in the AI space, with research strength and transformative startups. In fact, Montreal has the highest concentration of researchers and students of deep learning (a subgroup of machine learning in AI) in the world, and Toronto has the highest concentration of AI startups in the world. As AI and machine learning are increasingly changing and improving how we do business, companies don’t want to be left behind. And with more companies adopting these technologies, the demand for high-quality talent is on the rise.



The university recognized the demand for data scientists within organizations, and the small talent pool, and decided to bridge the gap. The program aims to help put students on the right path toward a career as a data analyst, data engineer, data scientist, or AI practitioner.

Students in the program have the opportunity to work in cross-functional teams to translate learnings into business insights and help guide business decisions. “The majority of our students are mature students who have some work experience and are looking to reskill or upskill within their careers,” says Beitinjaneh, “and what they learn can be applied directly to their work.”

Jean-Olivier Pitre, a data engineer with the Société de transport de Montréal (STM), Montreal’s municipal transport service, enrolled in the program to advance his skills in turning data into insight, and it paid off. “Because of the advanced analytics work that I produced with my team on how to optimize service on the Montréal metro's orange line, I received the Coup de Coeur STM award, an award given to STM employees who did astounding work for the customer experience and/or directly contributed to our 2025 organizational plan,” he says. “This wouldn’t have been possible without this program. McGill gave me the knowledge and the tools, but especially the roadmap and strategy on how to generate value from data in order to make a positive impact in the real world — in our case, to millions of weekly users”

The public sector industry has shown notable gain, with a trend of 54,000 net new jobs in the last year. Compared to 12 months earlier, the survey found that jobs in the industry grew by 1.8 percent and the public sector’s total number of employees increased by 33,000.

“About 3.6 million Canadians are employed in the public sector,” says Carmen Sicilia, associate professor and director of indigenous relations at McGill University School of Continuing Studies. “These public service positions are in every single community — not just in large cities, but small communities including Indigenous communities in Northern Canada.”

Starting a career in the public sector

The School of Continuing Studies at McGill prepares individuals for jobs in the present and future, regardless of whether they’re launching their career, growing their career, or newcomers to Canada who need to rebuild their career. Launched in 2018, the undergraduate-level certificate in public administration and governance was so successful that inquiring students had to be put on a waiting list. To follow up on that success and meet the demand, McGill has launched a graduate-level diploma in the subject which has already began accepting applications and will launch this fall.

“The certificate and diploma in public administration and governance aim to help learners prepare for a career in the public sector or advance their current career positions,” says Sicilia. “The curriculum aims to strengthen students’ managerial and leadership competencies and equip them with the knowledge, analytical skills, and problem-solving strategies that are critical for success in public service organizations.”

The new programs are both completely online and follow a blended approach, meaning classes are live, allowing students to connect and interact with the course lecturer and classmates, alongside parts that are self-directed and can be done online from anywhere the student wishes to do classwork.

“Individuals don’t have to leave their jobs, their families, or their communities,” says Sicilia. “What’s so fascinating is the sharing that goes on in the classroom. Because individuals are working in various communities, learning doesn’t just come from the lecturers, but from the learners themselves.”

“The jobs are there,” says Sicilia, adding that programs in public administration and governance, like the one at McGill, give people the opportunity to get access to these careers. “We listened to what the needs are from the organizations and we asked them specifically, ‘What competencies and skills do you want individuals to come out with? Don’t give us course names. What tools or knowledge do they need to have?’”

In today’s world, nothing is quite as distinct. “The lines are blurring. If you ask students in full-time programs or those in continuing education, they’re all looking for flexible learning opportunities: experiential learning, learning on the job, in a lab, online,” explains Emily Milic, public relations and communications manager for Humber College. “These days, flexible learning is embedded in the DNA of most curriculums. Full-time and continuing education students have families and commitments and flexibility is key to a successful program.”

Continuing education has also changed in recent years. “It continues to provide opportunities for individuals to learn new skills or improve their existing skills, but employers are now working with the continuing education colleges on planning curriculums and ensuring their employees get what they need from the continuing education experience,” explains Milic.

Humber, for example, has an education training solutions department to directly work with individual companies. “The group works with individual companies directly to work out their needs and help them devise curriculums to reach those goals, whether that means single-day training sessions or a long-term course series,” says Milic. Most continuing education providers have relationships with corporate partners, and the arrangements are variable, but the goal is that these programs will provide educational options that work for both the learner and the corporate organization.

Why are corporations so involved in the structure of continuing education? One term used to describe today’s continuing education is open-loop learning. “It used to be that you went to school to get your credentials, then you went on to work at your career. Typically these days, though, you’re in and out of continuing education throughout your career. We are facilitating that by creating programs that meet the needs of those individuals and their employers,” says Milic.

This certainly suits the way people want to learn and the way industry wants and needs them to learn. And while industry is involved in curriculum across the board, the relationships vary. In some cases, institutions of learning are working with companies to develop very specific programs for employees, to help them develop professionally and personally. In other cases, employers help support employee advancement by offering educational assistance programs to employees.

One such relationship is between Walmart Canada and Humber as lead education partner. Walmart offers financial assistance to associates and their families, providing opportunities for tuition reimbursement and demonstrating their commitment to their employees.

Humber’s Barrett Centre for Technology and Innovation has partnership agreements with several sector companies who are working together to develop education geared to employment pathways and recruitment opportunities for Humber students and graduates. Initiatives include STEM outreach activities, robotic equipment and audio-visual systems.

The body was discovered five days after the 33-year-old Rivera disappeared on Lake Piru, where her son was found July 8 alone a few hours later on a boat the two had rented, the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office said.

Authorities would not immediately say if the person found was Rivera, but said the day after she disappeared that they believed she drowned in the lake northwest of Los Angeles. A 2 p.m. press conference was scheduled.

Search crews found the body floating in the northeast area of the lake, authorities said. The body would be flown 40 miles (64 kilometres) to the coroner’s office in Ventura, Sheriff’s Capt. Eric Buschow said. Rivera’s family has been notified of the discovery.

The lake an hour’s drive from Los Angeles was searched by dozens of divers working in waters with little visibility, with help from sonar and robotic devices combing the bottom and helicopters and drones searching above.

“I can’t imagine what it’s like for her parents, her family,” Buschow said. “It takes an emotional toll on the search teams too.”

Rivera played singing cheerleader Santana Lopez for six seasons on the Fox musical-comedy “Glee.”

If she is declared dead, she will become the third major cast member from the show to die in their 30s.

Cory Monteith, one of the show’s leads, died at 31 in 2013 from a toxic mix of alcohol and heroin.

And co-star Mark Salling, who Rivera dated at one point, killed himself in 2018 at age 35 after pleading guilty to child pornography charges.

Rivera had experience boating on the lake in Los Padres National Forest, authorities said.

Surveillance video shows Rivera and her son, Josey Hollis Dorsey, leaving on the rented boat.

When the boat failed to return, its vendor found the vessel drifting in the northern end of the lake late Wednesday afternoon with the boy asleep on board. He told investigators that he and his mother had been swimming and he got back into the boat but she didn’t, according to a sheriff’s office statement.

The boy was wearing a life vest, and another life jacket was found in the boat along with Rivera’s purse and identification.

Rivera is believed to have drowned “in what appears to be a tragic accident,” the statement said.

The Hollywood star is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a “wife-beater.” He strongly denies abusing Heard.

Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in 2015. Heard, a model and actress, filed for divorce the following year.

Depp said the couple separated after an argument that followed Heard’s 30th birthday party in April 2016. The actor said that just before the party he had attended a meeting and been told that his former business managers had “stolen my money.”

Asked how much was stolen, Depp said “this is a ludicrous amount to have to state, it’s quite embarrassing — apparently I had made $650 million,” much of it through his involvement with the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films.

Depp added that in addition to losing the $650 million (US) he was “$100 million in the hole because they had not paid the government my taxes for 17 years.” Depp and his former business managers settled a legal dispute over the alleged fraud in 2018.

Depp alleges that after the party he went to bed to read, and that Heard began accusing him of ruining her birthday dinner before throwing a “haymaker” at him.

Depp’s lawyer, David Sherborne, asked him to explain the American slang term for the judge, Andrew Nicol.

“A haymaker is a type of a wild swing, a roundhouse punch … effective if it reaches the target,” Depp said.

Heard is attending the three-week trial and is scheduled to give her own version of events later.

Grandson of Elvis Presley has died at age 27, agent says

The son of Lisa Marie Presley, Benjamin Keough — brother to “Mad Max: Fury Road” actress Riley Keough — has died. He was 27.

Presley’s representative Roger Widynowski said in a statement Sunday to The Associated Press that she was “heartbroken” after learning about the death of her son Benjamin Keough. He is the grandson of the late Elvis Presley.

TMZ reports that Keough died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound Sunday in Calabasas, California.

“She is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter Riley,” Widynowski said in the statement. “She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.”

Presley had Keough and actress Riley Keough, 31, with her former husband Danny Keough. She also had twins from another marriage.

Rapper Lil Marlo dead; police see targeted shooting

The Atlanta-based rap artist known as Lil Marlo has died, his record label said Sunday.

Quality Control Music announced the death of Rudolph “Marlo” Johnson in a social media post, saying he will be remembered as “a man of great talent who feared nothing.” A statement from the Atlanta Police Department says a man named Rudolph Johnson was killed late Saturday in what investigators believe was a targeted shooting.

Officers responded to a single-car wreck on Interstate 285 in Atlanta at about 11:30 p.m. Saturday night and found the driver, later identified as Johnson, dead inside his vehicle, the statement said. Investigators believe Johnson was shot while driving and was the intended target.

Police identified Johnson as 30 years old, while the social media post from Quality Control Music says he was born in 1993, which would make him around 27.

Johnson emerged in 2017 collaborating with rapper and friend Lil Baby on “2 The Hard Way.” Earlier this year, the up-and-coming rapper released his project “1st & 3rd” featuring Future, Gucci Mane and Lil Baby.

Rapper Lil Yachty, Johnson’s label mate, said on social media that he and Johnson had worked on four songs the morning of his death.

Library of Congress to honour author Colson Whitehead

Colson Whitehead keeps winning awards.

Already this year’s recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the Orwell Prize for political fiction, Whitehead is now being honoured by the Library of Congress. On Monday, it announced that he had won the Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction.

Whitehead, 50, is the youngest winner of the lifetime achievement prize, which the library has previously given to Toni Morrison, Philip Roth and Denis Johnson, among others. He is the first author to win Pulitzers for consecutive works of fiction — “The Underground Railroad” and “The Nickel Boys,” for which he won in April.

“As a kid, I’d walk into great New York City libraries like the Schomburg and the Mid-Manhattan, on a field trip or for a school assignment, and feel this deep sense of awe, as if I’d stumbled into a sacred pocket in the city,” Whitehead said in a statement. “I hope that right now there’s a young kid who looks like me, who sees the Library of Congress recognize Black artists and feels encouraged to pursue their own vision and find their own sacred spaces of inspiration.”

She was 57.

Travolta confirmed his wife’s death in an Instagram post late Sunday. He said she died after a two-year battle with breast cancer.

“It is with a very heavy heart that I inform you that my beautiful wife Kelly has lost her two-year battle with breast cancer,” Travolta said of his wife of 28 years. “She fought a courageous fight with the love and support of so many.”

Preston had a lengthy career on film and television and at times appearing in films with her husband. They had three children together.

Preston and Travolta were married at a midnight ceremony in Paris in 1991 while the couple were expecting their first son, Jett.

In January 2009, Jett Travolta, 16, died after a seizure at the family’s vacation home in the Bahamas. The death touched off a court case after an ambulance driver and his attorney were accused of trying to extort $25 million from the actors otherwise they would release sensitive information about their son’s death.

Travolta testified during a criminal trial that ended in a mistrial and was prepared to testify a second time, but decided to stop pursuing the case. He cited the severe strain the case and his son’s death had caused the family.

Both Preston and Travolta returned to acting, with Preston’s first role back in the Nicholas Sparks adaptation, “The Last Song,” which starred Miley Cyrus and her future husband, Liam Hemsworth.

They had two other children, daughter Ella Bleu in 2000 and son Benjamin in 2010.

Travolta and Preston met while filming 1988’s “The Experts.”

They last starred together in the 2018 film “Gotti,” with Travolta playing John Gotti and Preston playing the crime boss’s wife, Victoria.

“Kelly’s love and life will always be remembered,” Travolta wrote on Instagram. “I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don’t hear from us for a while. But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal.”

The search will resume Sunday morning, according to a Twitter post Saturday evening by the Ventura County Sheriff’s Department.

Divers, helicopters, drone aircraft and cadaver dogs have been trying to locate Rivera for four days. Officials said Saturday they have also used sonar equipment but said visibility in the lake has been poor. The depths of Lake Piru range from 10 to 90 feet, creating other challenges.

“Our goal is to bring the family closure,” Ventura County Sheriff Sgt. Marta Bugarin told reporters. “It’s a traumatic time for them. They’re devastated, obviously.”

The 33-year-old Rivera was reported missing Wednesday afternoon after her four-year-old son was found in a rental boat on the lake by himself.

The Santa Clarita native gained praise for her performance as a gay cheerleader in the high school musical drama.

Security video footage released by the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office showed the actress and her son boarding the rental boat by themselves and heading out onto the lake about 1 p.m. Wednesday.

The pontoon boat soon became a spot on the lake’s horizon.

Hours later, after she hadn’t returned to the boat on time, staff of the rental business went out to search for her. At 4:47 p.m., 911 dispatchers received a call from a woman who said, “We have a missing person. We found a little girl in one of the boats by herself and her mom is nowhere to be found.” The girl the woman spoke of was in fact Rivera’s little boy.

Sheriff’s officials said the boy was found asleep on the boat, wearing his life vest. They later learned that Rivera and her son were swimming together in the lake and that he was able to get back on the boat, but she was not.",[],318,0.9502929585268446

In a one-on-one conversation Friday on Pinkett Smith’s series “Red Table Talk,” she said she was reluctantly discussing Alsina’s reported comments because of the public speculation they provoked.

What started as a friendship and a family effort to help Alsina with his health about four years ago became a “different kind of entanglement” at a time when she and Smith thought their marriage was over, Pinkett Smith said.

“An entanglement? A relationship,” Smith said, prodding his wife to be more specific, alluding to the Facebook Watch show’s dedication to candid discussion.

“Yes, it was a relationship. Absolutely. I was in a lot of pain. I was very broken,” she replied. “Now, in the process of that relationship, I definitely realize that you can’t find happiness outside of yourself. ... I would definitely say we did everything that we could to get away from each other, only to realize that that wasn’t possible.”

At one point in the conversation they echoed each other, saying: “We ride together. We die together. Bad marriage for life,” an allusion to a catchphrase in Smith’s “Bad Boys” franchise.

The two have been married since 1997 and have two children, Jaden and Willow. Each appeared uncomfortable at times during their exchanges on the talk show.

A representative for Alsina didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Pinkett Smith, who starred in two “Matrix” films, questioned why Alsina would bring the episode up again, saying he had broken off communication with her. She also pushed back at the idea that Smith had given her permission for the affair. Alsina was quoted in an interview as saying the actor had given his “blessing.”

“The only person that can give permission in that particular circumstance is myself,” Pinkett Smith said, then cut Alsina slack for his remarks.

“I could actually see how he would perceive it as permission because we were separated amicably. And I think he also wanted to make it clear that he is not a homewrecker, because he’s not,” she said.",[],363,0.9808029362871875

For the past four months, the legendary Toronto stage that’s hosted the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Police has gone dark, and its famed checkerboard floors immortalized in the Tragically Hip’s “Bobcaygeon” left empty.

Like most smaller Canadian music venues, the future is anything but certain.

“The live-venue industry right now in Canada is on the verge of bankruptcy,” Cohen said.

“We’re not opening, probably, until the end of this year — maybe next year ... We have no income coming in whatsoever. It’s a bad scene.”

Along with several other indie concert venue owners, Cohen has been making noise about the troubling years ahead for Canada’s live music scene in hopes the federal government will take more action.

There was a glimmer of hope on Tuesday when Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault outlined a program that lets owners of for-profit venues apply for a piece of $20 million promised to support the live music sector.

The money will be divided among numerous corners of the industry, including venues, concert promoters, booking agents, managers and music festivals. The funding is part of the second phase of support in the $500-million emergency support measures introduced in May for Canada’s arts and culture organizations.

Anyone who’s granted approval will receive a minimum contribution of $5,000 that’s supposed to last until the end of September.

Beyond the live music business, the federal government has earmarked $5 million for the recording industry that will be administered by Factor and Musicaction, which specialize in developing and supporting Canadian music talent.

Erin Benjamin, chief executive of the Canadian Live Music Association, which advocates for the industry, called the move by Canadian Heritage to support venues “a good start” that needs to be built upon in short order.

“It’s better than nothing,” she said.

“It’ll help some companies for a very short amount of time ... but we’re not done here. We can’t be done.”

While Cohen doesn’t know if he’ll qualify for a portion of the venue funding, he’s skeptical about how much it’ll actually help the Horseshoe.

“I’ll be able to pay two weeks of rent,” Cohen said, pointing out it’s roughly $40,000 a month for the downtown location.

“It’ll be something, and we’ll be grateful for it ... but I’m skeptical until I actually see the payments.”

He suspects the Horseshoe may also fail to meet some of the requirements outlined on the Factor website. Among them, a venue must have booked at least 50 per cent Canadian musicians at its venue last year to qualify.

“Horseshoe Tavern was open 360 days last year, I don’t think we wrote down which bands were Canadian and weren’t. I don’t think we even know,” Cohen said.

“The eligibility makes no sense.”

Smaller venues have been able to tap into other financial support measures, which include the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the emergency wage subsidy.

In Toronto, city council recently passed legislation that allows property owners to claim a tax break of 50 per cent tax on spaces that operate primarily as live music venues. The intention is for those savings to trickle down to the tenants who are still not allowed to reopen.

Live venues in other Canadian cities are at different stages in a process many anticipate could stretch well into next year.

Vancouver bars were some of the first to reopen, though several clubs in the city warned that patrons may have been exposed to COVID-19 in recent weeks.

Montreal’s music venues were allowed to legally reopen in late June, but concertgoers have to remain seated and dancing is forbidden.

In Halifax, Karen Spaulding reopened the Carleton Music Bar and Grill in the final days of June, but it hardly feels the same to her.

“It is at half capacity for three days a week, instead of normally five to seven, and it’s acoustic shows only,” she said.

“Just the world, the audience and the guests, all feel different.”

The Carleton operates as a restaurant, which helped Spaulding’s attempt to get the business back on its feet, though she said overall revenues have dropped somewhere between 50 to 75 per cent.

But as much as she’s concerned for her business, she’s also worried about local Canadian musicians who relied on these venues to make a living. That’s motivated her to look for solutions as she faces a long winter that brings a whole new round of questions.

Spaulding said she’s been in conversations with lenders, while also tapping into other government programs that help support her staff. She’s also looking into whether it would be worthwhile to launch streaming online concerts that would “put more money in the artists’ pockets” over the coming months.

“I’m going to personally go out on a limb to keep the venue going,” she said.

“We’re huge believers in live music.”",[],814,0.9127403332725387

It may seem there’s a huge chasm between them, but the space is much less than we think. As we begin to come together again with family and friends — with our community — we talk about the life we lived before the pandemic and look to the life we might live after.

Between Before and After lies what is possible. It’s a space to think, to reflect, to dream, to innovate. It is the space, perhaps, where there is a stillness, like that needed for prayer.

These are lessons captured by Inuit artist Elisapee Ishulutaq and her painting “Tusiarvik (A Place for Prayer)” — in which an understanding of what went before leads to innovation and creation.

“As an artist who participated in the founding of the print studio in Pangnirtung (in Nunavut), Ishulutaq is recognized as a pioneer of artmaking in her community and thus given the respect due an elder,” Christine Lalonde wrote of Ishulutaq, who died in 2018, in the catalogue “Builders.”

“Despite being the elder in the group, Ishulutaq emerged as the most capable and ready to experiment … New directions are not only taken up by emerging artists, they are pursued actively by elder artists whose technical experience allows them to adapt processes to new media with confidence and perhaps innovate further than their younger contemporaries,” wrote Lalonde, associate curator of Indigenous art at the National Gallery of Canada.

In “Vision, Space, Desire: Global Perspectives and Cultural Hybridity,” Indigenous artist and curator Jolene Rickard, quoted by Lalonde, notes that Indigenous artists “have densely packed cultural survival kits that transfer knowledge from one generation to the next, despite unremitting attempts at genocide, culturacide, and other forms of political and philosophical erasure. Native communities or nations have something the world needs to know about: the insight of continuity.”

Instead of forgetting the past, we must learn from it. Let us share our stories, our experiences; let the time we’ve spent become part of our collective knowledge. Then we can weave the past and present in a future that has learned its lessons.",[],347,0.9600049837789724

The break, tacked onto the long tail of “Delirium,” amounted to a five-year gap between LPs — an eternity for an in-demand artist, particularly one who delivered her first three records in roughly the same span.

She began preparing to re-enter the spotlight after getting married last fall. “I was super fit, I had a good routine and I thought, now is really the right time for me, mentally, to take this on again,” she said. The pandemic, of course, foiled her plans.

Goulding, 33, has spent the past few months sequestered in a cottage just outside Oxford with her husband, art dealer Caspar Jopling. Preparing to release her new album, “Brightest Blue,” on July 17 has consisted largely of nerve-racking livestreams with shoddy Wi-Fi and existential questions about the future of her industry. “I’m worried that people are going to get used to seeing their favourite artists at home and they’re not going to want to go back to music venues,” she said.

She’s still eager to bring fans “Brightest Blue,” an album that shows Goulding’s range, bouncing between feature-laden pop-radio fodder and softer, more inward-facing ballads. Even more varied is her list of 10 cultural must-haves, which brings together mementos from her grunge days with recent film festival darlings and, of course, Kate Bush.

Goulding broke from her routines of practising yoga, writing and honing her air-guitar skills to chat about her picks over Zoom. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

1. “Kalimankou Denkou,” by the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir

Someone played it in a studio session and I was immediately transfixed. It was a cathartic thing where it kind of took over my body. I’m inspired by so many different singers, but this felt much deeper than that — like the first time I heard Björk, or Lisa Gerrard in Dead Can Dance, or Cocteau Twins. I thought I knew how a choir was supposed to sound, traditionally. And then this is a whole other technique of singing. It’s just otherworldly and I like anything that makes me feel like I’m not on this planet.

2. “Kate Bush Radio” on Spotify

I’ve always been a fan of Kate Bush, since I was a teenager. I think she was doing something that no one else was doing at the time, when she was making songs like “Running Up That Hill” and even earlier than that: writing these weird ballads that might not have made much sense.

I said “Kate Bush Radio” because I can’t deny that I’m an avid user of music streaming platforms. Why wouldn’t I be? It’s just the most incredible playlist of female artists: Caroline Polachek from Chairlift, Roísín Murphy, Cocteau Twins, Weyes Blood. I love Weyes Blood so much. “Seven Words” is one of my favourite songs of all time. Joni Mitchell, PJ Harvey, Björk. I don’t think you can get better than that.

3. “Two Thousand and Seventeen,” by Four Tet

Four Tet’s been the vibe for quarantine. We put this song on a couple of weeks ago when we went for our first long drive, once we were allowed to go to beauty spots. There was something kind of strange and apocalyptic about driving through the mountains on the first day that we were allowed to go beyond our house and our village. The song just has this sense of unknowing and mysteriousness to it.

4. “Rage Against the Machine,” from Rage Against the Machine

I first heard Rage when I went to my sister’s boyfriend’s house. He was in a band and his brother was in a band, and I fell madly in love with his brother. That was the first time I wanted to play guitar, when I heard Tom Morello playing on “Know Your Enemy.” All my friends had gotten into a grunge phase of Nirvana and Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, and I went a bit further. I got called a goth quite a lot because I had this long black hair and I had my lip pierced. And, no, Nirvana wasn’t enough for me; I needed something more political.

I could win in an air-guitar competition if it was Rage Against the Machine. I promise you. I can’t play them, but I can air guitar the (expletive) out of them.

5. “Capernaum”

This is one of those films where you have to confront every single reality of it — as opposed to last night, when I was watching “Sleepless in Seattle” by myself, drinking Prosecco. This one I watched on a recommendation that I saw online; I think maybe it was Cate Blanchett talking about it. All I knew was that it was based in Lebanon, that it was a female director and that it was about a kid that wanted to sue his parents for giving him life. That’s all I needed to want to watch it.

God, it’s a beautiful film. It makes you forget every single tiny inconvenience in your life. It makes you sad, but it puts a fire in you, makes you want to be a bit more of an activist — and I think it’s really important to watch those things.

6. “Pain and Glory”

I’ve always loved (Pedro) Almodovar’s films. There’s always such an honesty to the characters and you really get to know them in quite an intimate way. But also they’re kind of quirky and dark-humoured, and entertaining enough for you to not be put off by how dark the themes can be. I pick up so many ideas from them.

7. Yung Pueblo

I am careful about who I follow (on social media). That’s not to say I only follow things that I know I will like, because I think that can be quite dangerous, but I do try to follow things that keep my brain in the right place for songwriting. So, for example, (poet and author) Yung Pueblo: he always just bloody knows what to say. He’s preoccupied with the idea that you find love in yourself first before you find love with someone else. “True power is living the realization that you are your own healer, hero and leader.” I very much believe in that.

8. “Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys,” by Viv Albertine

She just has such an interesting life. She was one of the first punk rockers and had to endure so many other egotistical male-fronted punk bands. She was around them all: Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious, and members of the Clash like Paul Simonon — who, weirdly, is my next-door neighbour. She talks about how sexy he is and so, any time he walks out of his door, I start blushing because I think about her describing him in the book.

I love the idea of ’70s London. My dad was in a punk band and my mom was a bit of a punk, so I’m fascinated by that era. But also, “music, music, music; boys, boys, boys; clothes, clothes, clothes” — that is me, really.

9. “Climate Justice,” by Mary Robinson

I work for the UN as an environmental goodwill ambassador. I talk a lot about climate change to my fans. A lot of people say, “What can I read? How can I learn about this? I want to know more.” I would say this is a really great book to start.

It talks about how she went around the world to understand the people at the forefront of climate change. Basically, the poorest people in the world are the ones that are affected the most and those communities are the ones doing the most about it, which is just very ironic to me.

10. “Untitled” by Julie Mehretu

Newly divorced, broke and severely depressed, he had given up on his TV acting career after being repeatedly told that he was too attractive for the roles on offer.

“In Italy, if you’re a good-looking guy you’re not an actor,” he said matter-of-factly. “You’re just someone good-looking.”

But after five months toiling alongside cows and chickens, he got a call from his agent that a team of Polish filmmakers wanted to offer him the role of a Mafia boss in the erotic thriller “365 Days,” a part that required someone Italian and very good-looking.

“I woke up, called my gardening boss and said: ‘I’m not coming in today. My stomach doesn’t feel good,’” the 29-year-old father of two recalled. He boarded a plane to Poland and his life hasn’t been the same since.

Despite a zero per cent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, “365 Days,” directed by Barbara Bialowas and Tomasz Mandes, quickly became a viral sensation when it arrived on Netflix worldwide June 7, following a successful theatrical run in Poland and a limited British release earlier this year.

Scripted in English with occasional subtitled Polish and Italian, the dicey plot clearly didn’t deter viewers: the Sicilian Mafia boss Massimo (Morrone) kidnaps the unsuspecting Laura (Polish newcomer Anna-Maria Sieklucka) and gives her one year to fall in love with him before he’ll free her from his palatial lair.

Amid a growing backlash, critics say it glorifies rape culture and Stockholm syndrome. Fans say it’s been unfairly maligned. What isn’t in dispute is that nearly a month after its streaming debut and with seemingly no promotion, the film remains among Netflix’s Top 10 most watched titles in the United States and other countries, including Australia, Britain, Brazil, France, Spain and India.

Based on the first in a bestselling trilogy of Polish novels by Blanka Lipinska, “365 Days” leans heavily into travel porn, wealth porn and soft-core actual porn, apparently an appealing combination in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis when many viewers have been at home for months on end.

“In a way, it was almost custom-made for pandemic viewing: beautiful people having exotic sex in opulent settings,” said Caetlin Benson-Allott, an associate professor at Georgetown University and an expert on movie viewing habits.

There’s plenty of (simulated) carnality to ogle in the film’s 114 minutes. And since Netflix defines a view as watching a mere two minutes of a title, it’s impossible to know if a majority of viewers watched the full movie or skipped to the more tantalizing scenes.

Teenagers on TikTok were some of the first to spread word of “365 Days” by filming themselves reacting to the sex scenes with a mix of shock and admiration. “I did not expect this kind of movie to be on Netflix; maybe, like, late-night HBO,” Noah Holifield, an 18-year-old Chicagoan whose reaction video has more than 2.6 million views, said in an interview.

Some joke that they too would like to be kidnapped by Massimo, and his catchphrase “Are you lost, baby girl?” is now a meme set to music in which the users eagerly respond, “Yes, daddy!”

Some of the criticism of “365 Days” echoes that of the “50 Shades of Grey” trilogy, another campy book-to-movie slice of erotica featuring a wealthy, powerful man and BDSM. Benson-Allott said the outright dismissal of both franchises was the byproduct of the United States being “still a very puritanical country in a lot of ways.”

“We frown on pornography and judge people for enjoying erotic fiction,” she added.

But it’s hard to ignore that the entire premise of “365 Days” is problematic. Variety’s review blasted the film’s “two flavours of misogyny” and its suggestion “that consent can be obtained retroactively,” while the feminist website Jezebel lamented “how quickly depraved abduction turns to cookie-cutter fairy tale.”

In an open letter to Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings, made public July 2, Welsh singer Duffy — who earlier this year opened up about her own experience being drugged, kidnapped and raped — asked the platform to remove the title, writing, “This should not be anyone’s idea of entertainment, nor should it be described as such, or be commercialized in this manner.”

The streaming service wouldn’t comment for this article, while Morrone emphasized that the story was pure fantasy and that he “would never encourage or want anyone to fall in love with their captor in real life.”

But Goali Saedi Bocci, a clinical psychologist and columnist for Psychology Today, warned against dismissing the issues on the basis of fiction.

“There is clearly quite a bit of misunderstanding about sexual consent and assault” in real life, Bocci said, “and such films only continue to muddy the waters.” The danger is that men and women “can be victims of sexual assault, rape, molestation and not even recognize it as such.

“We have to be extra cautious of the media we consume because, like it or not, these things get into our subconscious,” she said.

Still, the film has racked up fans, as evidenced by Morrone’s Instagram account, which has skyrocketed from fewer than 200,000 followers in January to more than seven million at the end of June. On a night out while visiting Berlin, he was mobbed by German teenagers clamouring for selfies. It’s an unexpected turn for the son of a construction worker and housekeeper who paints, dances (he was a runner-up on the 2016 season of Italy’s “Dancing With the Stars”), plays guitar, sings and writes his own extremely personal music, like a song about his 2018 divorce from Lebanese fashion designer Rouba Saadeh.

After four of his tracks were featured in “365 Days,” Universal Music Group signed him to a global record deal and he’s working on a second album while fielding scripts from Hollywood and Europe. But first, with “365 Days” ending on a cliffhanger and two books still to go in the series, he’ll soon reprise his career-making role in a sequel that will film when pandemic restrictions are lifted.

He teased, “The story is going to be very, very interesting.”

Peter Morgan, the writer and creator of “The Crown,” said that the possibility of a reversal was raised during the show’s planning process.

“As we started to discuss the story lines for Series 5, it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons,” Morgan said in a statement. “To be clear, Series 6 will not bring us any closer to present day — it will simply enable us to cover the same period in greater detail.”

In January, Morgan said that the show’s fifth season was the “perfect time and place to stop” and that Netflix and Sony supported him in the decision.

The show debuted in 2016, with Claire Foy playing a young, newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II in the first two seasons, and focused on the early years of the monarch’s reign and her family’s drama during those years.

In November, Netflix released the third season, starring Olivia Colman as the queen in the 1960s and ’70s. The season follows the queen as she navigates Britain’s political and economic issues, as well as numerous problems with family members, including her two eldest children, Prince Charles and Princess Anne.

A release date has not yet been announced for the fourth season, which will again feature Colman as the queen, and revisit her reign through Margaret Thatcher’s premiership and Prince Charles’ relationship with Princess Diana. Colman will then pass the crown to Imelda Staunton for the fifth season.

The streaming service announced last week that in the fifth instalment Lesley Manville would take over the role of Princess Margaret, who was played in the first two seasons by Vanessa Kirby, and by Helena Bonham Carter in the third and fourth.

“We can’t wait for audiences to see the upcoming fourth season,” said Cindy Holland, vice president of original content for Netflix, “and we’re proud to support Peter’s vision and the phenomenal cast and crew for a sixth and final season.”

She said in a statement that the show was “raising the bar” for each new season.

With its high-profile cast, precise period detail and gilded settings, “The Crown” has also drawn steep bills. It has cost Netflix nearly $150 million (U.S.), about twice as much as the royal family costs British tax payers each year.

Morgan compared the production process to making a movie, as opposed to a serialized drama. Before the pandemic, a team of researchers convened at Morgan’s home once a week, helping weave together story lines for script meetings with documents, transcripts and press clippings they had collected.

There is an expectation to “deliver TV on an annual basis,” he said. “But what we’re making now is feature-film-quality stuff, and no one ever expected you to make 10 feature films a year — because you’d die.”",[],504,0.9626272755581741

John Travolta’s front yard has an airstrip suitable for Boeing. Lady Gaga has a bowling alley. Michael Jordan has an infinity pool with floating grass island. Paris Hilton’s $300,000 doghouse is bigger than my semi. Celine Dion once had a water park with twin slides. Kim Kardashian has a walk-in fridge.

Imagine getting lost while searching for mayo.

But there are exceptions to every rule. Some celebrities are so down to earth, they do not covet a spire in the sky. Some are so comfortable in their own skin, they do not yearn for a petting zoo. Some are free spirits who feel no urge to flaunt the trappings of material excess, especially during a pandemic.

Why, some have no problem using a bathroom that would make a hobo gag.

Demi Moore has a new podcast, “Dirty Diana.” The six-part scripted drama is described as a “show for all of us who are craving connection and searching for a new kind of erotica.” If that’s your thing, you weirdo, the podcast starts Monday.

To plug the project, Moore recently shared two photos on Instagram. And now I’m finding it hard to care about this fictional Diana. I’m too distracted by the real Dirty Demi.

In the snaps, Moore is wearing headphones and army boots. She is plopped on a shabby, floral-print sofa unfit for the Queen’s servants. Based on the MacBook and tablet script display, this is her podcasting studio. But hang on. A few feet away, in the background, is that a toilet? Does this lavatory have wall-to-wall shag carpeting, circa 1976, in the shade of excrement? Is the faucet cabinet cluttered with products and creepy dolls and what appears to be a plastic severed hand holding a sun hat?

Or is that a mushroom lamp? All I know is the serial killer vibe is strong.

But not as strong as the gross energy.

Broadloom in the restroom? That’s not retro decor — it’s a germ factory. A life-sized Joan of Arc statue staring down as you soak in the tub? That’s just spooky. Why does this bathroom have a door to the outside? Why is there a toy monkey squished into the tacky bricks? And when Bruce Willis was in lockdown with his ex a few months back, did he sit on that toilet and talk to that plush simian?

The train is leaving the station. Yippee-ki-yay, little monkey.

This is not a place to do your business — it’s the stuff of nightmares and cognitive dissonance.

Live and let live, that’s my motto. But today I’m changing it to: MAKE A DECISION. Dirty Demi? Make a decision: living room or bathroom? It can’t be both because that’s disgusting. Look at yourself. You’re wearing cropped overalls and podcasting with a beaming smile a few feet away from where someone just did No. 2. Do you think Bill Gates built Microsoft with his elbow on a urinal? How are we supposed to listen to “Dirty Diana” when we know it rumbled to life inside a biohazard lab?

Did Ashton Kutcher get all of the interior design books and ceramic tile in the divorce? Are your dining chairs bidets? Are your bookshelves lined with Charmin? Do you sleep in a shower stall? Does the family room have a beach towel nailed to the wall instead of a flat-screen TV?

Now that Netflix has rebooted “Unsolved Mysteries,” it should investigate these photos.

Dirty Demi is podcasting from a carpeted washroom. That’s like woodworking in the kitchen or doing jumping jacks on the roof. Am I overreacting? Probably! But I’m a germaphobe smack dab in the middle of a pandemic and seeing dated upholstery hug the base of a crapper is giving me the heebie-jeebies. You know what else? On the sink, I see a tube of moisturizer. I see a bottle of alkaline artesian water imported from New Zealand. BUT I DON’T SEE ANY SOAP!

I swear to God, if I knew Moore’s address in Idaho, I’d board a plane in my haz-mat suit and go rescue that MacBook, perched on a makeshift basket stand atop a rustic coffee table in the haze of a million filthy microbes. Poor laptop. Then I’d line Moore and her daughters against the garage and hose them down with Purell. Then I’d board up that podcasting loo and put a Porta Potty in the driveway.

“Three years ago, four years ago, I was in the wilderness, screaming by myself,” Addai-Nyamekye says in a phone interview.

As Addai-Nyamekye explains in the documentary “Above the Law,” debuting Saturday on “CBC Docs POV” and CBC Gem, police officers in the city unlawfully detained him when his car got stuck in the snow in December 2013.

He says they drove him to a remote location and abandoned him in minus 28 Celsius weather in the middle of the night.

After calling 911 for help, Addai-Nyamekye says he was Tasered and assaulted by a constable who chided him for calling the emergency line.

He was left in so much pain he could barely stand and with post-traumatic stress disorder that continues to this day.

Addai-Nyamekye was charged with assaulting a police officer in the incident but was later acquitted after a judge saw video, taken from a police helicopter, showing him being beaten and dragged while handcuffed through the snow by an officer.

He got no compensation, but amid the release of the documentary and a global movement against systemic racism and police brutality, he says he’s happy to finally see some attention on cases like his.

“It’s about time that we let Canadians know that these kind of issues are out here, police brutality is out here, injustice is out here, discrimination: everything is out here,” says Addai-Nyamekye, who was born in Ghana.

“Whatever issues are in the States are out here. And it’s about time that we sit back and look at all these issues, and we address them.”

“Above the Law” explores three cases of excessive force involving the Calgary Police Service, including that of Anthony Heffernan, who was Tasered and shot to death by an officer during a wellness check in a hotel room in March 2015.

The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) initially found there were grounds to charge the officer with a criminal offence, but the Crown later determined a conviction was unlikely and no charges would be laid.

Also featured is the May 2015 arrest of the late Daniel Haworth, whose family says he suffered brain damage from being punched and thrown to the ground while handcuffed. Haworth died of a drug overdose several months later.

Const. Trevor Lindsay, the same officer involved in Addai-Nyamekye’s case, was convicted of aggravated assault on Haworth in June 2019.

According to the filmmakers, Lindsay spent two and a half years on relief from duty with pay while he was awaiting trial. He is now relieved from duty without pay and remains free while he awaits sentencing. He’s expected to appeal his conviction.

“I think in Canada, for a very long time we’ve been acting under the presumption that these are American problems,” says Marc Serpa Francoeur, who co-directed the documentary with Robinder Uppal.

“We’re so inundated with American media and films, and we watch American court cases, all this stuff, but I don’t think we look internally enough.”

Serpa Francoeur says they embarked on the film five years ago and looked into systemic policing issues and accountability mechanisms on the force and on a provincial level.

But he notes: “These problems are not endemic to Calgary.”

“We need to have confidence that officers are being held to account by what is required of them on a legislative level by the Police Act, what is required of them by criminal law,” Serpa Francoeur says.

“There are too many instances where you’re looking at a lot of double standard.”

Addai-Nyamekye has launched several formal complaints about his case, and a lawsuit against Lindsay, the other officers and the Crown prosecutors — none of which have been resolved.

He wonders what his fate would have been if the helicopter had not been around to shoot video that exonerated him.

Addai-Nyamekye wants to see police including Lindsay be held accountable for their actions, and members of the force to undergo more training than the current period of six months.

“I want to see more transparency in that police force,” he says. “I want to see a more multicultural police force, not just white.”

Before the incident, Addai-Nyamekye was a “go-getter” with no health issues, he says.

But after, he faced hefty legal and therapy bills, and was unable to work. He wound up homeless, sleeping on friends’ couches, for six months.

“It’s been a terrible journey, in terms of going back to the scene and having all these bad memories come back, flashbacks and PTSD,” Addai-Nyamekye says.

But he’s hopeful the documentary will shed some light on police brutality and injustices.

And he feels a duty to talk publicly about his experience.

“I’m a victim and I’m a living testimony,” Addai-Nyamekye says. “If I don’t speak up, who else is going to speak up?”

Rivera, 33, disappeared after renting the pontoon boat for three hours Wednesday afternoon and taking it out on Lake Piru in Ventura County, the Sheriff’s Office said Thursday.

The lake an hour’s drive from Los Angeles was searched by dozens of people, most of them divers, with help from helicopters, drones and all-terrain vehicles. The search to recover Rivera’s body continued into the night Thursday before ending for that day.

The area where the boat was found is about nine metres deep. Murky waters heavy with plants made it difficult for divers to see more than about a foot ahead of them, sheriff’s Sgt. Kevin Donoghue said Thursday.

“If the body is entangled on something beneath the water, it may never come back up,” Donoghue said.

Rivera played Santana Lopez, a singing cheerleader in 113 episodes of the musical-comedy “Glee,” which aired on Fox from 2009 until 2015. She also had recurring roles on “The Bernie Mac Show” and “The Royal Family.”

Rivera, a Los Angeles resident, had experience boating on the lake in Los Padres National Forest, Donoghue said.

Surveillance video taken at about 1 p.m. Wednesday shows Rivera and her son, Josey Hollis Dorsey, leaving on the rented boat.

When the boat failed to return, its vendor found the vessel drifting in the northern end of the lake late Wednesday afternoon with the boy asleep on board. He told investigators that he and his mother had been swimming and he got back into the boat but she didn’t, according to a sheriff’s office statement.

The boy was wearing a life vest and another life-jacket was found in the boat along with Rivera’s purse and identification.

Rivera is believed to have drowned “in what appears to be a tragic accident,” the statement said.

The boy, Rivera’s son from her marriage to actor Ryan Dorsey, was safe and healthy and with family members, authorities said. The couple finalized their divorce in June 2018 after nearly four years of marriage.

She called the boy, her only child, “my greatest success, and I will never do any better than him” in her 2016 memoir “Sorry Not Sorry.”

The most recent tweet on Rivera’s account, from Tuesday, read “just the two of us” along with a photo of her and her son.

It appeared increasingly likely she would become the third major cast member from the show to die in their 30s.

Co-star Mark Salling, who Rivera dated at one point, killed himself in 2018 at age 35 after pleading guilty to child pornography charges.

He said he would seek “professional help to educate myself and act appropriately in the future.”

In a statement on Instagram, Simple Plan also apologized to the women as well as to fans who are disappointed by the “regretful situation.”

Animation crew works from home to finish ‘Ron’s Gone Wrong’

Hanging under blankets for audio soundproofing and working around patchy home Wi-Fi, a London animation studio is following the British motto of “keep calm and carry on” during the coronavirus pandemic to complete its first feature film in time for Disney’s planned release early next year.

Some 270 crew members have been working from home on “Ron’s Gone Wrong” in a reimagined production process that Locksmith co-founder Sarah Smith calls a logistical “nightmare.”

Most of the crew is remotely connecting to their office workspaces for digital modelling, rigging, animation and lighting. Editors then assemble the remote work, in some cases with temporarily out-of-sync audio.

“Looking at the stuff in edit was the hardest thing because it was out of sync and with your brain trying to figure out the fine timing of an edit, which in animation is super precise,” Smith said.

Locksmith had been in production on the film for more than two years before the pandemic hit.

The film is set in a world in which talking robots have become children’s best friends. For one 11-year-old boy, things don’t go according to plan when his bot malfunctions.

Voice actors have been unable to record in formal studios during the lockdown. The lead child star had to tell his grandfather to turn off the television and his mother to go offline to conserve home internet bandwidth for a remote recording session, Smith said.",[],952,0.9179044009851002

Music and theatre lovers can’t go to concerts; dance lovers can’t go to recitals; nor art lovers museums; foodies to restaurants. That doesn’t mean the richness of our lives diminishes; it just means we need to look at it differently, for now. There are still plenty of new things to experience — alone and together, in person and virtually. And each week the Star brings you that in our Life, Entertainment and Books section — now At Home.

Art is something we can all experience together — even if we’re apart. Each week, we’re presenting Star readers with a work of art.

This week, Carlos Bunga’s new work, at Toronto’s Museum of Contemporary Art, seems to be made for our times — the strong, visual image evokes a sense of us all staying apart while still being together.

But Bunga created this piece even before the COVID-19 social distancing we’re all experiencing. He methodically organized hundreds of standard packing boxes into a vast grid covering a significant portion of MOCA’s second floor.

Bunga’s work encourages us to situate ourselves within art, and thereby, the conditions of the present.

The boxes are labelless and open-ended, uniformly facing upward, as if offering themselves up to be physically or imaginatively filled. Collectively, the composition suggests an anonymous geography or urban plan, a camp or modular storage system.

There are no specific directions, no designated beginning or end. Each viewer’s passage is entirely their own.

We’ll all get through this together, even as we all take our own slightly different path while doing it.

So in the time of COVID-19, the Star wanted to hear what some of the best in Canada had to say. This is the first in a series of essays that share ideas, emotions, ways to cope — and bring us together.

A friend of mine, when he begins a novel, always reads the last page first. Perhaps he wants no surprises, perhaps he wants to read for voice rather than plot, or, perhaps he doesn’t want to read in the dark. He claims that any novel that can be spoiled by knowing the ending isn’t worth reading. This is the same friend who reads in large gulps, like a dog bolting down food. He is fast, he is efficient — he read “The Idiot” in one day. Is this impatience? Rapacious desire? A need to dominate the narrative?

I have been thinking of my friend these days as we experience the virus that has affected billions of people. What do you do if the ending of this story has not yet been written and you cannot skip to the last page, if the narrative is constantly changing? We would like to believe that we are the authors of this story, not the virus. If it were otherwise, we would all throw up our hands and hug each other.

As a writer of fiction, I live under the illusion that stories can be shaped, that I have control of my characters and their actions, and that I can determine the various voices, and the structure of the novel. Of course, every story has a structure, even ones with dire endings, and just because we don’t like dire endings doesn’t mean that the story can be ignored. In our story, right now, it is difficult to trust the narrator, or the many narrators. And this makes it difficult to keep reading. I mean that literally. Many people I speak with are having a hard time concentrating on reading. Oh, news works. Facts. And more news. And more facts. But at some point, the news bleeds together and so we have a reappearance of the same story. Eternal repetition. Eternal return. But why this difficulty with fiction?

Some say they have found it easier to go back to Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Virginia Woolf. Well-worn stories, where the endings are known. The familiar. Read what is safe. Others, those who can parcel up the world, are devouring fiction. My father reads Revelations and calls to tell me about the pale horse. I am reading “Threshold” by Rob Doyle, a young Irish writer. It is drug and sex addled — a quest for dead writers, a search for meaning. Which is what all novels worth their salt do: they deal in death. They trigger our imaginations, and our memories.

I am also reading “Decameron,” a plague novel by Bocaccio, a story of seven women and three men who go up to a deserted villa in Italy during the Black Death — this is the 14th Century. Each night, for ten days, they gather and tell stories to each other as a distraction or as a reminder of better times. The stories are not about the plague and death, but about life. The tales are often sexual, and full of trickery. Freed from the morality of the city their stories grow wild and wanton. Even the nuns of the villa have their wily ways, seducing a deaf mute who cannot out them.

Another book: “The Plague,” by Camus. Like many a reader, I recently went back and reread the novel, and discovered that Camus had captured, in 1947, the intricate details and emotions and dread that we experience today — the failing economy, the rich going short of practically nothing, letting the weak die, herd immunity, fear of the other, the efficacy/inefficacy of wearing a mask, flattening the curve, ‘doubtful cases’, finger-pointing, the bravery of the doctor, the nurse, the undertaker. Camus of course is dealing with more than a plague foreshadowed by dead rats. He is looking at how the plague is both outside of us and inside of us. He is saying that Yes, our bodies may survive, but if we don’t recognize the interior pestilence, we will be diminished metaphysically. At the end of the novel, as the fear of the plague fades, the rodents return. Beware the rats. What is astounding about Camus’ novel is the use of facts, the counting of the dead, and the utter banality of the pestilence. “The truth is that nothing is less sensational than pestilence, and by reason of their very duration great misfortunes are monotonous.” First goes imagination, then goes memory.

I watched a YouTube video recently, in which a psychoanalyst said that during this time humans are regressing. He said that the virus has normalized paranoia and has literally scared the s--t out of us — hence our need to hoard toilet paper. We have lost our sense of control, our sense of the future, and therefore we have lost our sense of time. We are in isolation, stuck here forever, never ending, eternal. Usually, time passes from the past to the present to the future. And that future includes death, for all of us. No one wants to live forever. We just don’t want to die quite yet, not in this manner.

My daughter, who is in isolation in Montreal with her husband and their four-month-old daughter, sent me a Sylvia Plath poem called “Nick and the Candlestick.” It is about a pregnant mother who wanders like a miner through her cave-like house, carrying a candle, talking to her unborn child. It is perfect for our times, in that it recognizes the child to come, the future. Plath ends the poem by pushing away dread and praising the unborn child.

You are the baby in the barn.

The baby in the barn. The book as barn. Do we build fictions like barns, to protect ourselves from the unknown? In literature, in art, in photographs, film, in any art form that succeeds, there has to be a sense of movement, of life beyond the frame, of the story continuing after we close the book.

Also, art requires work. It isn’t a Twitter feed, or Instagram — rather than being fed, we must learn to feed ourselves. As we read the narrative of our own plague, in real time, we keep looking for what is to come. We want hope. We need it. We want to sustain a sense of time.

It can uplift, relax, transport or energize us. Live music, in particular, is exciting because anything can happen: it’s intimate; it’s urgent, and everyone in the room experiences and shares it together. United.

But what does a musician do when they don’t have an audience? And audiences when they can’t access live music? Here in our coronavirus self-isolation being able to share music is a gift.

The Toronto Symphony Orchestra has teamed up with the Toronto Star to offer an exclusive weekly Musical Moment — a new performance by one of the TSO’s musicians every week — a respite from the hard headlines and tough news we hear every day.

“Like the Toronto Star, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra is here to serve Torontonians throughout the GTA,” said its CEO, Matthew Loden. “We hope that this exclusive Toronto Star performance series serves as a hopeful musical tonic as readers review challenging but important headlines.”

Here’s how it works: the musician records themselves playing their instrument live at home, then sends their recording to TSO producers; as in the first performance by concertmaster Jonathan Crow, to be paired with the piano of Philip Chiu.

Pieces will be no longer than three minutes. And because they’re recorded at home, you’ll get new insight into each musician; a glimpse into their lives beyond the stage. Each week will offer up a new experience — as you would at a live performance, you never know what might happen. There’s an energy and an intimacy.

There are many couples at the TSO — maybe they’ll play together. Other family members, children perhaps, might join in somehow. Ensembles might record separately with each musician in their own home and then be joined together in production.

The new video will be posted each Thursday at thestar.com/musicalmoments; check in every week for music to unite the city.

Widely known as the theme from the Ken Burn’s Civil War documentary, “Ashokan Farewell” was written in 1982 by American folk musician Jay Ungar as a goodnight/farewell waltz, played at the end of the annual Ashokan Fiddle & Dance Camps run by Ungar and his wife. The tune, which Ungar describes as a “song of longing and loss,” felt very apt for these times.

Thompson and Chun thank him for allowing them to share this performance of his tune.

Married couple Steven Woomert, an associate principal trumpet player with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and Rachael Kerr, a pianist for the Canadian Opera Company, recently took to their instruments in tribute to Woomert’s father Barton in honour of Father’s Day.

Woomert and Kerr played two pieces: an excerpt from “Intrada” by Canadian composer Ruth Watson Henderson and an excerpt from the opera “Carmen.”

Henderson’s piece was commissioned by Barton in memory of his own father Raymond. Trumpets run in their family. Barton, who was given his first trumpet by his father, recently retired from the TSO after 32 years as Associate Principal Trumpet — the seat Steven Woomert now occupies.

After Monday, when they officially bade adieu to royal life, it’s time for champagne, caviar and a three-tier cake scrawled with, “Freedom!” The bash with their closest pals should also include a few symbolic nods to their new homeland, Canada. (Actually, scratch that because now I’m picturing Heather Dorak browbeating guests into doing Pilates on an itchy Hudson’s Bay blanket as George Clooney gets wasted on Molson Canadian and Oprah, already stinking of ketchup chips, demands the terrified chefs whip up a batch of Nanaimo bars for her flight home.)

The point is, Harry and Meghan are now liberated. Congratulations!

Your royal nightmare is over. Let the real dreaming begin.

Anyone who believes the young couple made a grave mistake by ditching the charmed life of his birth — and one she married into — need only watch a nine-second clip from Monday. It was Commonwealth Day, Harry and Meghan’s last pony show as departing senior royals. The narcoleptic event went down inside Westminster Abbey, though given the frostiness on display, it should’ve unfolded in the North Pole.

Harry and Meghan, looking resplendent, were already seated in the second row. But when Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, ambled toward their spots in the first row, months of reported feuds twisted into high-def focus. Meghan waved at Kate, sweetly, but was ignored like a dirty panhandler.

William and Kate then took their seats. And Meghan turned toward her husband to whisper.

What she said, I have no clue.

But I would not blame Meghan had she asked in a hush, “Harry, what is wrong with those two?”

After months in which a “falling out” between the brothers was widely reported, this was a chance for the couples to at least feign congeniality for the global cameras. You know? Pretend everything is A-OK. Hug it out. Fake laugh and make small talk. Do something to disabuse the world of the notion there is now bad blood between two blood brothers.

But that’s not what happened. And the blame goes to William and Kate, who telegraphed petulance.

My heart goes out to Harry and Meghan. It really does. Tired of the absolute garbage they’ve endured from the British tabloids — and determined to animate their own philanthropic and career goals without the controlling shackles of Buckingham Palace — they reasonably asked to become part-time royals.

Instead, they were stripped of their Sussex brand and banished from the Queendom.

Whether it was the awkward, chilly interaction with William and Kate on Monday or getting booed by a heckler at the Endeavour Fund Awards a couple of days earlier, Harry and Meghan’s final weekend as royals was not cause for any second-guessing — it was proof #Megxit was one of the greatest decisions ever made.

The royal family does not deserve Harry and Meghan. The world does.

The royal family wanted to hold them down. They are now free.

On Saturday, during an interview on MSNBC Live, British journalist Victoria Mather revealed the extent of the classist-slash-racist forces aligned against Markle when she blurted out, “I think what has really, really upset the British public is that Meghan Markle, who many people consider only, you know, five clicks up from trailer trash, has actually tried to disrespect the Queen. And the Queen is the most respected person — most respected woman — in the world.”

Now, if I were to be similarly nasty, I might point out Mather looks like Benedict Cumberbatch’s uncle in drag who works the overnight shift at a Twinings factory. Five clicks up from trailer trash? Mather looks and sounds three clicks below a stolen bangers-and-mash breakfast along the banks of the River Thames, in the company of Piccadilly Circus freaks.

But if you watch the rest of the interview, the narrative is clear: Kate Middleton came from a great family worthy of royalty. Meghan Markle, by contrast, was spawned from a biracial hillbilly clan, and has no right to yank Harry from his relationship with his king-in-waiting brother and preternaturally uptight sister-in-law.

So Meghan is basically the Yoko Ono of this century: blamed for the breakup of another “Fab Four.”

Give me a break. From the moment Markle was linked to Prince Harry, she has coped with vicious attacks on her character and motivation. And yet, at every turn, she has bravely smiled, put on her hiking boots and taken the high road. Her steely resolve, her focus on the big picture, reminds me of someone else: Princess Diana.

So Harry and Meghan’s final march through royal duty this weekend is no longer cause for debate: it is irrefutable evidence they made the right decision by getting the hell away. What they want for themselves, compared to what was expected of them, could never be reconciled. There was no middle ground here.

Harry and Meghan, after the birth of their son, realized royal life was a prison in the making.

Now they are free. Now there is no looking back.

When the Dixie Chicks triumphantly returned earlier this month, dropping a fist-up emoji of a song called “Gaslighter” — also the name of a long-awaited album, coming soon — my thoughts darted to a few places. One, I remembered how much I bloody love the Dixie Chicks.

Two, a reminder of the fuss that engulfed the game-changing country trio, back in the early aughts, when frontwoman Natalie Maines publicly denounced both the Iraq War and the then-president George W. Bush (and how quaint all of that sounds now).

Three, a fixation on the idea that while “Gaslighter’ has the ire and the tang of songs on their 2006 comeback album — think “Not Ready To Make Nice” — and that it, additionally, makes pulp of a term that is ubiquitous these days — “gaslighting” is an in-vogue word, employed everywhere from politics to reality TV — I was not entirely sure that what this song was about was actually … well … “gaslighting.” Maybe it’s just a bummer?

Indeed, visions of Alanis cascaded upon me, as I wondered if gaslight might just be the next “Ironic”? You remember, dontcha, that ’90s anthem which describes any number of things — “a traffic jam when you’re already late,” for one; “ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife,” for another — few of which were especially ironic?

Some background: “gaslighting” has become a more popular expression, in this Trump-era zeitgeist of “alternative facts” but in its purest essence, in the personal realm, it refers to a form of sustained emotional abuse that involves manipulating the truth to make someone doubt their grip on reality — and the term actually goes back decades. To a 1938 play “Gaslight,” in fact — one that later became a classic movie with Ingrid Bergman. In that plot, a husband wrecks havoc on his wife by subtly altering things, including playing with the gaslights in the house.

What do you think?

Lying. Manipulation. Keeping your victim foggy-eyed and off-balance. The toolbox of the classic gaslighter in that original incarnation. And one that has become a staple in psychology, and has now morphed into a go-to bit of invective in this era, it reaching its own sort of pop-political apotheosis when, in an interview last year, none other than Taylor Swift accused Trump of “gaslighting the American public.” Lately, I have heard everyone from Real Housewives to contestants on “Love Island” throw around the term.

The term has also been enjoying a good run on bookshelves, too, especially in a form of domestic noir as practised by authors like Gillian Flynn. There is, for instance, Tara Isabella Burton’s pretty great, gender-bending Talented Mr. Ripley redux from a couple of years ago, “Social Creature,” in which the anti-heroine uses gaslighting via the very 21st-century modes of social media. And also, even crazier, the meta-ness of A.J. Finn’s bestseller “The Woman in the Window” (soon to be a movie with Amy Adams), which was sold as a gaslight novel but then got even more curiouser, when the author was unveiled as a serial liar himself in a long profile done of him in “The New Yorker,” with his past deceptions including claiming to have had cancer, among other things (cue the allegations of Finn as a gaslighter by colleagues).

A Guardian columnist echoed some of my own reservations, though, when she warned against cheapening the term. “Put simply, all gaslighters are lying creeps, but not every lying creep is a gaslighter,” Barbara Ellen wrote. Meaning: it is not a convenient umbrella term for all mendacious behaviour, nor is it “gaslighting every single time someone lies, or makes excuses.”

When it occurs, “it is a systematic dissolving another person’s sense of self, until they’re questioning every move and instinct.” And not just a phenomenon that pops up on a show like “Love Island,” where male contestants are tagged as gaslighters, when — girl, please — many of them are just himbos who’d say anything to get laid.

So, what say you, Dixie Chicks? In their album — which the group has called “the most personal and autobiographical” — the just-out song clearly traces Maines’ very public divorce from a liar-face. And the full-blast lyrics? Well, they speak for themselves. Exhibit A: “Give you all my money, you’ll gladly walk away … Gaslighter, denier, doing anything to get your ass farther …”

It is an earworm, all right, but is, actually … gaslighting? Let the debates begin.",[],740,0.94788047929051

Others would say that it’s never gone away: disco has been an enduring influence on music — and pop culture more broadly — ever since producers and artists first integrated synthesizers and four on the floor beats into pop sounds in the late 1960s and early ’70s.

Wherever you fall in these debates about disco’s evergreen status, what cannot be disputed is the central place of the late American singer and songwriter Donna Summer in the history of the genre.

Performer and frequent co-writer of 14 Billboard Hot 100 top 10 hits — including “Hot Stuff,” “Bad Girls,” “Macarthur Park,” “Heaven Knows,” “Last Dance,” “Dim all the Lights” and more — Summer’s musical legacy is huge. And yet for many years Summer resisted her status as the so-called Queen of Disco, says theatre director Des McAnuff, “because she was so many other things.”

McAnuff is the director and co-writer of the Broadway musical “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical,” which is playing at the Princess of Wales Theatre through March 22. The premise of the show is that it takes place at a concert celebrating Summer’s music and then flashes back to retell the story of her life.

Three actors play Summer, as the senior Diva Donna (Dan’yelle Williamson), the career-prime Disco Donna (Alex Hairston) and the fledgling Duckling Donna (Olivia Elease Hardy).

“One of the themes is that she was many people,” says McAnuff. “She lived a number of different lives, some even contradictory.”

The show revisits Summer’s early professional years in Germany, where she met up with the producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, and put out the groundbreaking singles “Love to Love You Baby” and “I Feel Love.” In its survey of Summer’s career, it demonstrates the wide range of musical genres that influenced her and to which she contributed, including pop, funk, R&B, gospel and inspirational rock.

It also touches on some of the more controversial aspects of Summer’s life and career: a born-again Christian, she was quoted in the 1980s as saying that AIDS was divine retribution for immoral lifestyles, statements she denied but which caused great distress among her massive gay following.

The show reunites McAnuff, the Tony and Olivier Award winner and former artistic director of the Stratford Festival, with choreographer Sergio Trujillo. The pair have created several highly successful musicals built around the back catalogues of musical groups and artists, including “Jersey Boys,” about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, and “Ain’t Too Proud,” about The Temptations.

Both McAnuff and Trujillo, who live in the U.S., spent formative years in Canada and still identify partly as Canadian. Trujillo’s memories of the disco era are directly tied to Toronto.

“My family arrived in Canada in 1976 from Colombia,” says Trujillo. “I had never heard disco music before. I’d only heard salsa in Colombia. This whole new sound and style of music was electrifying to me. My cousins are older than me by five or six years and they were all really immersed in the disco craze. They would take me to various clubs around Toronto — I was 14 or 15 — and I watched them dance. I saw the music and the decadence of that world.”

The challenge that Trujillo gave himself with “Summer” was to do more than “dust off those old disco moves” (just to set expectations: no one does the Hustle in this show).

“I lived through this period,” says Trujillo. “I decided that I was going to take the opportunity to create some storytelling” through the way the musical numbers are staged.

A priority for Trujillo and McAnuff was to make the production a showcase for female performers, particularly female performers of colour. Besides the three Donnas, there is a chorus of 12 female dancers (and one male) who, in addition to performing Trujillo’s choreography, play various roles in the story, female and male.

This “creates a kind of androgyny that captures the time,” says McAnuff, “and uses extraordinary talents that have been relatively sidelined in our business … Sergio and I spend a lot of time in auditions and one of the thing that becomes clear is that there are many, many women who don’t get the opportunities they deserve in terms of roles.”

While he spent his high school years in Scarborough and launched his theatre career in Toronto, McAnuff’s memories of the disco era are firmly set in New York. “I was working at the Public Theater in those days. The disco beat permeated all kinds of genres of music,” recalls McAnuff. “I was very aware of it. I play music; you couldn’t play music without being influenced by it.”

While he was at the time the sort of artsy rebel “who considered anything north of 14th Street as uptown,” says McAnuff, he does remember going to Studio 54 in its heyday and hearing Summer’s “Macarthur Park” for the first time.

“That song was of course a big discovery,” he says, “and this is in the show. Before that people thought of Donna as a sort of Black Marilyn Monroe, but the fact that she could sing that way was something of a shock. She hadn’t really had the chance to show off those extraordinary pipes.”

“Summer” played on Broadway from April to December 2019 and earned two Tony nominations (for LaChanze as Diva Donna and Ariana DeBose as Disco Donna). This North American tour has been on the road since September 2019, and both McAnuff and Trujillo say they’re coming to Toronto to see the show here.

“I am excited that we are bringing it to the hometown where I fell in love with disco dance,” says Trujillo, “to be able to revisit that in the place where it all started for me. I hope audiences enjoy it and that they not only reminisce, but they leave dancing.”

Viewers who endured a train wreck of a “Bachelor” season had to put up with a fiasco of a finale, spread over four hours and two nights Monday and Tuesday, as pilot Peter Weber’s bid to find a wife crashed and burned.

To summarize: Peter claimed to be head over heels in love with one woman who said she loved him but that they were too different to make things work. Two days after she walked out on him, Peter claimed to be head over heels in love with another woman and proposed marriage to her. But the engagement ended because he still had feelings for the first woman, who confessed she still had feelings for him and agreed to give him a second chance.

Despite the optimistic presence of jeweller Neil Lane in Tuesday’s live studio audience in Los Angeles, briefcase of diamond rings in hand, there was no engagement.

A couple of clear villains emerged from the shambles: Weber himself and a tired series that prizes made-for-TV manipulation over the human connections it claims to value above all else.

There was also a clear hero: Hannah Ann Sluss, the 23-year-old we were all making fun of a couple of weeks ago for dotting her i’s with hearts, but who boldly and confidently stood up for herself and rejected Peter’s weaselly rationalizations after he sabotaged their engagement.

The third person involved in this mess, Madison Prewett, also 23, was coaxed back into Peter’s arms after “Bachelor” host Chris Harrison personally delivered the news of Peter’s broken engagement. This strikes me less as altruism than a desperate attempt to get Peter paired off and stave off criticism that the entire season was a colossal waste of time.

But Peter’s mother Barb very bluntly told Peter and Madison on Tuesday that their relationship is doomed to fail. While I think it was impolitic of her to sabotage her own son on live TV like that, I also think she’s probably right given her disdain for Madison (evidenced by the rude faces she made on camera every time Madison opened her mouth) and that of the rest of Peter’s family. How does a relationship that’s already on shakey ground withstand that kind of familial disapproval?

But let’s back up and retrace how we got to this sorry point.

Weber was never a popular choice as star of this “Bachelor” season, one that was marked by tedious sniping among the contestants and Peter’s seeming inability to form more than shallow connections with any of his would-be mates.

Madison, a foster parent recruiter from Auburn, Ala., was an early front-runner, but just before she, Peter and two other women jetted off to Australia for “fantasy suite” week, she told him she’d be hard pressed to continue dating him if he had sex with the other two on their overnight dates. Deeply religious, she was saving herself for marriage.

Peter, on the other hand, was renowned for his sexual prowess. His claim to fame, and likely the reason he was chosen as Bachelor, was that he had sex four times with “The Bachelorette” in a windmill fantasy suite. So to no one’s surprise, except maybe Madison’s, Peter confessed he’d been “intimate” (whether with one or both of the other women was never specified) and Madison bolted.

She did come back, but his indiscretion hung like a cloud over their relationship and she left him in the Australian outback, seemingly forever.

This is where Peter could have used his powers for good instead of evil.

Hannah Ann, a model from Knoxville, Tenn., adored Peter; his family adored Hannah Ann. (That clip we saw ad nauseam of Barb wailing at Peter, “Bring her home to us”? The “her” was Hannah Ann.) But Peter was obviously gaga for Madison. The day after the breakup he told Hannah Ann that despite her obvious devotion to him his heart was “being pulled in two different directions.”

The honourable thing to do would have been to send Hannah Ann home then and there. Instead he claimed the very next day that he’d found “true love” with her. “My heart chooses you forever,” he told a very surprised Hannah Ann before pulling out a pear-shaped diamond ring.

It’s the same ring Hannah Ann put back in his hand weeks later after Peter confessed he couldn’t give her his entire heart.

Onstage in the studio, Hannah Ann lambasted Peter for downplaying his feelings for Madison. “I had no idea what I was saying yes to. That’s called being blindsided,” she said. “If you would have sat me down and had an honest conversation you know that my instinct would have picked up on that you were not ready for a commitment with me …

“And that’s the most hurtful part is that you didn’t respect me enough just to have that open conversation with me.”

She left him with this zinger: “If you want to be with a woman you’ve got to become a real man.”

Peter apologized a lot but never really explained why he did what he did. Was it pride? FOMO? A desire to please his family? A sense of pressure not to leave the show still single?

Whatever the reason, his actions did nothing to endear him to viewers who were already very displeased with him. And it’s hard to feel unreserved enthusiasm for his and Madison’s relationship given his shoddy treatment of Hannah Ann.

This is the third season in a row of “The Bachelor” to finish without a so-called happy ending. Arie Luyendyk Jr. dumped his fiancée for his runner-up; Colton Underwood got jilted by his favourite but got her to agree to continue dating him; and now this.

But maybe the issue isn’t the show’s failure rate but the whole premise that a man getting down on one knee to propose to a woman he’s known for barely two months is the pinnacle of romantic love.

Warner Bros. and ABC remain unbowed. They’re debuting yet another “Bachelor” spinoff on April 13, “Listen to Your Heart,” in which the contestants are all musicians, to be followed by a new season of “The Bachelorette” on May 18 starring Clare Crawley, the oldest franchise star at 38.

Organizers said Tuesday that they are pushing forward with plans for its 77th instalment, which will include a slightly reduced number of films in the main competition as well as some outdoor and virtual screenings. If the schedule stays intact, it will be the first major film festival since COVID-19 essentially shut down the industry in mid-March.

Festival director Alberto Barbera said in a statement that he is “extremely pleased that the Biennale Cinema can be held with a minimum reduction of films and sections” and that “a significant number of directors and actors will accompany films to the Lido.”

There will still be 50 to 55 films in the official selection, which will be announced on July 28, and screenings will take place in the traditional venues as well as two outdoor arenas (at the Giardini della Biennale and a skating rink on the Lido) with adopted safety measures established by authorities.

The festival will take its Virtual Reality section online and this year forego its Sconfini section, which hosts smaller films and genre fare, to accommodate more socially distanced screenings of the major films in competition. Actress Cate Blanchett is presiding over the main competition jury.

Travel to Italy, an early epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, is allowed from European countries. The European Union last week said it would reopen its border to 14 nations, but most Americans have been refused entry due to soaring coronavirus infections in the U.S. Press from countries with travel restrictions will be able to view press conferences virtually, Barbera said.

“Without forgetting the countless victims of these past few months to whom due tribute shall be paid, the first international festival following the forced interruption dictated by the pandemic becomes the meaningful celebration of the re—opening we all looked forward to, and a message of concrete optimism for the entire world of cinema which has suffered greatly from this crisis,” Barbera said.

The Toronto International Film Festival, which is typically held on the heels of Venice in September, has already announced plans for a smaller 2020 version, with fewer films and virtual red carpets. Both festivals serve as major launching grounds for awards hopefuls, although no one know how exactly it will work now that runway to the Oscars has been extended by two months.

He was 91.

Morricone’s longtime lawyer, Giorgio Assumma, said “the Maestro,” as he was known, died in a Rome hospital of complications following surgery after a recent fall in which he broke a leg bone.

Outside the hospital, Assumma read a farewell message from Morricone.

“I am Ennio Morricone, and I am dead,” began the message. In the greeting, the composer went on to explain that the only reason he was saying goodbye this way and had requested a private funeral was: “I don’t want to bother anyone.”

During a career that spanned decades and earned him an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Morricone collaborated with some of Hollywood’s and Italy’s top directors, including on “The Untouchables” by Brian de Palma, “The Hateful Eight” by Quentin Tarantino , “The Battle of Algiers” by Gillo Pontecorvo and “Nuovo Cinema Paradiso,” a nostalgic ode to the importance of movie houses in Italian small town life, by Giuseppe Tornatore.

The Tarantino film would win him the Oscar for best original score in 2016. In accepting that award, Morricone told the audience at the ceremony: “There is no great music without a great film that inspires it.”

In total, he produced more than 400 original scores for feature films.

His iconic so-called Spaghetti Western movies saw him work closely with the late Italian film director Sergio Leone, a former classmate.

Morricone practically reinvented music for Western genre movies through his partnership with Leone. Their partnership included the “Dollars” trilogy starring Clint Eastwood as a quick-shooting, lonesome gunman: “A Fistful of Dollars” in 1964, “For a Few Dollars More” in 1965 and “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” a year later.

Morricone was celebrated for crafting just a few notes — like the four notes played on a miniature pan flute favoured by a character in Leone’s 1984 movie “Once Upon A Time in America” — that would instantly become a film’s highly memorable motif.

That movie is a saga about Jewish gangsters in New York that explores themes of friendship, lost love and the passing of time, starring Robert De Niro and James Woods. It is considered by some to be Leone’s masterpiece, thanks in part to Morricone’s evocative score, including a lush section played on string instruments.

“Inspiration does not exist,” Morricone said in a 2004 interview with The Associated Press. “What exists is an idea, a minimal idea that the composer develops at the desk, and that small idea becomes something important.”

In a later interview, with Italian state TV, Morricone cited “study, discipline and curiosity” as the keys to his creative genius. “Writing music, like all creative arts, comes from a long path” along life’s experiences, he said.

“A great phenomenon of world music” was how Italian film director Dario Argento described Morricone, who scored five of his films.

In his late 80s, Morricone provided the score for “The Hateful Eight,” Tarantino’s 2015 70-mm epic and the first time in decades that he had composed new music for a Western. It was also the first time Tarantino had used an original score.

In accepting Morricone’s Golden Globe for the music in his place, Tarantino called him his favourite composer.

“When I say ‘favourite composer,’ I don’t mean movie composer. ... I’m talking about Mozart, I’m talking about Beethoven, I’m talking about Schubert,” Tarantino said.

Italy’s head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, in a condolence message to the composer’s family, wrote: “Both a refined and popular musician, he left a deep footprint on the musical history of the second half of the 1900s.”

Morricone’s sound tracks, Mattarella said, “contributed greatly to spreading and reinforcing the prestige of Italy in the world.”

Morricone’s style was sparse, made of memorable tunes and unusual instruments and arrangements, and often stirred deep emotions.

His music punctuated the long silences typical of the Spaghetti Westerns, with the characters locked in close-ups, staring at each other and waiting for their next moves. The coyote howl, harmonicas and eerie whistling of “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” became Morricone’s trademark and one of the most easily recognizable soundtracks in cinema.

Minutes before handing Morricone the Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Eastwood recalled hearing for the first time the score of “A Fistful of Dollars” and thinking: “What actor wouldn’t want to ride into town with that kind of music playing behind him?”

It was a night to remember for Morricone, who had been nominated for Oscars five times (“The Hateful Eight” was his sixth) but until then had never won.

Born in Rome on Nov. 10, 1928, Morricone was the oldest of the five children. His father was a trumpet player.

After studying trumpet and composition at the Conservatory of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in the Italian capital, he started working as a trumpeter and then as an arranger for record companies.

“I started working on very easy kinds of music pieces for the radio, for television and then for the theatre, and then little by little I started to compose the film scores,” he told the AP in 2016.

In 1961 he wrote his first score for a movie, a bittersweet comedy set in the final moments of Fascism called “Il Federale” (known in English as “The Fascist”). That decade also saw Morricone co-operate with Pontecorvo, first on “The Battle of Algiers,” the black-and-white classic depicting the Algerian uprising against the French; and later on “Queimada,” a tale of colonialism starring Marlon Brando.

Morricone received his first Oscar nomination for original score with “Days Of Heaven,” a 1978 movie by U.S. director Terence Malick. Beside “The Hateful Eight,” the others were for “The Mission” (1986), “The Untouchables” (1987), “Bugsy” (1991) and “Malena” (2000).

Shortly before his lifetime Oscar, Morricone joked that he would have been happy without the coveted statuette, saying “I would have remained in the company of illustrious non-winners.”

But he also made no secret that he thought “The Mission,” with its memorably sweet theme of “Gabriel’s Oboe,” deserved the Academy Award. That year, he lost to Herbie Hancock’s “Round Midnight.”

Morricone had recently composed music to be performed in Genoa’s Carlo Felice Theater later this summer in honour of the 43 victims of that city’s 2018 Morandi Bridge collapse, Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci said. The music will be performed on the eve of a ceremony inaugurating the bridge’s replacement, the mayor said.

Highly versatile, Morricone also orchestrated Italian pop tunes that include enduring classics, like one version of an eternal summer hit, “Sapore di Sale” (“Taste of Salt”), which was written by famed Italian troubadour Gino Paoli.

Another renowned maestro, Riccardo Muti, cited his “friendship and admiration? for Morricone. Muti on Monday recalled that when he directed the composer’s piece “Voci dal Silenzio” (Voices from the Silence” ) the work elicited “true emotion” from the audience, both in Chicago, where Muti directs the symphony orchestra, as well as during a performance in Ravenna, Italy.

Muti called Morricone an “extraordinary” composer both for films and in classical music.

Asked by Italian state TV a few years ago if there was one director he would have liked to have worked with but didn’t, Morricone said Stanley Kubrick had asked him to work on “A Clockwork Orange.” But that collaboration didn’t happen because of a commitment to Leone, Morricone recalled.

Morricone is survived by his wife Maria Travia, whom he cited when accepting his 2016 Oscar. Married in 1956, the couple had four children, Marco, Alessandra, Andrea and Giovanni.

As in other journeys toward recognition, equality and freedom to be, the world has come far, and not far enough. And as always, there are arguments about which way to go.

June may be over. But television goes on, and we would like to propose some recent relevant series to keep the party going. One caveat: Not all that follows constitutes a party.

‘Pose-a-Thon’

Mostly a party is the isolation-shot “Pose-a-Thon,” a fundraising special featuring the cast and creators from the FX ballroom drama “Pose” that dropped on the eve of the Stonewall anniversary weekend. Offering songs and stories and testimonials, with a brief history of Stonewall from showrunner Steven Canals, the show makes a point of declaring that the “queer liberation movement was begun by black and brown trans women,” the very people at the heart of “Pose.”

‘Visible: Out on Television’

TV has indeed made progress in the intervening years, if stumbling along the way. Last year brought a same-sex marriage on the PBS cartoon “Arthur,” while the May series finale of Netflix’s “She-Ra and the Princess of Power” made explicit what fans already understood, that it was a long arc lesbian love story. The five-part documentary “Visible: Out on Television,” which premiered on Apple TV Plus in March, reaches back to the earliest days of the medium and gives a pretty thorough account of how LGBTQ people have been portrayed and employed across the decades — from invisibility to subjects of (invariably misguided) analysis, to objects of censure and pity and low comedy, to fodder for concerned social comment and big drama.

A running theme of “Visible” is that we should look for ourselves reflected in popular culture, how what we find or fail to find changes us and how in the absence of real representation, we look for what we can adapt and use. LGBTQ characters have moved from guest shots to supporting parts to central roles — to being played, in the bargain, by performers whose identity matches the character’s — as queerness has become something not always worth comment in and of itself. This too raises issues in a still imperfect world — as Times TV editor Matt Brennan pointed out in his piece on the series, the arc toward justice will require more bending.

‘Disclosure’

“Visible” pairs well with (and overlaps) “Disclosure,” a Netflix documentary specifically about trans actors and images, directed by Sam Feder and narrated and featuring “Orange Is the New Black” superstar Laverne Cox. Its view is less historical — though it supplies ample context, back to silent film — than it is concerned with the present and immediate future. Autobiographical, philosophical and political at heart, “Visible” and its contributors are erudite, articulate and disinclined to simplify.

‘Welcome to Chechnya’

HBO has put up a pair of documentaries that demonstrate in different ways the effects of homophobia. The just-premiered, ironically titled “Welcome to Chechnya” is an on-the-ground documentary shot in 2017, when authorities in the Russian Federation republic waged war on its LGBTQ population. They carried out what has been described as a “purge” — allegedly making arrests, torturing citizens to name other citizens, encouraging “honour” killings and generally trying to will difference out of existence. It feels shockingly medieval. The film, directed by David France, focuses on a group of underground activists smuggling refugees through halfway houses and out of Russia to countries willing to take them. It has all the elements of a classic escape film and is often difficult to watch, both for the subject matter and cinematic tension. But it is not without hope.

‘Bully. Coward. Victim. The Story of Roy Cohn’

Seven minutes into the first episode of “Visible,” legal attack dog Roy Cohn turns up next to U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy at the televised Army-McCarthy hearings, which, among other things, targeted LGBTQ people as security risks during the so-called Lavender Scare. Broadcast to an audience of some 80 million over its run, the hearings introduced the fact of homosexuality to television and, one would suppose, to much of America. Cohn is never heard from, or, for that matter, talked about, in “Visible,” but HBO’s excellent “Bully. Coward. Victim. The Story of Roy Cohn” discusses him at feature length.

The film takes its title from a panel in the AIDS memorial quilt that director Ivy Meeropol and her father happened upon. It was a moment of particular significance for them, as Meeropol is the granddaughter of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, whom Cohn helped send to the electric chair; he also was, significantly, a closeted gay man, who would die of AIDS complications. A high-living social climber who made it a point of honour to pay as few bills as possible, and no taxes, Cohn was a mentor to Donald Trump, if that word may be used in such a negative context, and an attorney for various organized crime figures.

Cohn died in 1986, and Meeropol’s film offers a picture of a gone world — a time when gay culture was influencing the mainstream, without the mainstream quite recognizing that fact. (Cohn was a regular in gay-friendly Provincetown, Mass., and at Studio 54.) Given the Rosenberg connection, “The Story of Roy Cohn” is remarkably even-handed, nearly sympathetic and more than a little sad. Cohn may have been a villain, but he was a victim not only of HIV but also of his generation. In hiding his sexuality, even as he was dying, his case was little different from that of actor Rock Hudson, who died of AIDS complications a year before Cohn. Both were 59.

‘Hollywood’/‘Now Apocalypse’

A fictionalized young Hudson, played by Jake Picking, is a central character in Ryan Murphy’s Netflix miniseries “Hollywood.” It’s an alternative-history postwar fantasy in which fear of a gay Hollywood is overcome as early as 1947, giving Rock the happy beginning, and we assume the ending life denied him — or he denied himself in life. It is a weird mess of a show that works best taken not quite as seriously as it wants to be. But it works as a kind of camp art film — something along the lines of Gregg Araki’s exuberant, future-camp, polysexual, porn-adjacent sci-fi farce “Now Apocalypse,” a Hollywood fable of a different sort. Starz sent it into the world last year. But the glossy, madcap first season is still available to stream, and worth seeking out.

‘A Secret Love’

For a lovely documentary take on the theme, see “A Secret Love,” which debuted on Netflix in April. It tells the story of Pat Henschel and Terry Donahue, a lesbian couple who didn’t reveal the nature of their relationship until they were in their 80s. Made by a family member, Chris Bolan, it’s moving not only for its somewhat reluctant, matter of fact intimacy but also for its sweep. The film takes in their younger lives with photos and home movies that capture a full domestic, romantic and social life in a time when exposure might mean ruin, even imprisonment. That Donahue was a member of the all-American Girls Professional Baseball League, the one pictured in “A League of Their Own,” is a historical bonus.

He was 67.

The news was confirmed by his friend, actress Liliana Greenfield-Sanders, and others on social media. “He was the funniest person on the planet,” she wrote. “I will miss him terribly.”

The Los Angeles native was born in 1952 and graduated from the American Film Institute in 1975. After working with Anne Bancroft on two projects at AFI, he was introduced to her husband, Mel Brooks, and became his assistant on the 1977 film “High Anxiety.”

Cornfeld went on to work with the couple on several more projects and got his first executive producing credit on Brooks’ 1980 film “The Elephant Man.”

In the early days of his career, he produced “National Lampoon’s European Vacation” (1985), David Cronenberg’s “The Fly” (1986), Steven Soderbergh’s “Kafka” (1991) and Guillermo Del Toro’s “Mimic” (1997). He also had bit parts in several movies including “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” in which he played the Pirate King of Captain Hook Fish ’n’ Chips.

In 1999 he teamed with Stiller to launch Red Hour Films, under which they enjoyed success with the comedies “Zoolander” (2001), “Duplex” (2003), “Starsky & Hutch” (2004), “Dodgeball” (2004), “Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny” (2006), “Blades of Glory” (2007) and “Tropic Thunder” (2008), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Robert Downey Jr. and won best comedy at the Broadcast Critics Film Awards and the Hollywood Film Awards.

“A really great person left the planet today,” Stiller said on Twitter. “Stuart Cornfeld ... was my friend, producing partner and creative confidant. He knew movies, made movies and loved movies. World = less better without him.”

Toward the end of his career, Cornfeld produced Jack Black’s 2017 film “The Polka King” and did some work in television. He was awarded the Franklin J. Schaffner Alumni Medal by AFI in 2013 and most recently produced the documentary “Have a Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics” for Netflix.

Scott',2020-07-03 00:00:00,"The opening scenes of the filmed version of the Broadway musical “Hamilton,” which started streaming on Disney Plus on Friday, pull you back in time to two distinct periods.

The people onstage, in their breeches and brass-buttoned coats, belong to the New York of 1776. That is when a 19-year-old freshly arrived from the Caribbean — the “bastard, immigrant, son of a whore” who shares his name with the show — makes his move and takes his shot, joining up with a squad of anti-British revolutionaries and eventually finding his way to George Washington’s right hand and the front of the $10 bill.

But this Hamilton, played with relentless energy and sly charm by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the music, book and lyrics, also belongs to the New York of 2016. Filmed (by the show’s director, Thomas Kail, and cinematographer Declan Quinn) in front of a live audience at the Richard Rodgers Theater in June of that year, the movie, while not strictly speaking a documentary, is nonetheless a document of its moment. It evokes a swirl of ideas, debates, dreams and assumptions that can feel, in the present moment, as elusive as the intrigue and ideological sparring of the late 1700s.

“Hamilton” may be the supreme artistic expression of an Obama-era ideal of progressive, multicultural patriotism.

Casting Black and Latino actors as the Founding Fathers and their allies was much more than a gesture of inclusiveness. The show’s argument, woven through songs that brilliantly synthesized hip hop, show tunes and every flavour of pop, was that American history is an open book. Any of us should be able to write ourselves into it.

Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the Treasury and an architect of the U.S. banking system, was Miranda’s chosen embodiment of this belief: an outsider with no money and scant connections who propelled himself into the centre of the national narrative through sheer brains, talent and drive. Miranda shares some of his hero’s ambition and intelligence, and turns Hamilton into an avatar of modern American aspiration.

“Hamilton” is a brilliant feat of historical imagination, which isn’t the same as a history lesson. Miranda used Ron Chernow’s dad-lit doorstop the way Shakespeare drew on Holinshed’s Chronicles — as a treasure trove of character, anecdote and dramatic raw material. One of the marvels of the show is the way it brings long-dead, legend-shrouded people to vivid and sympathetic life. The close-ups and camera movements in this version enhance the charisma of the performers, adding a dimension of intimacy that compensates for the lost electricity of the live theatrical experience.

The glib, dandyish Thomas Jefferson (Daveed Diggs) is a perfect foil for Hamilton: his rival, his intellectual equal and his sometimes reluctant partner in the construction of a new political order. The duplicitous Aaron Burr (Leslie Odom Jr.) may be the most Shakespearean figure in the pageant, a gifted man tormented and ultimately undone by his failure to make himself matter.

Not that public affairs are the only forces that move “Hamilton.” I haven’t forgotten the Schuyler sisters, who have some of the best numbers and who somewhat undermine the patriarchal, great-man tendencies inherent in this kind of undertaking. Angelica Schuyler (the magnificent Renée Elise Goldsberry), the oldest of the three sisters, is a freethinker and a feminist constrained by the narrowness of the options available to women of her time and class. Her sister Eliza (Phillipa Soo), who marries Alexander, is saved from being reduced to a passive, suffering figure by the emotional richness of her songs.

Still, the personal and the political don’t entirely balance. The biographical details are necessary to the structure and texture of the show, but it is fuelled by cabinet debates and pamphlet wars, by high rhetoric and backroom dealing, by the glory and complexity of self-government.

“Hamilton” is motivated, above all, by a faith in the self-correcting potential of the American experiment, by the old and noble idea that a usable past — and therefore a more perfect future — can be fashioned from a record that bristles with violence, injustice and contradiction. The optimism of this vision, filtered through a sensibility as generous as Miranda’s, is inspiring.

It is also heartbreaking. One lesson that the past few years should have taught — or reconfirmed — is that there aren’t any good old days. We can’t go back to 1789 or 2016 or any other year to escape from the failures that plague us now. This four-year-old performance of “Hamilton,” viewed without nostalgia, feels more vital, more challenging than ever.

In the fall of 1982, William Catterson, a New Jersey father of two, failed to return home from his fast-food job. His car was found, abandoned. A chocolate cake, an anniversary present for his wife, still rested on the passenger seat. Two years later, writer and producer Terry Dunn Meurer included his case in an HBO documentary: “Missing Persons: Four True Stories.” Catterson, who had faked his own disappearance, saw it. He turned himself in to police, then reunited with his family.

“And I was like, ‘Wow, that’s interesting,’” Meurer said. She and her producing partner, John Cosgrove, began to imagine a series that would not only televise have-you-seen-this-person enigmas and criminological riddles but maybe also crack them, too.

“Unsolved Mysteries” debuted on NBC in 1988 as part of a late-’80s tabloid TV boom and endured for decades on various networks and cable channels.

It had murders and missing persons. Also ghosts, Bigfoot and assorted UFOs. A cadaverous Robert Stack hosted. Eerie theme music gave even hardened viewers the heebie-jeebies. A pick-and-mix format alternated melodramatic crime stories and supernatural thrillers, arguably presaging both pulpy newsmagazines like “Dateline” and paranoid dramas like “The X-Files.”

Now Netflix has brought it back. The new “Unsolved Mysteries,” which reunites much of the original creative team, debuted Wednesday with a six-episode batch, to be followed by at least six more instalments later this year. It arrives in an America it anticipated: a crime-obsessed, conspiracy-minded nation with increasingly subjective notions about truth.

The format has changed, but the blend of fact and folklore remains. It is a combination that risks trivializing actual crimes by juxtaposing them with wilder content and legitimizing the uncanny through proximity to fact. Not that the creators see it that way.

“We like the mix,” Meurer said brightly. “We’ve always thought of ourselves as a mystery show, not as a true-crime show.”

From the beginning, competing impulses powered “Unsolved Mysteries”: a crusading compulsion to seek justice and a market-driven need to entertain. The show leaned heavily on reliable tabloid conventions — lost loves, missing heirs, unexplained deaths, medical mysteries — and many of the segments varied first-person interviews with best-guess re-enactments, some of them lurid. Paranormal cases and alternate histories made the counterfactual (a conspiracy theory about Martin Luther King Jr.’s death, Bigfoot) into just another puzzle.

“We just came up with every single type of mystery that we could think of: UFO, paranormal, ghost stories, miracles, past lives, psychics,” Meurer said. “We just mixed it all in with the crime.”

On NBC, “Unsolved Mysteries” began with a disclaimer: “This program is about unsolved mysteries. Whenever possible, the actual family members and police officials have participated in recreating the events. What you are about to see is not a news broadcast.”

So it was not news. Not exactly. But as crowdsourced detection, the series worked.

In the ’80s and ’90s, as an episode aired, viewer tips would pour into the show’s call centre. Of the solvable mysteries — a missing child, say, or unidentified remains — the show counts more than 260 as resolved, a clearance rate of about 34 per cent. (“Bigfoot isn’t necessarily solvable,” Meurer said.) Some of those solutions came via viewer tips. After a Friday night broadcast in 1988 about fugitives Missy Munday and Jerry Strickland, a flood of calls had already led to their arrest by Saturday morning.

After nine seasons on NBC, the show moved to CBS, then to Lifetime in an attenuated form, then to Spike, which repackaged old episodes and added Dennis Farina as a tan, tough-guy narrator. The Spike stint ended in 2010, but “Unsolved Mysteries” did not disappear. Its website and cold case forums remained open. Old episodes popped up, unofficially and then officially, on YouTube. Amazon began streaming them in 2017.

Meurer never gave up on a revival. “There’s always mysteries that need to be solved,” she said. When the hit Netflix drama “Stranger Things” premiered in 2016, she noticed tweets and Facebook posts comparing that scripted series, which is set in the ’80s and goes big on the paranormal, to “Unsolved Mysteries.” So she brought a pitch to its producers at 21 Laps Entertainment.

Shawn Levy, who founded 21 Laps, had watched the original “Unsolved Mysteries” in college, admiring the way it meshed genre mystery with character-driven story. “There’s a finite number of true iconic brands in the world, especially in the world of storytelling,” he said. “‘Unsolved Mysteries’ is a true icon.” (He also called it “the Holy Grail of IP.”) Levy, whose company has a deal with Netflix, came on as an executive producer, as did Josh Barry, president of 21 Laps.

Levy wanted to honour what he called the “DNA” of the original show, though longtime viewers will immediately recognize changes. Feeling that Stack, who died in 2003, was irreplaceable, producers omitted a host. Gone, too, is the party-platter format of the ’80s and ’90s, in which calamity followed calamity, separated only by commercial breaks. Now each episode, which runs 50 minutes, give or take, centres on a single mystery. There are no commercials.

These episodes — three unexplained deaths, one missing person, one wanted man, one paranormal phenomenon — move closer to traditional documentary, with fewer re-enactments and a greater emphasis on interviews and archival sources. The show assumes a somewhat more sophisticated viewer with a far longer attention span. One episode — a family annihilation chiller — is presented almost entirely in French, with English subtitles.

And the producers hope that a platform like Netflix, with its global reach and its more than 180 million subscribers, many of them now homebound, may lead to more solutions.

“The reach is so wide,” said Marcus A. Clarke, who directed several episodes of the new version.

That reach prodded Angel Rivera to participate in the first episode, “Mystery on the Rooftop.” In 2006, his brother, Rey Rivera, went missing. His body was found a week later in the conference room of a Baltimore hotel. A murder or a suicide? The medical examiner could not say.

“It’s not something that I ever readily shared with anyone,” Angel Rivera said. But he trusted the producers and described the interviews that Clarke had conducted as therapeutic.

“There was a sense of peace doing it,” he said. And the show, he believes, might prompt someone to come forward with information.

“We’ll get it out to more ears and eyes than we could ever possibly imagined,” he said. “For my parents, even for me, there’s that closure that we’re all looking for.”

Rivera did not mind that the same viewers who will scrutinize his brother’s death can also watch “Berkshires UFO,” an episode about close encounters in the Berkshire mountains in 1969. “I think it falls in line with what the brand is about,” he said.

In 2020, when politicians knowingly circulate alternative facts and conspiracy theories trend on TikTok, what does it mean for that brand to take a flexible approach to observable reality? “Unsolved Mysteries” did not create this fungible, disingenuous moment. But a show that puts aliens on the same epistemological footing as a murdered family does meet it.

This is not necessarily an act of bad faith — Meurer absolutely believes in the paranormal. “I’ve always felt that way, my whole life,” she said. And Clarke, who directed “Berkshires,” is a UFO enthusiast. He mentioned the Times’ reporting on the Pentagon’s recent release of three videos, filmed by Navy pilots, that show unidentified aerial phenomena.

“If at this point people don’t believe or understand that these things are real, they are in denial,” he said.

Levy, who described himself as “slightly to the skeptical end of that sliding scale,” enjoyed “Berkshires UFO.” But when pushed, he said he felt less certain about the show’s accommodating approach to the supernatural. “That is something that needs to be considered moving forward,” he said.

Another potential problem, for viewers if not necessarily the producers, is the show’s relationship with law enforcement. Cops were not necessarily the series’ heroes. After all, if a case made its way to “Unsolved Mysteries,” police had probably failed in some way.

But agencies have historically suggested mysteries to the show’s producers and sent officers to vet tips. Like the recently cancelled “Cops,” the series makes an implicit argument for law and order with its envisioning of a dangerous, anarchic world.

“We’ve always had a great reputation with law enforcement,” Meurer said.

Still, an episode in this new series, “No Ride Home,” explores a botched police investigation into what may have been a racially motivated crime. In 2004, Alonzo Brooks, a young Black man, disappeared after attending a party. After a police search failed, a search led by friends and family located his body.

A cause of death was not determined. In June, spurred by inquiries from “Unsolved Mysteries,” the FBI reopened his case, offering a $100,000 (U.S.) reward.

“We’ve been seeing a lot of people being kind of brought to justice from old cases and this is one that really deserves it,” Clarke said. “The family deserves it.”

Cynthia Bowles, a longtime story producer, thinks that the Brooks case could be solved. She also feels hopeful about the murder of Patrice Endres (the subject of the episode “13 Minutes”) and the disappearance of Lena Chapin (“Missing Witness”).

“They could all shake loose,” she said.

Ethical complications will not matter so much if the right tips come. If Brooks’ family — or Rivera’s or Endres’ or Chapin’s — gets answers, who will care about wiggly truth value or an outlook that sees the world through a camera lens, darkly?

“‘Unsolved Mysteries’ has always represented hope,” Meurer said. “That’s why we do the show: the hope is that we’re going to solve these cases.

“To me,” she added, “that mitigates the darkness.”

But the internet contains some proper gems that get more interesting the longer you watch, all easily searchable on YouTube or other sites as indicated.

Diane Dufresne: Symphonique n’ Roll at the Colisée de Québec (1988)

It’s a crying shame that the rest of Canada doesn’t know Quebec’s reigning art-rock diva of the 1980s and ’90s, but this is probably because Dufresne never bothered with the Anglo markets. Before Bjork’s swan, Madonna’s Gaultier cones and Lady Gaga’s meat dress, there was Diane Dufresne and … any number of spectacular dresses, featured in several concerts now available on YouTube. In Symphonique n’ Roll, Dufresne sings symphonic arrangements of her synth hits and, at one point, wears a dress train with wheels covered in musical instruments, with a violin on her head. But the outfits are the least of it: the punk attitude, the hysteria, the ownership of the text, the unfailing musical instincts and the tongue-in-cheek moments all make for an exciting spectacle. Follow along with the lyrics if possible: her knack for turning them into dramatic monologues is something to behold. There’s also a Mahler song and a Verdi aria in the program, and she shines in both.

Julie Andrews Sings Her Favorite Songs (1989)

“You could say my mom was a bit of a stage mom,” says Andrews as she introduces Noel Coward’s “Mrs. Worthington,” and interrupts the singing with memories of performing with her mother’s and stepfather’s double act. The embodiment of all that is good manners and polish, Andrews started off on the wrong side of the tracks, entertainment-wise: music hall stages in the small towns of England. She loved every moment of it, she recollects, especially the short lady by the name of Ella Shields who was a male impersonator and who would dress up as an elegant bum for “Burlington Bertie from Bow.” Which Andrews proceeds to sing (and dance) herself. There is a risqué and elaborately set up #MeToo joke a quarter of an hour later, a hot rendition of “Le Jazz Hot” from “Victor/Victoria” and a lot more lanky dancing before she changes into a silver gown for the only sedate portion of the evening. Unlike most of her movies, this is not family-friendly and so much better for it.

La Traviata

There’s an intriguing recent Paris Opera staging of this Verdi opera available at Medici.tv, free with a Toronto Public Library card. Fronted by the charismatic South African soprano Pretty Yende, the production sets the Verdi-Dumas classic in the present time, with Violetta Valéry as an Instagram influencer, girl-about-town famous for being famous, both feted and owned by her followers in that unique way that social media celebrities are. By way of video projections, there are status updates and photo uploads happening seemingly in real time throughout the opera. In the final act, when illness strikes, millions of virtual friends are reduced to a single one in flesh and blood. In at least two operatic classics, sopranos die due to respiratory illness (tuberculosis); it can’t be long before COVID-19 becomes a dramatic device in productions of “La Traviata” and “La Bohème”

For the Gen-X set

There are a lot of concerts for the discerning Gen-Xer online — after all, the concert as an art form was created as members of that generation were coming into youth culture. Pet Shop Boys’ Electric Tour (2013) is a fantastic hybrid of light projections and electronica, aptly directed for video. There’s New Order in Berlin (2012), geezers by now but still having it. The 1998 Depeche Mode Live in Cologne, recorded for MTV, shows Dave Gahan’s baritone at peak suavity. There’s also Arcade Fire Live at Lollapalooza in 2017; and Oasis in Manchester in 2005, before an insane number of people, as the 1990s’ last hurrah. But for the sheer propulsion, visceral onslaughts and brain food, these are two standouts: Eurythmics Live in Sydney from 1987 and the Jonathan Demme-directed recording of the Talking Heads’ Stop Making Sense, preserved on DVD and BluRay.

Laurie Anderson Home of the Brave (1986)

This is the young Laurie Anderson: playful and childlike as she moves between instruments and guest musicians, voice and sound modulation, recorded and live. No melancholy of “O Superman” here, nor the gravitas of “From the Air” — this is as carefree and fun as avant-garde song-making gets.

Mozart Great Mass in C minor

Insula Orchestra — named after the part of the brain that turns inchoate sensations into conscious emotions — is one of France’s several orchestras run by women conductors. Mozart’s “Mass in C-minor” was its first big statement to the world. An old church was opened for the purposes of this recording for the Arte TV network and four superb soloists hired. Period instruments are different from modern symphonic orchestras: sound comes across as smudgier and more in-between because they’re differently tuned and produced by different materials, gut strings not steel or nylon, and horns that come valveless, like bugles. In other words, the impression of precision and sharpness is harder to achieve, and Insula and the chorus do this — but observe the conductor, Laurence Equilbey. Hers is not a style of strict beat-tracking; it’s more of a trance from the first big tutti in Kyrie on. It’s a great pleasure to observe women owning such muscular and masculine works as Mahler’s 5th (see for example, Han-na Chang when she next guest-conducts the TSO) or Holst’s “The Planets” (Susanna Mälkki), but witnessing this kind of helplessness before the ineffability of music, as evinced by Equilbey, is a pleasure of a different, more poignant kind.

Then again, you might say that the seeds of Victor Feldbrill’s career as a conductor were sown even earlier, at a rehearsal of the Harbord Collegiate Orchestra, when the teacher-conductor handed his baton to his youthful concertmaster so the instructor could walk out front and listen to the orchestra.

The native Torontonian was a violinist then, as he was when Sir Ernest MacMillan subsequently handed him a baton to conduct the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in Strauss’s “Artist’s Life Waltz.”

The year was 1943, he was soon to be stationed in London with the Royal Canadian Navy (still as a violinist) and — following part-time studies at the Royal Academy and Royal College of Music — to return to postwar Toronto and a long professional life facing orchestras.

It is never easy to explain what makes a real conductor. When I was in university a popular textbook was Max Rudolf’s “The Grammar of Conducting” (I still own a copy). I later had the opportunity to hear Rudolf himself conduct in Cincinnati, thanked him and was promptly told that following the conducting diagrams in his book was the barest beginning.

He was right, of course. Two conductors can use those same diagrams and produce greatly different results.

On another occasion I asked a member of the TSO what he considered to be the role of a conductor and, with the cynicism born of long experience, he replied, “to not get in the way.”

Feldbrill did not get in the way. He knew what it was like to play in orchestras and knew better than to treat them without respect for their knowledge.

His own knowledge was acquired more on the front lines than academically. Conducting is something you learn by doing, and he started doing it regularly while still in school.

Did he become a great conductor? No, he became a valuable conductor, championing the work of Canadian composers more than any of his contemporaries did.

He knew the composers on a personal level, worked with them on their premieres and during his decade as music director of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra starting in 1958, he set a precedent that has sadly not been followed of making Canadian music a regular feature of his programming.

He did conduct internationally, mostly in England and Japan. In the latter country he became the first Canadian guest conductor at Tokyo’s National University of Art and Music in 1979. Throughout the 1980s he conducted and taught regularly in the Land of the Rising Sun.

It was back home in the true north, strong and free, that he made his mark, teaching and conducting at the University of Toronto and appearing with orchestras, both youth and professional, across the country.

His association with the TSO was particularly close, not only as a frequent guest but as sometime director of youth programming and founding conductor of the Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra.

Although he never became the orchestra’s music director — recognizing that he was too much the hometown boy to be considered for the job — he stepped up at a critical point in its history, following the 1973 death of Karel Ancerl, to act as resident conductor during the search for Ancerl’s successor.

I think it broke his heart when the then-manager of the orchestra finally terminated his annual appearances at Roy Thomson Hall. He last conducted a full concert at the age of 83.

Seven years later he was still conducting at an Arts and Letters Club celebration of his 90th birthday. I was one of the speakers at that occasion, remarking that critics and conductors have at least one thing in common: we tend to outlive everyone else.

Here’s what it has promised.,'Ben Sisario',2020-07-04 00:00:00,"What’s the fastest way to put music industry money into the hands of its Black creators? A small Swedish synthesizer manufacturer has a plan.

Teenage Engineering, which makes sleekly designed, retro-sounding machines adored by dance-music producers, will soon begin sharing sales revenue with a set of Black musicians and other artists of colour in the United States in recognition of their role in popularizing the company’s products.

“This is not charity,” Emmy Parker, the company’s chief brand officer, said in an interview. “Not only is it the right thing to do, it is also good for our business.”

The U.S.-wide soul-searching in the wake of George Floyd’s death has been felt with particular acuteness in the music industry, which owes much of its wealth to the work of Black artists but has just a handful of Black executives in the most senior jobs. Scrutiny has brought the business together in rare ways, with corporate rivals taking part in passionate discussions over Zoom and major companies promising to diversify their ranks.

Still, a thread of anger and impatience remains palpable behind the scenes.

“If history is any indicator, this blows over,” said Troy Carter, a longtime music and technology executive who is now an adviser to the Prince estate.

Despite some cynicism about the promises for change, the predominant mood is one of a momentum that must be seized. Almost as quickly as the major labels made big pledges in the past few weeks, an advocacy group, the Black Music Action Coalition, was formed to hold those companies to account.

“One of our main motivations is not to allow the record companies to get away with pledging money and not pledging systemic change,” said Prophet, a manager of Asian Doll, Layton Greene and other acts, who is part of the group. “Even though their foot was not on the neck of George Floyd, that same systemic racism that plagues society plagues the music business.”

Here’s where the industry’s responses currently stand.

Pledges from the major labels

On June 2, a campaign begun by two young Black women who work in music, Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang, paused the industry for a day of reflection and grew into an internet phenomenon under the hashtag #BlackoutTuesday.

Within days, a deluge of donation promises from major music companies followed. Warner — backed by a foundation connected to its parent company — and Sony each pledged $100 million (U.S.) to charity. Universal committed $25 million and established a task force to examine its operations. Spotify, Apple, YouTube and SiriusXM made further pledges.

In tacit acknowledgment of the industry’s poor record of hiring minorities for top positions, each of the big labels has undertaken employment inclusion efforts. Sony and Warner began searching for top diversity officers in recent weeks; Universal began its diversity push in 2017.

Universal is also a partner with the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the University of Southern California, which two years ago rocked the music world with a study finding scant representation of women in pop. Last week, the initiative said it would study the diversity of record labels, publishers, talent agencies, digital platforms and other companies.

“I think the findings will be shocking,” said Stacy L. Smith, an associate professor at USC who is the founder of the Annenberg initiative.

The term ‘urban’

One of the few concrete changes made so far has been contested. Three days after #BlackoutTuesday, Republic Records, a Universal label that is home to Drake and Ariana Grande, said it would stop using the word urban in department and job titles, calling it “outdated.”

That term, once used by radio stations to evoke sophistication, has come under fire as pigeonholing Black music and stunting the career growth of Black executives. Last month the Grammys renamed its urban contemporary album category “progressive R&B.”

Yet moves to retire “urban” have been called premature. Ethiopia Habtemariam, the president of Motown Records and a co-chair of Universal’s task force, said in an interview that addressing the word was not the task force’s first order of business. The greater goal, she said, was “to make sure we are creating a diverse environment at our company, making sure we have Black leadership across all of the industry. That’s the key.”

One complication: Many Black executives fully embrace the term, including Shawn Gee, the manager of the Roots, whose promotion company, Live Nation Urban, is a joint venture with the concert giant Live Nation Entertainment. The debate over “urban,” Gee said, is a distraction from the industry’s larger problem of a dearth of Black leaders.

“Who in these companies has been able to green light Black culture?” Gee said in an interview. “That’s where the real problem lies. The problem lies in the infrastructure, in the system — not in the word.”

Calls for Black leaders

One goal of the newly-formed Black Music Action Coalition — whose public letter was signed by artists including Pharrell Williams, Nicki Minaj, Travis Scott and Lady Gaga — was to address what it called “long-standing racial inequities in the music business.”

“There are not enough Black executives in the music business who have control of P&L,” said Binta Niambi Brown, a manager and executive who has worked with Chance the Rapper, referring to the profit and loss statements that measure a business’s finances. Brown, who is part of the coalition, added, “But they are required to explain Black culture to white executives who do run that.”

Carter, now of the Prince estate, became Spotify’s global head of creator services in 2016 — a high-ranking job covering all genres. But when he left two years later, Carter said, an Amazon executive offered him a job there as head of urban music.

“That is the bias that is automatically built into our business,” Carter said. “That if I am a Black executive, call me for the urban music job, which is completely unfair at the end of the day.”

An Amazon spokesperson denied Carter’s account, saying he “was never officially offered a role at Amazon.”

Looking back at old deals

Another question is the treatment of artist contracts from previous decades. Lisa A. Alter, a copyright lawyer who works on behalf of many older artists, said that in the past, Black artists routinely received poor contracts.

“Historically there was less robust representation of artists of colour from a legal point of view,” Alter said. “That resulted in an inability to get advice and negotiate strongly in certain areas — particularly the recoupment of advances and how royalties are calculated.”

Stories of poor contracts for older artists, particularly Black ones, are legion. Little Richard, for example, said that he waived his rights to many of his classic songs early in his career, though he regained them as part of a lawsuit settlement in the 1980s.

“I didn’t read my contracts right; I signed bad contracts,” he told the New York Times in a 1992 interview. “I paid dearly for it.”

One company, BMG Rights Management, a mid-size label and publishing group, has said it will review its past contracts to address “any inequities or anomalies.”

Yet the company’s pool of contracts is far shallower than that of any of the major labels, which have catalogues going back a century. BMG’s review also only covers its recording contracts, not those for music publishing, which are a majority of the company’s holdings.

In a statement, a Universal spokesperson said the company recognized “there is more work to be done” and is committed to looking into legacy contracts.

The Teenage Engineering plan

Compared to giant record companies and streaming platforms, Teenage Engineering is a tiny force. In 2018, it had about $11 million in net sales, according to its most recently disclosed financial statements.

But the company is positioning its revenue-sharing plan — which it is calling an artist fellowship — as a bold statement to recognize and quantify the contributions of artists of colour.

The program is set to begin Sept. 1, and Teenage Engineering’s contracts with artists are still being finalized. But Jesper Kouthoofd, its chief executive, said the company will pay at least 15 per cent of sales revenue to four acts when customers in the United States use special links to the company’s website. The four initial fellows are Underground Resistance, a long-running collective from Detroit; Suzi Analogue, from Miami; and VoltageCtrlR and Baseck, both of Los Angeles.

Other companies on music’s margins have drawn acclaim for their efforts to put more money in artists’ pockets. Bandcamp, an indie streaming and retail platform, has waived its fees on certain days during the pandemic. On Juneteenth, the site donated its share of sales to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

Parker, the company’s chief brand officer, declined to give specific terms of Teenage Engineering’s deals for the new program, but said the artists’ share of company revenues “could be anywhere from $100,000 a year to, in some cases, close to $1 million a year.”

“This will allow us,” Parker said, “to make a shift in the economic model immediately.”",[],1500,0.8685194111348788
248,https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2020/07/03/bob-dylan-has-a-lot-on-his-mind.html,10,music film perform artist play song art festiv,255,thestar,Bob Dylan has a lot on his mind,'Douglas Brinkley',2020-07-03 00:00:00,"A few years ago, sitting beneath shade trees in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., I had a two-hour discussion with Bob Dylan that touched on Malcolm X, the French Revolution, Franklin Roosevelt and World War II. At one juncture, he asked me what I knew about the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864. When I answered, “Not enough,” he got up from his folding chair, climbed into his tour bus, and came back five minutes later with photocopies describing how U.S. troops had butchered hundreds of peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho in southeastern Colorado.

Given the nature of our relationship, I felt comfortable reaching out to him in April after, in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, he unexpectedly released his epic, 17-minute song “Murder Most Foul,” about the Kennedy assassination. Even though he hadn’t done a major interview outside of his own website since winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016, he agreed to a phone chat from his Malibu home, which turned out to be his only interview before next Friday’s release of “Rough and Rowdy Ways,” his first album of original songs since “Tempest” in 2012.

Like most conversations with Dylan, “Rough and Rowdy Ways” covers complex territory: trances and hymns, defiant blues, love longings, comic juxtapositions, prankster wordplay, patriotic ardour, maverick steadfastness, lyrical Cubism, twilight-age reflections and spiritual contentment.

In the high-octane showstopper “Goodbye Jimmy Reed,” Dylan honours the Mississippi bluesman with dragon-fierce harmonica riffs and bawdy lyrics. In the slow blues “Crossing the Rubicon,” he feels “the bones beneath my skin” and considers his options before death: “Three miles north of purgatory — one step from the great beyond/I prayed to the cross and I kissed the girls and I crossed the Rubicon.”

“Mother of Muses” is a hymn to the natural world, gospel choirs and military men like William Tecumseh Sherman and George Patton, “who cleared the path for Presley to sing/who cleared the path for Martin Luther King.” And “Key West (Philosopher’s Pirate),” is an ethereal meditation on immortality set on a drive down Route 1 to the Florida Keys, with Donnie Herron’s accordion channelling the Band’s Garth Hudson. In it he pays homage to, “Ginsberg, Corso and Kerouac.”

Perhaps someday he’ll write a song or paint a picture to honour George Floyd. In the 1960s and 1970s, following the work of black leaders of the civil rights movement, Dylan also worked to expose the arrogance of white privilege and the viciousness of racial hatred in America through songs like “George Jackson,” “Only a Pawn in Their Game,” and “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll.” One of his most fierce lines about policing and race came in his 1976 ballad “Hurricane”: “In Paterson that’s just the way things go/If you’re Black you might as well not show up on the street/Unless you want to draw the heat.”

I had a brief followup with Dylan, 79, one day after Floyd was killed in Minneapolis. Clearly shaken by the horror that had occurred in his home state, he sounded depressed. “It sickened me no end to see George tortured to death like that,” he said. “It was beyond ugly. Let’s hope that justice comes swift for the Floyd family and for the nation.”

These are edited excerpts from the two conversations.

Was “Murder Most Foul” written as a nostalgic eulogy for a long-lost time?

To me it’s not nostalgic. I don’t think of “Murder Most Foul” as a glorification of the past or some kind of send-off to a lost age. It speaks to me in the moment. It always did, especially when I was writing the lyrics out.

Somebody auctioned off a sheaf of unpublished transcripts in the 1990s that you wrote about J.F.K.’s murder. Were those prose notes for an essay or were you hoping to write a song like “Murder Most Foul” for a long time?

I’m not aware of ever wanting to write a song about J.F.K. A lot of those auctioned-off documents have been forged. The forgeries are easy to spot because somebody always signs my name on the bottom.

Were you surprised that this 17-minute-long song was your first No. 1 Billboard hit?

I was, yeah.

“I Contain Multitudes” has a powerful line: “I sleep with life and death in the same bed.” I suppose we all feel that way when we hit a certain age. Do you think about mortality often?

I think about the death of the human race. The long strange trip of the naked ape. Not to be light on it, but everybody’s life is so transient. Every human being, no matter how strong or mighty, is frail when it comes to death. I think about it in general terms, not in a personal way.

There is a lot of apocalyptic sentiment in “Murder Most Foul.” Are you worried that in 2020 we’re past the point of no return? That technology and hyper-industrialization are going to work against human life on Earth?

Sure, there’s a lot of reasons to be apprehensive about that. There’s definitely a lot more anxiety and nervousness around now than there used to be. But that only applies to people of a certain age like me and you, Doug. We have a tendency to live in the past, but that’s only us. Youngsters don’t have that tendency. They have no past, so all they know is what they see and hear, and they’ll believe anything. In 20 or 30 years from now, they’ll be at the forefront. When you see somebody that is 10 years old, he’s going to be in control in 20 or 30 years, and he won’t have a clue about the world we knew. Young people who are in their teens now have no memory lane to remember. So it’s probably best to get into that mindset as soon as we can, because that’s going to be the reality.

As far as technology goes, it makes everybody vulnerable. But young people don’t think like that. They could care less. Telecommunications and advanced technology is the world they were born into. Our world is already obsolete.

A line in “False Prophet” — “I’m the last of the best — you can bury the rest” — reminded me of the recent deaths of John Prine and Little Richard. Did you listen to their music after they passed as a kind of tribute?

Both of those guys were triumphant in their work. They don’t need anybody doing tributes. Everybody knows what they did and who they were. And they deserve all the respect and acclaim that they received. No doubt about it. But Little Richard I grew up with. And he was there before me. Lit a match under me. Tuned me into things I never would have known on my own. So I think of him differently. John came after me. So it’s not the same thing. I acknowledge them differently.

Why didn’t more people pay attention to Little Richard’s gospel music?

Probably because gospel music is the music of good news and in these days there just isn’t any. Good news in today’s world is like a fugitive, treated like a hoodlum and put on the run. Castigated. All we see is good-for-nothing news. And we have to thank the media industry for that. It stirs people up. Gossip and dirty laundry. Dark news that depresses and horrifies you.

On the other hand, gospel news is exemplary. It can give you courage. You can pace your life accordingly, or try to, anyway. And you can do it with honour and principles. There are theories of truth in gospel but to most people it’s unimportant. Their lives are lived out too fast. Too many bad influences. Sex and politics and murder is the way to go if you want to get people’s attention. It excites us, that’s our problem.

Little Richard was a great gospel singer. But I think he was looked at as an outsider or an interloper in the gospel world. They didn’t accept him there. And of course the rock ‘n’ roll world wanted to keep him singing “Good Golly, Miss Molly.” So his gospel music wasn’t accepted in either world. I think the same thing happened to Sister Rosetta Tharpe. I can’t imagine either of them being bothered too much about it. Both are what we used to call people of high character. Genuine, plenty talented and who knew themselves, weren’t swayed by anything from the outside. Little Richard, I know was like that.

But so was Robert Johnson, even more so. Robert was one of the most inventive geniuses of all time. But he probably had no audience to speak of. He was so far ahead of his time that we still haven’t caught up with him. His status today couldn’t be any higher. Yet in his day, his songs must have confused people. It just goes to show you that great people follow their own path.

On the album “Tempest” you perform “Roll on John” as a tribute to John Lennon. Is there another person you’d like to write a ballad for?

Those kinds of songs for me just come out of the blue, out of thin air. I never plan to write any of them. But in saying that, there are certain public figures that are just in your subconscious for one reason or another. None of those songs with designated names are intentionally written. They just fall down from space. I’m just as bewildered as anybody else as to why I write them. The folk tradition has a long history of songs about people, though. John Henry, Mr. Garfield, Roosevelt. I guess I’m just locked into that tradition.

You honour many great recording artists in your songs. Your mention of Don Henley and Glenn Frey on “Murder Most Foul” came off as a bit of a surprise to me. What Eagles songs do you enjoy the most?

“New Kid in Town,” “Life in the Fast Lane,” “Pretty Maids All in a Row.” That could be one of the best songs ever.

You also refer to Art Pepper, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson and Stan Getz in “Murder Most Foul.” How has jazz inspired you as a songwriter and poet over your long career? Are there jazz artists you’ve been listening to lately?

Maybe Miles’s early stuff on Capitol Records. But what’s jazz? Dixieland, bebop, high-speed fusion? What do you call jazz? Is it Sonny Rollins? I like Sonny’s calypso stuff but is that jazz? Jo Stafford, Joni James, Kay Starr — I think they were all jazz singers. King Pleasure, that’s my idea of a jazz singer. I don’t know, you can put anything into that category. Jazz goes back to the Roaring Twenties. Paul Whiteman was called the king of jazz. I’m sure if you asked Lester Young he wouldn’t know what you’re talking about.

Has any of it ever inspired me? Well yeah. Probably a lot. Ella Fitzgerald as a singer inspires me. Oscar Peterson as a piano player, absolutely. Has any of it inspired me as a songwriter? Yeah, “Ruby, My Dear” by Monk. That song set me off in some direction to do something along those lines. I remember listening to that over and over.

What role does improvisation play in your music?

None at all. There’s no way you can change the nature of a song once you’ve invented it. You can set different guitar or piano patterns upon the structural lines and go from there, but that’s not improvisation. Improvisation leaves you open to good or bad performances and the idea is to stay consistent. You basically play the same thing time after time in the most perfect way you can.

“I Contain Multitudes” is surprisingly autobiographical in parts. The last two verses exude a take-no-prisoners stoicism while the rest of the song is a humorous confessional. Did you have fun grappling with contradictory impulses of yourself and human nature in general?

I didn’t really have to grapple much. It’s the kind of thing where you pile up stream-of-consciousness verses and then leave it alone and come pull things out. In that particular song, the last few verses came first. So that’s where the song was going all along. Obviously, the catalyst for the song is the title line. It’s one of those where you write it on instinct. Kind of in a trance state. Most of my recent songs are like that. The lyrics are the real thing, tangible, they’re not metaphors. The songs seem to know themselves and they know that I can sing them, vocally and rhythmically. They kind of write themselves and count on me to sing them.

Once again in this song you name a lot of people. What made you decide to mention Anne Frank next to Indiana Jones?

Her story means a lot. It’s profound. And hard to articulate or paraphrase, especially in modern culture. Everybody’s got such a short attention span. But you’re taking Anne’s name out of context, she’s part of a trilogy. You could just as well ask, “What made you decide to include Indiana Jones or the Rolling Stones?” The names themselves are not solitary. It’s the combination of them that adds up to something more than their singular parts. To go too much into detail is irrelevant. The song is like a painting, you can’t see it all at once if you’re standing too close. The individual pieces are just part of a whole.

“I Contain Multitudes” is more like trance writing. Well, it’s not more like trance writing, it is trance writing. It’s the way I actually feel about things. It is my identity and I’m not going to question it, I am in no position to. Every line has a particular purpose. Somewhere in the universe those three names must have paid a price for what they represent and they’re locked together. And I can hardly explain that. Why or where or how, but those are the facts.

But Indiana Jones was a fictional character?

Yeah, but the John Williams score brought him to life. Without that music it wouldn’t have been much of a movie. It’s the music which makes Indy come alive. So that maybe is one of the reasons he is in the song. I don’t know, all three names came at once.

A reference to the Rolling Stones makes it into “I Contain Multitudes.” Just as a lark, which Stones songs do you wish you could’ve written?

Oh, I don’t know, maybe “Angie,” “Ventilator Blues” and what else, let me see. Oh yeah, “Wild Horses.”

Charlie Sexton began playing with you for a few years in 1999, and returned to the fold in 2009. What makes him such a special player? It’s as if you can read each other’s minds.

As far as Charlie goes, he can read anybody’s mind. Charlie, though, creates songs and sings them as well, and he can play guitar to beat the band. There aren’t any of my songs that Charlie doesn’t feel part of and he’s always played great with me. “False Prophet” is only one of three 12-bar structural things on this record. Charlie is good on all the songs. He’s not a show-off guitar player, although he can do that if he wants. He’s very restrained in his playing but can be explosive when he wants to be. It’s a classic style of playing. Very old school. He inhabits a song rather than attacking it. He’s always done that with me.

How have you spent the last couple of months home-sheltered in Malibu? Have you been able to weld or paint?

Yeah, a little bit.

Are you able to be musically creative while at home? Do you play piano and tool around in your private studio?

I do that mostly in hotel rooms. A hotel room is the closest I get to a private studio.

Does having the Pacific Ocean in your backyard help you process the COVID-19 pandemic in a spiritual way? There is a theory called “blue mind” which believes that living near water is a health curative.

Yeah, I can believe that. “Cool Water,” “Many Rivers to Cross,” “How Deep Is the Ocean.” I hear any of those songs and it’s like some kind of cure. I don’t know what for, but a cure for something that I don’t even know I have. A fix of some kind. It’s like a spiritual thing. Water is a spiritual thing. I never heard of “blue mind” before. Sounds like it could be some kind of slow blues song. Something Van Morrison would write. Maybe he has, I don’t know.

It’s too bad that just when the play “Girl From the North Country,” which features your music, was getting rave reviews, production had to shutter because of COVID-19. Have you seen the play or watched the video of it?

Sure, I’ve seen it and it affected me. I saw it as an anonymous spectator, not as someone who had anything to do with it. I just let it happen. The play had me crying at the end. I can’t even say why. When the curtain came down, I was stunned. I really was. Too bad Broadway shut down because I wanted to see it again.

Do you think of this pandemic in almost biblical terms? A plague that has swept the land?

I think it’s a forerunner of something else to come. It’s an invasion for sure, and it’s widespread, but biblical? You mean like some kind of warning sign for people to repent of their wrongdoings? That would imply that the world is in line for some sort of divine punishment. Extreme arrogance can have some disastrous penalties. Maybe we are on the eve of destruction. There are numerous ways you can think about this virus. I think you just have to let it run its course.

Out of all your compositions, “When I Paint My Masterpiece” has grown on me over the years. What made you bring it back to the forefront of recent concerts?

It’s grown on me as well. I think this song has something to do with the classical world, something that’s out of reach. Someplace you’d like to be beyond your experience. Something that is so supreme and first rate that you could never come back down from the mountain. That you’ve achieved the unthinkable. That’s what the song tries to say, and you’d have to put it in that context. In saying that though, even if you do paint your masterpiece, what will you do then? Well, obviously you have to paint another masterpiece. So it could become some kind of never ending cycle, a trap of some kind. The song doesn’t say that though.

A few years ago I saw you play a bluegrass-sounding version of “Summer Days.” Have you ever thought about recording a bluegrass album?

I’ve never thought about that. Bluegrass music is mysterious and deep rooted and you almost have to be born playing it. Just because you are a great singer, or a great this or that doesn’t mean you can be in a bluegrass band. It’s almost like classical music. It’s harmonic and meditative, but it’s out for blood. If you ever heard the Osborne Brothers, then you know what I mean. It’s an unforgiving music and you can only it stretch so far. Beatles songs played in a bluegrass style don’t make any sense. It’s the wrong repertoire, and that’s been done. There are elements of bluegrass music for sure in what I play, especially the intensity and similar themes. But I don’t have the high tenor voice and we don’t have three-part harmony or consistent banjo. I listen to Bill Monroe a lot, but I more or less stick to what I can do best.

How is your health holding up? You seem to be fit as a fiddle. How do you keep mind and body working together in unison?

Oh, that’s the big question, isn’t it? How does anybody do it? Your mind and body go hand in hand. There has to be some kind of agreement. I like to think of the mind as spirit and the body as substance. How you integrate those two things, I have no idea. I just try to go on a straight line and stay on it, stay on the level.

The limited series, created by Damon Lindelof and based on a graphic novel, is set in an alternate history where masked vigilantes go after criminals decades after the actual Tulsa race massacre in 1921.

Smart plays Laurie Blake, a reformed vigilante turned no-nonsense FBI agent who has some internal conflicts of her own. “You’ve got to see so much of her public and totally private moments. It really was a gift as an actor,” Smart says of the series.

In this excerpt from the “Can’t Stop Watching” podcast, she also fills us in on a recent “Designing Women” reunion and shares some details about what she has coming up next.

Q: Laurie Blake is called in to Tulsa to investigate the death of Police Chief Jed Crawford. How much did you know about the story and the real-world massacre of Black citizens in Tulsa?

A: I knew nothing about that. It was shocking to me, shocking that I had never heard of it. And my father was a history teacher. It’s astonishing to think how prophetic the show was in a way, because first with the coronavirus and the idea that something happened that gave the entire world a common enemy and that that would help bring peace if we had something big to fight together. But then it was set against a historical event of unbelievable brutality against the Black community. It’s just incredible that Damon wrote that right before all of this happened, right before.

Q: What was your crash course into the world of “Watchmen?”

A: I went out for martinis with one of the writers and she gave me a lot of information about Laura’s background, her family and her relationships, because I knew nothing about it. “Watchmen” wasn’t something that my son had been into when he was growing up. I always feel like research is good. Just to a point, I mean, it was actually very valuable to know about her parents and her personal relationships. But research only goes so far. You have to base it really on the script.

Q: So much of what’s going on in the news right now is explored in the series: racism, cop culture, leadership. And fear — of fellow citizens or the use of fear to control.

A: We were doing the show in the time of our present administration, which is to say, that seems to be their tactic for everything. If you find out what people are afraid of, they have used that to get voters to come to their side. My character, she obviously has come to hate vigilantes. You know, she’s not a person necessarily to hold up as an example. She’s not the most ethical law enforcement person. She certainly doesn’t believe in people taking things into their own hands.

Q: Well, how is it to be part of art that takes on subject matter like this head-on?

A: Oh, it’s great. This is what actors crave. I mean, yes, sometimes you want to do stuff that’s just fun and just entertainment. But there was a quote from an actor a long time ago that said, “As an actor, if you want to believe that you can affect people in your audience in a good way, in a positive way, open their eyes to something.”

You also have to accept the fact that you can be a negative influence as well. You have to make your own personal wise choices about the kind of material you do. So you get to do something like “Watchmen,” it’s extremely rewarding. And it was nice that the audience responded the way it did. Of course, we had no idea what was coming. Like I said, it’s prophetic to an alarming degree. We had no idea about the pandemic. We had no idea how the race relations were going to come to a head in 2020.

Q: Your “Watchmen” character’s pining for somebody who’s been living on another planet for 30 years. How do you find the truth in that?

A: Good question! That says a lot about her. Then she finds out that he is living here with another woman. She thinks that she’s kind of got it all together, but she’s really kind of a mess. And she tells Angela (Regina King) that, you know, you don’t strike me as the kind of person who has friends. I’m thinking just look in the mirror! She’s living alone, in an apartment with an owl and has a closet full of black pantsuits and no social life whatsoever. She’s in love with a man who likes shoes. Like you said, she hasn’t seen in 30 years. And another guy who’s in prison. A shrink would have a field day with her.

Q: Sony has a YouTube channel called Throwback TV, and they have been getting together shows that are no longer on the air, like “Designing Women,” and having the actors do a remote table read of one of the scripts. How was that?

A: Delta (Burke) was not able to participate. She’s taking care of her mother. And unfortunately, we don’t have darling Dixie Carter. We read the pilot script. You would not have thought that 30 years have gone by for Annie (Potts). I mean, we just felt like we were right back there. It was just so much fun. It was weird not having an audience laughing, but it was really fun.

A: I actually just got a deal producing a movie that I might also be in for Amblin. It is a combination of somewhat topical and also very uplifting and entertaining, hopefully a working title as “Miss Macy.” I hope it turns into something in the way that we envision it right now. I’m also in the middle of another one, a miniseries with Kate Winslet. And it’s been such an amazing time. I love Kate and I play her mother. They live together and they can’t stand each other. And they’re very blue-collar South Philly. I look forward to getting back to it. I’m not quite sure when we will.

Q: What are you watching while at home?

A: My guilty pleasure is HDTV. “Fixer Upper,” my relationship with my husband is sort of like their relationship. Also, I’ve recently discovered “Flea Market Flip.” I really desperately want to be on that show.",[],1116,0.8743220169498171

The Grammy Award-winner says the Apple TV+ show incorporates experiences of many striving artists while reflecting the diversity of its New York City setting.

“There are moments that are more inspired by my life rather than it being any sort of recreation of my journey.” Bareilles said. “This is an amalgamation of so many of the struggles that I’ve seen.”

The show from Bareilles, producer J.J. Abrams and writer-director Jessie Nelson follows a young singer named Bess King (Brittany O’Grady) as she navigates life and love while attempting to pursue her musical dreams.

It’s the first foray into television for both Bareilles and Nelson, who worked together on the Broadway musical “Waitress.” Bareilles said both want to keep making “hopeful art.”

“I love that Jessie and I both are very committed to making hopeful art — art that has a lot of heart and a lot of kindness and a lot of hope sort of woven into what we create,” said Bareilles. “It’s nice to be able to get an opportunity to tell stories about characters who are messy and make mistakes and are flawed and certainly are not perfect people, but that, in essence, are good people and they try to be good.”

Bareilles relished the novel experience of working in TV.

“I got to learn so much from this,” she said. “I felt very much like a newbie stepping in. They had to tell me, ‘Don’t stand in front of the lights on the set.’ I was like, ’Oh, my bad, my bad!”

Bareilles wrote original music for “Little Voice” and helped direct musical performances from O’Grady, who previously appeared on the musical series “Star.” The first three of 10 episodes premiere Friday.

Nelson, who directed five episodes, said that while the series comes at a time when Hollywood is working to amplify under-represented voices, diversity came naturally to this production.

“We really wanted to write a love letter to the music of New York, and if you’re going to do that authentically, you’re just organically going to have a diverse cast,” she said.

O’Grady praised the “true diversity” she encountered on set.

“You have the scenes in the retirement home: we had actors in their 90s on the set. We have actors who are on the spectrum. We have actors who are Black, white, Hispanic,” she said. “I think that it’s just an honest portrayal of what the real world is. So that makes me happy.”",[],424,0.8803114649364691

Whiteknife is a businessman in the northern Alberta oilsands and also a glamorous female recording artist known as “Iceis Rain.”

In season 2, which airs Sundays on APTN, Whiteknife moves to Edmonton and works on his mental health, while Ices Rain is curbing the clubbing lifestyle to focus on her next album.

The Canadian Press recently spoke with Whiteknife by phone from Edmonton to discuss the show and current events.

CP: What are you most proud of when it comes to season 2?

Whiteknife: There’s so many amazing moments but I like the fact that I was able to be exactly who I am and I didn’t have to face any scrutiny or anybody that was very aggressive in the process of filming, which was actually quite shocking. The camera crew was worried for me to dress up as Iceis Rain and walk down the street in daylight. They were scared because they thought, ‘Oh my God, what if somebody comes and gay-bashes you or what if somebody throws something at you?’ I would tell them, ‘Do you see the way you guys are feeling right now because you’re with me? That’s how me and my people — the (LGBTQ) people and the Indigenous people — feel every single time we walk out our door.’ That to them was just like — what a wake-up call. For you guys to have to feel this fear every day. It’s stressful. So for me, I told them this is why I’m doing what I’m doing. This is why I tell you guys no holds barred. Show everything in the show because I want people to see the successes that I have been able to achieve but I also want you guys to show the failures and the struggles that I also have to face every day.

CP: Have you faced discrimination in the oil patch and have you noticed more acceptance in the region since the show started?

Whiteknife: The way I came out was I did an anti-bullying show in Fort McMurray. I asked the companies that I work for if they would sponsor the event. When they found out what kind of event I was actually doing — like dressing up in drag and I was going to have drag queens — they didn’t care that the money I was raising was going to non-profit organizations, they cared about the fact that their name was going to be associated with somebody that was not only gay, but dressed up as a female. And I lost 10 of my largest clients. They just flat out told me, they said, ‘We are not going to be associated with this. We’re sorry but we’re cutting your contract.’ That started the struggle for me and Iceis and my company. I just said, ‘OK, well you know what, I don’t want to work with people like that anyway.’ Then when I did do the anti-bullying show, the local newspaper had put a thing on it and I ended up getting like 25 new clients because of it.

CP: Can entertainment serve as a blueprint to help people, especially in marginalized communities, cope through times of hardship?

Whiteknife: I think so. A perfect example, take for instance, Hollywood. If you look back in the day, the big movie companies wouldn’t allow to have a Black screenwriter. They wouldn’t allow to have a Black actress in a leading role and it wasn’t until one person finally stood up and said, ‘I’m the executive of this production company and we are going to have a Black lead actress.’ And it ruffled a lot of feathers in Hollywood. Just like in the oil sands, they’re like, ‘We’re not going to allow a female business owner run the company. We’re not going to have a female tell the men, the union people, what to do.’

But it wasn’t until somebody actually does it that people will start to calm down and realize that it’s no big deal and that we’re just human beings. Life goes on and we all have to face the same challenges of bidding, contracts, negotiations and profit margin.

CP: How much has the conversation changed on the anti-Indigenous racism front in the wake of recent examples of police brutality around the world?

Whiteknife: What I’ve noticed just personally in being here in Alberta is that there was a lot of vocal haters. There was a lot of people that were saying, especially to my friend, Chief Allan Adam, there was a lot of people that were coming forward saying he deserved it or he provoked it or that wasn’t racism. It’s that sort of ignorance that to me, left me shaking my head. How could somebody, by tackling another person to the ground and bashing their face in like that, be justifiable in any circumstance? That’s the kind of conversations that go on over here that we have to face. It’s sad but it is real.

CP: In season 2, the show’s protagonist deals with a self-improvement journey. Given the challenges in the world right now and many people looking within to be better versions of themselves, is that a topic that more people can relate to?

Whiteknife: Yes, absolutely. 100 per cent. Because right now it’s a struggle for me. I am open about my addictions on the show. I suffer from alcoholism and drug addiction and gambling. A lot of that stems from the sexual abuse that I endured when I was a child. The bottle kind of helped me cope. It didn’t really help me though. It just made things worse. But right now with COVID, having to be isolated, there’s no resources available at all. I want to go to an AA meeting when I’m feeling like I’m going to fall off. Or that I’m feeling this stinking thinking where, ‘Right now a bottle of gin would be perfect.’ I don’t have the opportunity right now to go to an AA meeting because of social distancing and because they were all shut down. I pray every night for my people because there are a lot of people right now that have internet that could go online and that can take an AA meeting. But there’s people that depended on those meetings to go to that were in smaller communities that don’t know how to use the internet or don’t have access to the internet. So it is really hard.

The women of Netflix’s version totally get it,'Yvonne Villarreal',2020-07-02 00:00:00,"Countless women who came of age in the 1980s and ’90s have memories of “The Baby-Sitters Club” books that provoke a nostalgic, pastel-hued wave of heart-eyed emojis.

Rachel Shukert, a producer and writer known for her work on “GLOW” and “Supergirl,” received the first book as a birthday present. Scanning the description on the back cover, Shukert, then in elementary school, wasn’t all that intrigued. But one uneventful afternoon she finally cracked open “The Ghost at Dawn’s House,” book No. 9 in the series, clutching the ends of its warm, peach-toned cover with the same steady grip of a kid today clinging to a tablet. She was hooked.

An entire shelf inside her bubblegum-pink room at her family home in Omaha, Nebraska, was eventually jammed with the recognizable rainbow block of spines (“I kept them very separate and special from all the other books,” Shukert, now 40, says. “The shelf would get bigger and bigger since there were more and more books.”) During recess at Friedel Jewish Academy, on a knoll out of ear shot of the school, she and her friends would talk about the book series, trade copies and sometimes pretend to be the characters.

Growing up in a suburb of Springfield, Mass., Lucia Aniello, best known for her work on Comedy Central’s “Broad City,” vividly remembers how her insatiable appetite for the book series resulted in stacks of free pizza certificates as part of Pizza Hut’s Book It program, which rewarded kids for reading. (”My parents owned a pizza restaurant, so I couldn’t use them,” Aniello, 37, notes with a laugh. “I actually ended up kind of becoming popular and I would hand out free pizza slips because I had no use for them.”)

Still fresh is Aniello’s memory of lying in the family’s backyard hammock as a kid, reading book after book until the moon nudged the sun away.

Decades after those formative years reading about the plucky, ragtag group of middle-school babysitters in fictional Stoneybrook in the book series launched by author Ann M. Martin in 1986, Aniello and Shukert are now responsible for translating the franchise’s binge-reading power into a TV series for the streaming generation. (Shukert is the showrunner, while Aniello serves as a director and executive producer.)

Premiering Friday, the 10-episode reboot opens with a modern wink to an origin story as important to some as Spider-Man’s or Batman’s. Sporty seventh grader Kristy Thomas (Sophie Grace) watches as her single mom, Elizabeth (Alicia Silverstone), is in need of a sitter to watch her youngest son. Elizabeth huffs about young people these days being hard to get in touch with, as well as the high fees of internet-based babysitting services: “When I was a kid, my mother would just call some girl in the neighbourhood on a landline,” she says. “And she would answer, because it was part of the social contract.”

Kristy’s great idea is born: a babysitting club.

She enlists her shy bestie Mary Anne Spier (Malia Baker) as secretary, their artistic friend and neighbour Claudia Kishi (Momona Tamada) as vice-president, fashionable new girl from New York City, Stacey McGill (Shay Rudolph) as treasurer and eventually, environmentally conscious California transplant Dawn Schafer (Xochitl Gomez) as an alternate officer. (Claudia also serves as the resident BSC host because she has a phone — one of those now-vintage transparent landlines with brightly-colored hardware — in her room.)

“When I saw them all together for the first time, that was one of the top five moments of my life,” Shukert says. “Maybe ahead of my wedding, but after having my son.” The way she speaks with reverence about the series, it’s easy to believe she isn’t joking.

That adoration, steeped in childhood memories untouched by the corrosion of time, made for a surreal adaptation process. Shukert says rereading the original book series, which ran until 2000 and has sold more than 180 million copies, she was struck by how she remembered very specific details — like Stacey painting her toenails with pink polish accented by a green dot or Claudia having white tights with plaits all over them or how Eleanor Marshall, one of the kids the girls babysit, was allergic to strawberries. But what came more sharply into focus was how the girls’ environment and experiences shaped how they navigated the world. She points to Kristy as an example.

“She is viewed as being bossy and controlling and has to have all the ideas, and she’s such a leader,” Shukert says. “And then you think about Kristy in a kind of emotional context and she’s this kid whose dad walked out on her when she was, like, six years old and never called her and had no contact with her family. Her mom has done this on her own. And you’re like, of course she’s controlling. She needs to control her environment because her early life lacks a lot of control. I think I sort of didn’t see that as a kid, because why would you?”

In her early 30s when tapped to write the original book series, Martin has watched the literary saga get a Hollywood filter before. HBO had a short-lived adaptation in 1990 and there was a 1995 feature film, which starred ’90s all-stars Rachael Leigh Cook and Larisa Oleynik, that grossed less than $10 million (U.S.). Martin said it was important for her to be involved with the Netflix series, story-wise, from the beginning. She read scripts, offering the occasional note. (For example, in the sixth episode, Claudia’s grandmother Mimi mentions she doesn’t like peaches because she associates them with trauma in her childhood. Martin reminded Shukert that Claudia has an aunt named Peaches who is introduced in book No. 47.) She also visited the show’s set in Vancouver.

“I was just desperate for her approval,” says Shukert, who adds that she received a signed copy of her favourite book in the series, “Little Miss Stoneybrook ... and Dawn,” from Martin during production. “She’s such a huge figure in the lives of many women my age. It was kind of overwhelming.”

“I had a sort of ‘I’m not worthy,’ ‘Wayne’s World’-type response to her,” is how Aniello describes it.

The Netflix series manages to evoke a certain time-capsule quality — it’s infused with the books’ signature sherbet colour palette and the girls’ wardrobe seems yanked straight off the book covers — while also feeling current. Shukert and Aniello felt strongly that the girls should feel like an updated version of their literary counterparts, particularly when they’re using cellphones, without diluting their essence.

“It’s definitely for today’s viewers,” Martin, now 64, says over the phone from her home in upstate New York. “But I think it still retains all the parts of the (book) series that young kids fell in love with 35 years ago. Just listening to the things that the characters care about, looking at the way that they’re dressed, how they interact with each other. It’s my girls.”

That remains true even as the group became more diverse onscreen: Mary Anne is biracial, Claudia’s Japanese heritage comes more sharply into view and Dawn is Latinx.

“The series from the beginning has been about inclusivity,” Martin says. “We wanted to have a diverse cast of characters. So some of the characters have changed a little bit and I hope any kid who watches the show will find themselves when they see this Stoneybrook and the characters.”

A fundamental principal both Shukert and Aniello felt strongly about was infusing the young characters with as much dimension as they’ve given to the adult characters they’ve shaped on “GLOW” and “Broad City,” without sacrificing the angst of middle-school growing pains.

“I feel like ‘GLOW’ and ‘The Baby-Sitters Club’ share a lot of DNA, honestly,” says Shukert, while revealing that “GLOW’s” Dawn (Rebekka Johnson) and Stacey (Kimmy Gatewood) are named after “The Baby-Sitters Club” characters. “It’s this group of women, or girls, who are very different from one another, who come from different backgrounds, and they’re coming together with this shared vision of creating something larger than themselves and being something greater, and finding their power in each other.”

Adds Aniello: “We really wanted to make something for young girls that treated them like real people that weren’t glossy in any way. ‘Freaks and Geeks’ was a show we talked a lot about, how they felt as fully fleshed out as adult characters, they just happened to be younger.”

The network said it had received a complaint last Thursday from an attorney about the misconduct. An outside investigator was hired and, based on the results of that probe, Fox fired Henry.

Henry, who co-anchored “America’s Newsroom” between the hours of 9 a.m. and noon on weekdays, had slowly rehabilitated his career on Fox following a four-month leave of absence that ended in 2016. That followed published reports of an extramarital affair that he had conducted with a Las Vegas cocktail waitress.

Fox offered no details of the complaint that resulted in Henry’s firing, only to say that it happened “years ago.” Henry could not immediately be reached for comment.

The alleged victim is represented by noted sexual harassment attorney Douglas Wigdor. He also would not provide any details of the case.

Henry’s former co-anchor, Sandra Smith, announced the firing on the air. Fox said she’ll continue in her role with rotating co-anchors until a full-time replacement is hired.

Henry, a former White House correspondent for Fox, was only recently elevated to the role on “America’s Newsroom.” He got the job after Bill Hemmer moved to Shepard Smith’s afternoon time slot.

In a memo to staff, Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott and President Jay Wallace reminded employees of Fox’s 2017 overhaul of its human resources operation and the avenues they can follow with a sexual harassment complaint.

Fox’s late former chairman, Roger Ailes, was fired in 2016 following harassment allegations made by former anchor Gretchen Carlson. Prime-time anchor Bill O’Reilly lost his job a year later following the revelations of settlements reached with women who had complaints about his behaviour.",[],283,0.9903342191564249

Simon & Schuster, 440 pages, $39.99

By this point in his career, Stephen King knows that the legions of loyal readers he addresses in his author’s notes will read anything he puts out. That he has continued to push his work into new territory only proves that he is a far more serious and “literary” author than his critics give him credit for. “If It Bleeds” is a kind of “odds and sods” of King’s latest shorter fictions, though the title piece, at just under 200 pages, could have been published as a novel. “If It Bleeds” features one of King’s favourite supporting characters, Holly Gibney, the tenacious private detective of the Mister Mercedes trilogy and “The Outsider,” here elevated to main-character status for the first time. The other novellas/long stories move nimbly between genres and tones, often in the same work, proving that King still has plenty of gas left in the tank — good news for us loyal readers.

From the Wreck by Jane Rawson

Picador, 272 pages, $19.99

In 1859, the passenger steamship “Admella” struck a submerged reef off the South Australia coast, a disaster that claimed the lives of most of those on board. Author Jane Rawson was researching the life of George Hills, an ancestor who survived the sinking, when she began to spin the incident into a fabulist story of a shape-shifting alien who saves Hills from drowning. “From the Wreck” follows Hills from the night before the sinking (he was a ship’s steward) to his troubled life as a disaster survivor haunted by his encounter with the otherworldly presence. A first-rate and deeply humane blend of historical fiction, fantasy, sci-fi and horror.

The Ghost in the House by Sara O’Leary

Doubleday, 190 pages, $22.95

This compact, eerie novel dives deep inside the metaphor of the ghost, a restless spirit bound to an earthbound location, by artfully employing a first-person ghost as narrator. Fay wakes up just before dawn lying on top of a piano, dressed in one of her husband’s shirts. Assuming she passed out drunk the night before, Fay wanders her dark Vancouver home trying to find her bedroom. Time seems to cut out and Fay is standing at the top of the stairs watching a girl she’s never seen before walking down the hallway. Thinking that she must be seeing a ghost, Fay soon realizes that she is the ghost. “The Ghost in the House” is short-story and children’s author Sara O’Leary’s debut novel. It may not satisfy some straight-up horror fans, but there is plenty here to haunt the imagination.

Home Before Dark by Riley Sager

Dutton, 400 pages, $36

In 2017, Riley Sager, the pseudonym for author and editor Todd Ritter, hit the bestseller lists with “Final Girls,” a fierce postmodern twist on the hoary horror trope (a “final girl” is the last woman standing in an ’80s slasher film). In “Home Before Dark,” Sager explores the dilemma of a different kind of survivor. Maggie Holt was only five when her family fled a haunted country manor house called Baneberry Hall after a mere 20 days of occupancy. Since then, Maggie’s life has been defined by the bestselling memoir her father wrote about the experience. When her father dies, she is shocked to discover that she has inherited Baneberry Hall and, despite her mother’s and father’s warnings, Maggie returns to the house to confront her past. Maggie is at times too much the Strong Female Protagonist, now a thriller/horror cliché in its own right, but “Home Before Dark” is a smart, page-turning work with special appeal for readers who, like me, love the haunted house sub-genre.

By Anastasia Higginbotham

Dottir Press, 64 pages, $28.50

“Not My Idea: A Book about Whiteness” explores white privilege and racism in an age appropriate way.

Going Up

The word choice and illustrations gently disrupt the many stereotypes associated with various identities. Readers learn about the importance of building a community where all people are respected for their differences and feel a sense of belonging.

You Matter

By Christian Robinson

Atheneum Books for Young Readers, 60 pages, $23.99

“You Matter” is a beautiful story that teaches us that, old or young, we matter and are connected. An important story because sometimes our identities can make us feel excluded, ignored and silenced. A great way to send the message that we “see” people in our communities, value them and acknowledge their different experiences. It is powerful to be “seen” completely for who we are and to know that we are respected and loved for all parts of ourselves. A very affirming story that reinforces our importance and self worth.

Deborah Underwood’s “Outside In”, illustrated by Cindy Derby (Harcourt Houghton Mifflin, 32 pages, $24.99, ages 3-7), resonates even in the shadow of lockdown. “Once we were part of Outside and Outside was part of us,” begins this story aimed to tempt kids to explore nature. Instead, Underwood’s take on Outside shows ways nature reaches indoors — through sunlight, our clothes, even the water gushing from our taps. We might forget we’re part of nature, but Outside reminds us. A wonderfully perceptive mix of poetry, art, and environmental awareness.

Akiko Miyakoshi’s “I Dream of a Journey” (Kids Can, 32 pages, $18.99, ages 3-7) suits Covid-19 shut-in fatigue. “In my dreams I set off on a journey …” says a bear hotelier, and he dreams of travelling to places his guests have been, to beaches and windswept dunes. When he wakes from his colour-filled sleep, he’s back in his own hotel. There’s something eerie yet familiar in Miyakoshi’s muted art, the bear’s timid wanderlust, and travel that can happen only in dreams.

Deborah Hodge celebrates the real “Outside” in “West Coast Wild Babies,” with lose-yourself-in-them illustrations by Karen Reczuch (Groundwood, 32 pages, $19.95, ages 3-6). In simple language Hodge describes some of the Pacific coast’s many baby creatures — gray wolves, orcas, harbour seals, oystercatchers and more. Reczuch’s pellucid colours show the scene with idealized serenity (no “graveyard of the Pacific” tumult here), heightening natural beauty, baby life and security.

Ibram Kendi’s “Antiracist Baby,” illustrated by Ashley Lukashevsky (Kokila, 24 pages, $11.99, all ages), brings the vital issue of antiracism to babies and all readers in a jaunty, challenging board book. Here are nine clear steps to acting for and practicing racial equity. Kendi’s words are few but his content is deep: “open your eyes to all skin colours … use your words to talk about race …” With its acknowledgement that “Antiracist Baby is bred, not born,” this timely book can be a first step in discussing our own society.

Andrea Curtis explores nature in urban spaces in “A Forest in the City,” illustrated by Pierre Pratt (Groundwood, 40 pages, $19.95, ages 10 and up). In a direct, informative text, she tells us of urban trees and the perils posed by city soil, pollution, and neighbourly peccadilloes. Pratt’s illustrations balance the staid text with playfulness and humour, showing trees’ glorious greenery among and around humans’ busy ways. Pratt’s art conveys the joie-de-vivre trees bring; Curtis’s text provides the science.

In Rebecca Stead’s “The List of Things That Will Not Change” (Wendy Lamb, 224 pages, $22.99, ages 10-14), set in New York, Bea tells the story of her father’s wedding to his gay partner. To do it, she takes us back to the time of her parents’ divorce, her ensuing life in two homes, her bad spelling, and her efforts to befriend her step-sister. Stead is a marvel at ravelling up her tale through interlocking pieces, past and present, and here she’s at her best. Bea’s slow revelation of what’s in her heart happens with colourful, precise incident, each page deepening emotional intensity.

First Nations sleuths the “Mighty Muskrats” travel from their reservation to the city in Michael Hutchinson’s “The Case of the Missing Auntie” (Second Story, 181 pages, $10.95, ages 8-13). While they contend with city ways, they try to find out what happened to Grandpa’s sister, scooped by the government and adopted years ago. This quick, engaging mystery (indeed, the series) is a real gift to Canadian readers, most particularly for the Indigenous familial culture and social and historical realities it portrays.

A strong sense of place and down-to-earth narrator characterize Riel Nason’s “Waiting Under Water” (Scholastic, 216 pages, $8.99, ages 9-12). Loving her home on the Bay of Fundy, Hope is terrified when her family decides to move to Toronto. Her nervous tic worsens as departure day approaches, and in a refreshing plot twist, her parents change their plans.",[],659,0.9597156501520725

It’s abundant, highly decorated, and unafraid of extravagance, of stylistic excess: “The Mairs, the Mairs — what were they and why on earth? I have been collecting eccentric trueborn Nova Scotians my entire life but none compare, pound for pound, person for person, with the Titus Mairs of Tower Road. The Maritime provinces of Canada are saturated generally with peculiars — drunks, pundits, misfits, masterminds — but the Mairs were the oddest on record, functioning in the years of my childhood on an almost mythopoeic level.”

That unrestrained nature extends to size itself: nearly 400 pages, “Aubrey McKee” ends with “End Book One”; another four volumes will complete the series.

A book composed of fourteen exuberant, freewheeling stories, each focused on a peculiar “peculiar,” “Aubrey McKee” has “the insanity of being human” as a general theme. More specifically, this coming of age story also operates as a love letter, of a sour-sweet sort, to home. That’s Halifax, “a shabby little city … worn stale and flat in detail,” in the view of one source mentioned by the narrator, and an “evil village” and a place “obsessed with itself,” in the words of narrator Aubrey McKee’s sisters.

Whether he’s recalling his phase as “an indiscriminate teenage joiner” or as a marijuana salesman in the mid-1970s, Alex Pugsley’s narrator writes from the point of a man well settled into middle age who’s seeking lost time, place, and meaning. He says as much: “I have done by my to recover those moments, to display them as best I could and to display the mysteries — and people — who were to me the city’s truths.”

While McKee (who, like Pugsley, seems to have been born in 1963) can evaluate an incident in literary terms — as “a fantasia on Maritime themes — brilliancy, loss, nostalgia decay,” for example — he also conjures with fantastic, captivating detail a youth where parents, siblings, friends, and school jostle alongside episodes of municipal history (itself teeming with bootleggers, drug dealers, suicides, sanatorium habitués, eccentric scions of formerly grand families, and brothel keepers).

From ordinary incidents — a childhood acquaintance, marital strife, a wedding — as well as a few extraordinary ones, “Aubrey McKee” builds a dazzling and complicated world, a childhood in Halifax as a vibrant universe in itself. While Pugsley’s literary performance is an immediate delight, the portrait of the early days of a “wayward oddity” lingers long after.

Brett Josef Grubisic’s latest novel is “Oldness; Or, the Last-Ditch Efforts of Marcus O.”

By Cara Black

Soho, 360 pages, $35.95

Fans of Cara Black’s nineteen novels featuring the plucky Parisian private eye, Aimee Leduc, should now make way for Kate Rees, likewise plucky and likewise serving the cause of justice in Paris. But unlike the French Aimee of the 2000s, Kate is an American-born Allied spy operating in German-occupied Paris in June 1940.

Kate, a sharp shooter extraordinaire, is assigned to assassinate the Fuhrer himself when he makes an appearance at the Sacre-Coeur Cathedral in Montmartre. Kate’s shot misses — the bullet takes out a German admiral standing behind Hitler — and she spends the following hair-raising day and a half slipping around Paris, avoiding Nazis on her trail, seeking the undercover route to safety in England.

The story packs in all the Second War spy story staples: nasty Germans and nastier French collaborationists; traitors to the Allied cause and infiltrators of its espionage apparatus; cameo appearances by Churchill and multiple off-stage rants from the Fuhrer. All of this, in Black’s familiar style, is relentless, honest and immaculately researched.

Sister Dear

By Hannah Mary McKinnon

Mira, 360 pages, $23.99

The narrator, 30 and an IT wizard in Portland, Maine, has been hard done by. Just before the man she has always thought to be her dad died, she learned her biological father was actually a rich man-about-Portland. When she approaches him with love in her heart, he slams her out of his life. At that low point, she sets out to win a little justice and fair play.

What follows is a plot heavily weighted in red herrings, much misdirection and several fake leads. There’s a murder, but it comes so close to the book’s end that it’s almost meaningless. All the rest is expertly dodgy and entertaining.

Hurry Home

By Roz Nay

Simon & Schuster, 260 pages, $24.99

Sibling rivalry has seldom been so fraught.

Alex, the youngest sister by five years, has a solid job and a hunky live-in boyfriend in a Colorado town. Ruth, who split from Alex and the rest of the family ten years earlier, unexpectedly shows up. She’s loaded with awkward baggage: a stretch in prison, a stash of cocaine and money belonging to a sinister drug dealer who’s on her trail. Ruth is also five months pregnant.

Both sisters spin contrasting but believable lines of narrative explaining their contrasting life histories. As the dark and creepy story grows more complex with every chapter, the question becomes: which sister is speaking the truth? The answer finally arrives not without huge surprises for all concerned, the reader conspicuously included.

By Scott Turow

Grand Central, 455 pages, $37

It seems only yesterday — it was actually July 1987 — when Scott Turow introduced Sandy Stern, the absolute ace of criminal attorneys, to American crime fiction. That was in “Presumed Innocent,” and now, many novels later, here is Stern back again. Despite his age (he’s 85) and various frailties, he performs gloriously in what may be Turow’s most legally complex book.

Stern’s client is a man of medicine who conceived a cancer cure that won him a Nobel Prize and made him a zillionaire. Now patients on his regimen are dying. The government charges him with a slew of crimes, fraud and murder not excluded. Everybody goes to court where we all stay, vastly entertained, for almost the entire book.

If law schools offer doctorates in criminal law, “The Last Trial” would seem to make a definitive textbook. It is amazingly instructive, and amid all the heavy-duty learning, Turow treats us to one chapter that is as darkly comic as anything he has written. Check it out.

By Marie-Andrée Gill, translated by Kristen Renee Miller

Book*hug, 88 pages, $18

Spare and image-driven, the poems in “Spawn” chart a young woman’s coming of age with a captivating mix of lyricism and earthy candour. Marie-Andrée Gill is Pekuakamishkueu, and grew up on the Mashteuiatsh Reserve on the shores of Lake Piekuakami (Lac Saint-Jean) in Quebec. She uses the life cycle of freshwater salmon, which inhabit the lake (hence the book’s title), as a frame for her own growth. There’s teen sex and partying, but also a yearning to connect to her heritage, despite the stifling effects of colonialism, conveyed in the image of “four cement teepees/engraved:/…drab procession/the story drawn, lifeless.” Gill often returns to the idea of lacking words (the original book was written in French, not her Indigenous language), and her effort “to lick the skin of the water/with a tongue I don’t speak.” In the end, there’s a sense of affirmation, beautifully expressed: “I know we are blue plumage/the symmetry of spruce/the language of hailstones.”

Roguelike

If you know that “roguelike” refers to a type of video game, you have an advantage in appreciating the ingenuity of Mathew Henderson’s second poetry collection. But being a non-gamer (as I am) isn’t an obstacle, primarily because the emotions driving the poems are so resonant. Henderson applies the tropes of role-playing games — particularly the structure of quests, traps and perils— to make sense of a painful family history. The speaker looks back on a mother who was addicted to narcotics and a father he struggles to see as a man and not just in his paternal role. His figurative language is striking and evocative: “You already knew how a house could pile/upon your chest, could pin you as sure as a railway spike,” he writes, an image that viscerally conveys the crushing weight of memories. At the heart of this powerful book is a longing to gain perspective and move on from a difficult past.

The Dyzgraphxst

By Canisia Lubrin

McClelland & Stewart, 166 pages, $21

Complex and kaleidoscopic in range, Canisia Lubrin’s second collection is a sweeping meditation on Black identity, the meaning of home and the rupture caused by slavery (as she puts it, “how many ways can you disappear/a people, dignity by dignity”). The meditations address a character called Jejeune, and sift through a lyric collage of recollections and reflections. Lubrin’s turns of phrase crackle with evocative immediacy, whether she’s describing the past (“the twisted timbres of a ship/from some unknown century”) or the present (climate change is “the scorching heat of a moneyed world”). She returns often to the connection of language to being, and the agency in speaking. Dysgraphia is the inability to write coherently, and by replacing the “i” in dyzgraphist with an “x” in the book’s title, Lubrin signals her ambitious quest to understand identity in historical context in both an individual and communal sense (in her words, “the ballasts of who we/are”).

I started off a somewhat resistant reader of Paul Legault’s revamping, in 21st century style and queer sensibility, of W. B. Yeats’s classic “The Tower.” But Legault won me over, in part because he’s thematically faithful to Yeats’s anguish over mortality and disenchantment with the world, but also because he’s so entertaining. In Legault’s poems, that world is absurd, fixated on pop culture, celebrity and the banal preoccupations of our digital age, all of which he blithely skewers. “This is no country for old men” (the opening line of Yeats’s iconic “Sailing to Byzantium.”) becomes “This country’s too young to think —/…dying’s gotten old.” Like Yeats, Legault draws on mythology and the occult, albeit while eschewing lofty language, and he rambles cheerfully through the minutiae of television shows and fashion trends. But there’s also an underlying uneasiness about the future in the face of climate change: as Legault puts it, “Everything’s a little Cormac-McCarthyish.”",[],675,0.9671368986963848

Wiersema',2020-06-06 00:00:00,"“All I Ask,” the debut novel from award-winning St. John’s short story writer Eva Crocker, begins with a violation. Twenty-something Stacey is still in bed when she is awakened by “the doorbell ringing and a pounding that shook the house.” Her roommate isn’t home, and she’s confronted with members of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, waving a warrant and barging into her house. She returns, repeatedly, to the fact that she isn’t wearing a bra, that she’s not wearing her contacts, so she can barely see, as she struggles to keep her cats inside while the men — all men — search her apartment for “illegal digital material.”

The novel opens with the chilling lines “They took my computer and phone so they could copy the contents. They called it a mirror image. They said it was the fastest way to prove I wasn’t the suspect and also I didn’t have a choice.”

That opening chapter seems, initially, to be the set-up for a particular sort of novel; it isn’t. While the police raid and its effects run throughout the story, they’re not what the story is about. “All I Ask” is a powerful coming of age cri de couer, rather than a thriller or novel of wrongful prosecution.

With sly wit and sharp emotional acuity, Crocker explores the next few months in the lives of Stacey and her circle, including her best friend Viv; Holly, the mysterious and alluring recent transplant to St. John’s; and Kris, who repairs bikes and with whom Stacey shares an instant chemistry. The novel delves deeply into Stacey’s life and past, everything from early sexual experiences to the cyclical changes in her body, while at the same time encompassing a vital, passionate and often fraught community.

This intimate immediacy not only connects the reader to the central characters — it opens the novel up to a broader generational examination.

Stacey and her friends live in a post-binary world, where old constructs of gender identity and sexual attraction, along with external moral judgement, no longer seem to exist. But it’s also a world of disenfranchisement and insecurity. While they all have training and degrees, the members of Stacey’s community are struggling to get by; Stacey herself, despite a theatre degree, works in the box office rather than on the stage, picking up occasional work voicing radio ads.

It’s a world of uncertainty set against a historical backdrop of the environmental protests against the controversial Muskrat Falls hydro-electric project in Labrador, and the not guilty verdict against Doug Snelgrove, a police officer accused of sexual assault. “On the stand, he said he’d known she was drunk; he said that he had sex with her while he was on duty, while he was in uniform with a gun attached to his pants.”

“All I Ask” unfolds with a casual, almost aimless quality, a slow drift through a series of moments in these lives. It’s a wickedly funny, sexy, joyous novel, threaded through with sadness, uncertainty, and emotional risk.

More than anything, though, it’s a novel that is unafraid to show its heart, always broken, always healing, always open.",[],512,0.9749462089488011

Soulpepper Theatre’s “The Brothers Size” took five awards in the general theatre division while “The Mush Hole,” from Kaha:wi Dance Theatre and Young People’s Theatre, took an equal number in the young audiences division.

The next biggest winner was the Canadian Opera Company’s “Rusalka,” which took four prizes in the opera division.

The awards were handed out by the Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts in an online ceremony.

“The Brothers Size,” a play about two Black brothers in the Louisiana bayou by Oscar-winning screenwriter Tarell Alvin McCraney (“Moonlight”), won Outstanding Production, Outstanding Direction for Mumbi Tindyebwa Otu and Outstanding Feature Performance for Daren A. Herbert. It also won for costume design and lighting.

The other winners in the general theatre division included Tarragon Theatre’s “Buffoon” by Anosh Irani, which took Outstanding New Play and Outstanding Lead Performance for Anand Rajaram. Soulpepper’s “Almighty Voice and His Wife” won for scenic design and “Julius Caesar,” from Groundling Theatre and Crow’s Theatre, for lighting design.

“The Mush Hole” is the nickname for the Mohawk Institute Residential School in Brantford, which operated as a boarding school for Indigenous children from 1829 to 1970.

The theatre production of that name, based on interviews and writings by survivors, won both Outstanding Production and Outstanding New Play as well as Outstanding Direction for Santee Smith, who also created it. It also took Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble and projection design.

The award for individual performance in the young audiences division went to Malindi Ayienga for Young People’s Theatre’s “You and I.”

In the musical theatre division, the prizes were shared among six productions, with “Caroline, or Change,” from Musical Stage Company and Obsidian Theatre, and “Ghost Quartet,” from Crow’s Theatre and Eclipse Theatre Company, taking two each.

“Caroline” claimed both the performance awards, with Jully Black winning Outstanding Lead in her musical theatre debut and Vanessa Sears taking Outstanding Feature Performance.

“Ghost Quartet” won for direction for Marie Farsi and lighting design for Patrick Lavender.

Named Outstanding Production was David Mirvish’s “Piaf/Dietrich,” while Bad Hats Theatre’s “Life in a Box,” by Landon Doak and Matthew Finlan, took Outstanding New Musical.

Eclipse Theatre’s “Sunday in the Park With George” and Young People’s Theatre’s “The Adventures of Pinocchio” rounded out the category with awards for musical direction and choreography, respectively.

Coal Mine Theatre’s “Marjorie Prime” won the most awards in the independent theatre division, including Outstanding Production, Outstanding Direction for Stewart Arnott and Outstanding Lighting Design for Nick Blais.

Native Earth Performing Arts’ “This Is How We Got Here,” by Keith Barker, took Outstanding New Play.

The prize for Outstanding Performance by an Individual went to Alexander Thomas for another Coal Mine production, “Between Riverside and Crazy.” And the ensemble performance award went to the cast of “Casimir and Caroline” from the Howland Company. That play also took the costume design award.

The award for sound design went to “Box 4901” from timeshare performance and scene design went to “Prophecy Fog,” co-produced by the Theatre Centre and Paper Canoe Projects with Nightswimming Theatre.

The Canadian Opera Company was the main winner in the opera division with “Rusalka” taking Outstanding Production, direction for David McVicar, musical direction for Johannes Debus and lighting design for David Finn.

Outstanding New Opera went to “Shanawdithit,” by Yvette Nolan and Dean Burry, co-produced by Tapestry Opera and Opera on the Avalon.

The individual performance award went to Marnie Breckenridge for Tapestry’s “Jacqueline,” and the cast of “Two Odysseys: Pimooteewin/Gallabartnit” took the ensemble prize. It was co-produced by Soundstreams, Signal Theatre and the Sami National Theatre Beaivvas.

In the dance division, “hollow mountain” by Rock Bottom Movement was named Outstanding Production. Outstanding Choreography went to Crystal Pite for the National Ballet of Canada’s “Angels’ Atlas,” which also won the design award for Jay Gower Taylor.

Although an exact date for performances to resume has yet to be determined, Broadway producers are now offering refunds and exchanges for tickets purchased for shows through Jan. 3.

“The Broadway experience can be deeply personal but it is also, crucially, communal,” said Thomas Schumacher, chairman of the board of The Broadway League, which represents producers.

“The alchemy of 1,000 strangers bonding into a single audience fuelling each performer on stage and behind the scenes will be possible again when Broadway theatres can safely host full houses,” he added. “The safety of our cast, crew, orchestra and audience is our highest priority and we look forward to returning to our stages only when it’s safe to do so.”

Broadway theatres abruptly closed on March 12, knocking out all shows — including 16 that were still scheduled to open — and postponing indefinitely the Tony Award schedule. Producers, citing health and city authorities, previously extended the shutdown to June 7 and then again to Sept. 6.

In London, producer Cameron Mackintosh has said his company’s West End productions of “Hamilton,” “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Mary Poppins” and “Les Miserables” won’t reopen until 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., has cancelled most previously announced performances and events through the end of 2020, as has the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston.

Broadway grossed $1.8 billion (U.S.) last season and attracted a record 15 million people. Producers and labour unions are discussing ways theatres can reopen safely.

The latest extension wipes away many shows planned for the fall. Many have just moved to next year, including a revival of “The Music Man” with Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster that was to start rehearsals on June 29 but will now open in May 2021.

Shows that were to open this spring have abandoned their plans, including “Hangmen” and a revival of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” A production of “The Minutes” by Tracy Letts and “American Buffalo” by David Mamet will arrive on Broadway in Spring 2021, opening exactly one year after their originally scheduled opening dates.",[],364,0.9496821017586916

The company’s production of Wagner’s “Parsifal” will be rescheduled for the 2022/23 season. “Marriage of Figaro” is simply cancelled. Also falling victim to the new rules is a popular free noon concert series and other events.

The remainder of the COC’s 2020/21 season is, for now, intended to proceed as planned, with Bizet’s “Carmen,” Verdi’s “La Traviata” and more still scheduled for January through May 2021.

The company’s spring 2020 season was cancelled in March as the pandemic arrived in Canada.

Since then, COC general director Alexander Neef said in Monday’s release, it’s been pondering what its near future could safely be, but “opera gathers talent from all around the world to work together in close quarters, requires an extensive rehearsal schedule, plenty of advance planning and — to remain economically viable — an auditorium full of people, without whom no live performance is complete.

“Taking all of these factors into account, plus the many unknowns around public health guidelines in the fall, this was the only viable course of action to ensure the continued safety of our artists, staff and audiences.”

The COC Ensemble Studio will continue to develop Canada’s top young opera artists by working remotely as required. The company says that in recent months its trainers have used digital resources to deliver vocal, diction, language, dramatic and performance kinetics coaching among others.

The cancellation of the COC’s first production of “Parsifal” will “come as a disappointment to many,” Neef said. “This production caps a decade-long, community-led effort to stage Wagner’s final work here.”

A recently commissioned production of “Fantasma,” by COC composer-in-residence Ian Cusson with libretto by Colleen Murphy and intended for young audiences, will be moved from December to sometime in spring 2021. The company is working to create webinars, interactive programming and other educational material in a digital format.

Options for affected ticket-holders range from tax receipts issued for ticket donation, converting ticket value to gift certificate credits that never expires, or full refunds; complete details are listed at coc.ca/FallTickets.

Both the COC’s home venue, the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, and the company’s administrative office remain closed to the public until further notice, with full-time staff continuing to work off-site.

The COC has created a digital content hub at coc.ca/Hub, home to a “Virtual Choir,” a video chorus that received hundreds of submissions from all over the globe; “Songs of Hope,” an intimate online concert from the COC Ensemble Studio slated to premiere on July 9; and “Opera Makers,” a series of bite-sized video tutorials for young people.

But in recent months, it has also laid claim to a more unlikely title: path-breaking musical of the COVID-19 era.

As theatres around the globe were abruptly shuttered by the pandemic, with no clear path to reopening in sight, the world tour of “Phantom” has been soldiering on in Seoul, South Korea, playing eight shows a week. And it has been drawing robust audiences to its 1600-seat theatre, even after an outbreak in the ensemble led to a mandatory three-week shutdown in April.

The musical, with its 126-member company and hundreds of costumes and props, is believed to be the only large-scale English-language production running anywhere in the world. And it has remained open not through social-distancing measures — a virtual impossibility in the theatre, either logistically or financially, many say — but an approach grounded in strict hygiene.

And it’s one that its composer, Andrew Lloyd Webber, is arguing can show the way for the rest of the industry, a point he is hoping to demonstrate to the world, as he prepares to turn the Palladium, one of seven theatres he owns in London, into a laboratory for lessons learned in Seoul.

“I don’t think we should just be sitting on our hands and saying, it’s all doom and gloom, we can’t do anything,” he said in an interview last week. “We have got to make the theatres as safe for everybody as we possibly can,” he said. And South Korea, he said, shows that it can work.

That the show, at the Blue Square cultural complex in central Seoul, has gone on is a testament not just to the protocols in the theatre, but to South Korea’s rigorous system of test, trace and quarantine, which has kept the virus largely under control.

It was also a matter of sheer timing and luck, though it didn’t seem that way at first.

When the tour’s previous stop in Busan, South Korea’s second biggest city, wrapped up in mid-February, the country was emerging as the latest epicentre of the pandemic.

The company mostly went home for a break to Britain, Italy, North America, Australia and elsewhere. Serin Kasif, vice president of Lloyd Webber’s company, the Really Useful Group, and the producer of the tour, said she was fielding daily messages from company members anxious about whether to return.

On March 2, when Kasif flew to Seoul to begin preparations to open there, South Korea had the second-highest number of confirmed cases, and the pandemic had not yet fully hit Britain.

She contrasted the “overwhelming sense of fear” that developed in London with what she had experienced in Seoul, with its clear governmental directives and local partners who had lived through previous epidemics like SARS.

“When I was speaking to our Korean partners, in lead-up to the decision to continue, one said, ‘The word “unprecedented” keeps getting used, but it’s not unprecedented here,’ ” she explained.

“Amazingly,” Kasif said, the entire company returned to Seoul. Matt Leisy, a Northwestern University graduate who plays Raoul, said that when he went home to New York during the break, friends were “freaking out” at the idea that he might go back to Korea. But he said he was reassured by the producers’ constant communication about safety protocols, as well as their videos of daily life in Seoul.

“It was quite scary leading up to us coming back,” he said. “Who knew we’d end up being in the safest place in the world?”

The protocols, which are mandated by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are strict, but they are not particularly space-age. Before entering the theatre, audience members are sprayed with a light mist of disinfectant. Thermal sensors take each person’s temperature, and everyone fills out a questionnaire about symptoms and recent places they’ve visited, so they can be notified of any exposures they may have had through the country’s contract-tracing app.

There are hand-sanitizing stations throughout, and ubiquitous signs and announcements reminding everyone that masks must be worn at all times. And in contrast to movie theatres, where alternating rows or seats are left empty, no seats are blocked off (though the first row was removed).

Backstage, there’s a similar drill: no embracing, no handshakes, no inessential physical contact. Reusable water bottles are forbidden, along with sharing food. Wigs, props and costumes are regularly sprayed or wiped with antibacterial cloths. Everyone must wear a mask, except for actors when they are being made up or go onstage, and some members of the orchestra.

Sharon Williams, the head of wardrobe, said that masks and “constant handwashing” aside, protocols for the 17-member costume department are not that different than they would be normally, beyond extra cycles of high-temperature washing with antibacterial soap.

The crucial element, she said, is the whole company’s rigorous co-operation. “No one is saying ‘I’m not going to do it,’” she said.

As for the onstage action, Kasif said there have been no modifications — and yes, Raoul and Christine still kiss.

Which isn’t to say the actors haven’t had nerve-racking moments. Leisy said initially he was “hyperaware” of all the saliva flying around the stage, especially in big numbers like the Act Two showstopper “Masquerade.”

“When I enunciate, the spit really flies out of my mouth,” he said. “At one point, we’re all dancing and singing our faces off and I look around and see all this saliva flying. I thought, ‘My goodness!’”

(The first row of seats is a seemingly safe 5.2 meters from the edge of the stage, according to a video issued by the show’s Korean producer in early May detailing the safety precautions.)

The run, which has been extended until August (after the touring production of “War Horse” set to follow in the same theatre cancelled), has not been without its bumps. In late March, about two weeks after the show opened, one of the show’s ballerinas said she wasn’t feeling well. She was tested, and the result — positive — was back by 9 a.m. the next morning.

Authorities moved swiftly to lock down the theatre and check if all guidelines were being followed. A mobile testing unit was installed on the roof of the apartment building where the cast and nonlocal crew live, and everyone was immediately tested both for active virus and antibodies. (A male ensemble member also tested positive but remained asymptomatic.)

All 76 members of the touring company were quarantined for 15 days in their apartments. The local employees were also tested, and quarantined at home. (A local production of “Dracula: The Musical” also decided to suspend performances in this period, in response to the outbreak at “Phantom,” according to local news reports.)

In keeping with local policies, the more than 8,000 people who had seen “Phantom” received text alerts informing them of the outbreak. Another announcement, which Kasif said was drafted in conjunction with authorities, was sent to patrons, describing the safety measures that had been in place.

Kasif suggested the fact that the virus had not spread more widely in the company was proof, at least “anecdotally,” as she put it, that the protocols work.

“The ballerinas are a very close ensemble,” she said. “They share a dressing room, warm up together, perform together, warm down together. They happen to be very good friends socially. So if the guidelines weren’t working, on paper they all should have had coronavirus.”

The show reopened on April 23, and ticket sales have been about 70 to 85 per cent full since, Kasif said. Even last Thursday, when a spike in cases in the country led authorities to close all public museums, galleries and entertainment venues across greater Seoul until June 15, the seats were mostly full, according to a reporter who attended. (Publicists for the show declined to provide box office information.)

Private venues, like the Blue Square, were allowed to remain open, and “Phantom” continues to operate “in accordance with KCDC guidelines and instructions,” Kasif said in a statement.

Several audience members expressed concern about the spike, but said they trusted the theatre’s measures and the country’s larger public health response.

Yi-seul Lee, 28, a graphic designer, had seen the musical in March and said she didn’t want to miss the chance to see it again. “Unless we shout very loudly while watching the show or take off our masks, I think we are more or less safe,” she said.

Still, some fans thought the uncertainties of the pandemic had dampened spirits a bit. In-hae Bae, 36, a human resources manager who was seeing “Phantom” for the sixth time, said that every time the actors embraced, the virus popped into her head. And the applause at the curtain call, she said, seemed “timid.”

“They were way too calm,” she said of the audience. “It made me think, ‘Coronavirus must have strangled our passion, too.’”",[],1483,0.9017154170852372

Stratford will hand over its social media channels to Indigenous artists Friday and Saturday, June 19 and 20, in advance of National Indigenous Peoples Day on Sunday, June 21.

The initiative follows a similar move the weekend of June 6 when the festival turned its platforms over to Black actors and artists — sparking a wave of testimony and activism that has already led to policy and leadership changes in national theatre.

Over the next two days, past and present Stratford Festival artists and theatre workers with Indigenous heritage will run the company’s Twitter, Instagram and Facebook feeds using the hashtag #DecolonizingTheStage.

On June 20, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., a YouTube panel will take place, titled “Ndo-Mshkogaabwimi — We Are Standing Strong: Stories of endurance, resilience and resistance from members of the Indigenous circle at Stratford.” It will include artists Jani Lauzon, Quelemia Sparrow, Lisa Nasson and Jessica Carmichael from this season’s postponed production of Tomson Highway’s “The Rez Sisters”; actor Gordon Patrick White; director Cole Alvis; and former Stratford associate artistic director Dean Gabourie. They will be joined by elder Liz Stevens from Kettle and Stony Point First Nation.

“This is a group of artists that have these particular points of view and these particular experiences,” said Lauzon, who has taken the lead on organizing the takeover and will moderate the “Ndo-Mshkogaabwimi” panel. “But we do not speak for the entire community because it’s so vast and different in the way that we work, who we work with and how we intersect with theatre.”

Lauzon said each social media feed will have its own purpose: Twitter and Instagram will amplify more activist-driven arguments and experiences, Stratford’s Facebook page will be devoted to individuals who worked with the festival in the past, and the YouTube panel will provide room for in-depth, complicated discussions of Indigeneity and colonial systems in Canadian arts and culture.

“We’re here to repeat the things that we have been saying, knowing that there is a deeper listening going on, which is the exciting part, as well as maybe disclosing things that we felt unsafe saying before,” she said.

Reneltta Arluk — the first Inuit person and the first Indigenous woman to direct a Stratford production with “The Breathing Hole” in 2017 — is among the artists participating in the social media takeover. Director of Indigenous arts at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, Arluk was encouraged by the festival’s anti-Black racism venture, which resulted in an end to its “as cast” policy, which allows directors to cast actors in small roles without their consent.

“The way that Indigenous people have been treated for over 150 years by the Canadian government — they have been reminded that they need to assimilate, they need to move out of their home territories, their language is not recognized as official. Treaties and agreements are broken. These are the histories we carry in our bones and our veins,” said Arluk. “When we come to the table … we’re coming from that historical place of distrust.”

Lauzon echoed Arluk’s caution about Canada’s history of Indigenous oppression. The recent deaths of Chantel Moore and Rodney Levi during interactions with police in New Brunswick, and a video showing the violent arrest of chief Allan Adam in Alberta have renewed calls for change.

In Lauzon’s view, Canadians want to believe that “Canada is better somehow or that we’re not quite as bad as the circumstances are in the States. We’ve been very good at hiding things; we’ve been very good at not educating our youth,” she said. “It is an unfortunate residue of colonial thinking, which is an assumption of superiority.”

Stratford Festival artistic director Antoni Cimolino said the company has commissioned new works by Indigenous writers and began including more Indigenous voices in its programming over the past few years. “I feel strongly that, for the remainder of my tenure, I would like a play by an Indigenous writer in each season.

“I feel that we have a special responsibility to Indigenous people in Canada and that means we would really like to build a stronger relationship with this community of artists.”

But there has been greater learning for Cimolino in the way Indigenous theatre artists work. And it’s led to structural changes at Stratford, such as welcoming smudge ceremonies at the beginning of rehearsals, the inclusion of land acknowledgments before performances and modifying the pace of some creative processes.

“Usually in rehearsals, you’re rushing into a room, it’s last minute and you get right to it. There isn’t a sense of breath, of acknowledgment of who we are, where we are,” he said.

Observing the rehearsal process of “Pawâkan Macbeth” at the Banff Centre of Arts and Creativity in February was revelatory for Cimolino. It’s a Stratford-commissioned, Plains Cree retelling of Shakespeare’s “Macbeth,” written by Arluk and directed by Michael Greyeyes.

“For our Indigenous colleagues, the greeting at the top of rehearsal takes 20 minutes, half an hour. We don’t normally invest that much time to start the day,” Cimolino said.

“The payoff though was beautiful and I felt there was a sense of trust … This is part of a learning process for us that isn’t only about supporting our Indigenous colleagues, it’s also a learning process that I hope will make us a better place and our work better.”

She is of northern Manitoba Swampy Cree and Irish-settler descent. She offers insight into her life experiences as the Stratford Festival dedicates its social media platforms to First Nations artists.

When I learned that I would be going to the Stratford Festival to play Zhaboonigan Peterson in Tomson Highway’s “The Rez Sisters,” I was overcome with excitement, joy and gratitude. What a gift to work in a room full of powerful Indigenous artists. This felt like an opportunity that I dreamed of during my school days. My dream, and the play, were ultimately postponed by the pandemic.

I spent six years training as an actor and I earned two degrees. During that time I gained many skills — but none of those skills would prepare me for what lay ahead. I could not have foreseen the amount of work I would be required to do. Work that had nothing to do with acting.

As an Indigenous woman growing up in this country, I got used to the questions: “Where are you from?” I grew accustomed to the comments: “You’re so articulate!” I learned to smile, laugh it off and gently correct. “They mean well.” Mostly. This is how I learned to walk through the world safely.

As I journeyed from schooling into my career as an actor, I had not realized that the way I learned to walk through the world had grown into a full-time job. No benefits. No pay. The ways I had educated family, friends, co-workers, strangers on the bus, I now had to apply to the world of directors, people of influence, of power, those who could hire or fire me.

I learned to be soft and agreeable so as not to frighten anyone.

“Of course, I’m not saying you’re racist.” I learned to put a lid on my anger and to be so incredibly patient.

“I know, I know you’re trying.”

I picked my battles and let things slide, and made offers and tried my very hardest to soak my words in syrup to make the truth more palatable.

I have run out of ways and words and sweetness. I want to speak candidly. I want to tell the truth.

The truth is my people are dying.

It’s hard to know what to say after that.

This is my truth. It is my truth when I walk into the rehearsal room, onto the stage and when I am alone with my thoughts. This truth is heavy and larger than the confines that this space allows. To share it comes at a cost and I am just one person.

I am feeling extra tender these days. I’m thinking about all the artists who came before me. I am angry. I am heartbroken. Everyday I am learning and unlearning. I understand that I am not untouched by the sludge of anti-Black racism, white supremacy, patriarchy and colonialism. Black Lives Matter.

There is so much work left to do.

I long for the day I can be in a space with my fellow artists again, whether that be in picturesque Stratford or anywhere art can be made. I believe in what I do now more than ever. I have to.

I believe that the art I help create can reach people, teach people, offer comfort and hope.

Yes, I do have hope to offer. Not always a surplus but enough to keep the lights on. Yet there is still a lot more truth that needs to be brought into that light.",[],617,0.9192885975001901

Capturing history: Everyday snapshots tell the story of Canada’s LGBTQ people

Toronto’s culture is nothing without Black artists. But the predominantly white art world is part of the obstacle

If we can’t be with people, do we forget how to connect? No. Instead, we find new ways of sharing and understanding each other.

The students at Etobicoke School of the Arts, like other pupils honing their creativity across the city, the country and the world, usually have a year-end exhibition. They show and sell their work, hold a Portfolio Day to showcase the fruits of their labour and create connections with the larger, outside world.

This year, the Class of 2020 has taken the sale online.

“The tension with teaching and having the sale online is the loss of personal interaction with other people,” observes Matthew Varey, head of contemporary art at the Toronto high school. “We are used to engaging with brilliant, creative, humble, powerful and ambitious people every day. That is the loss I am feeling, and the one I hear from the students that is being felt most deeply.”

For Ella Webber, the just-graduated Grade 12 student and young artist who painted this portrait of “Charlotte,” her art is a way of connecting with her peers, with the people she encounters in the world each day. She creates large-scale portraits — the size of the art, she says, “increases the intimate connection that I share with it, strengthening my personal bond with my subjects and allowing my paintings to take on a life of their own.

“Through portraits I’m working to understand the complexities, nuances and possibilities of human connection.”

In exhibition, her portraits command our attention. The people in them demand we see their perspective and understand their stories.

These students are graduating to a wider world. By supporting them in their creativity and understanding the way they see the world, together we can all graduate to a better one.

To see the exhibition, learn more about these young artists or to buy a painting, go to the online sale at www.esava.ca. Half of the sale price goes to the students and half to the school — to inspire and support more students to create, and in so doing to encourage all of us to see the world through fresh eyes.",[],360,0.9032489657767772

And the historians strongly reject the idea that the mystery of its whereabouts has been solved, as claimed by a Spanish art dealer who says the painting is now sitting in a London warehouse awaiting a buyer willing to spend more than 40 million euros ($60.9 million).

Experts consulted by the Associated Press have concluded that published images of the work now on sale show nothing more than a copy of Kahlo’s painting.

Helga Prignitz-Poda, an art historian who has fruitlessly tried to track down the long-lost painting, said that there are clear differences between the work for sale and old photographs of the original and that there are similarities between the offered work with inaccurate replicas based on those old images.

In addition, she said, Kahlo did the painting on wood and not on canvas. The work for sale is described as a canvas painting.

Cristian López, the Spanish art dealer who says he represents the anonymous owner of the painting, stands firm in defending its authenticity.

“Time will give us the truth,” López said during a phone conversation in which he offered few details on the painting.

López, who is little known in the art world, said specialists have endorsed the painting’s authenticity, but he declined to identify them.

“Whoever proves genuine interest and the ability to pay the figure of 40 million euros, can spend as much time as wanted with their experts analyzing the work,” López said.

“The Wounded Table” was unveiled at the International Surrealism Exhibition in 1940 in Mexico City. It includes a self-portrait of Kahlo at a long table, flanked by a Holy Week Judas and a monster that embraces her, while the two sons of her sister stand at one end and her pet fawn is at the other. Blood flows from knots of the wood table, which is considered to represent the artist’s anguish of the just concluded divorce from Rivera.

Kahlo donated the painting to the Soviet Union in 1945 for a planned Mexico room at the Museum of Western Art in Moscow, but Soviet art officials disdained surrealism as decadent and the project was dropped. The Mexican works ended up in a cellar.

A year after Kahlo’s death, a Mexican group organized a travelling art exhibition for shows in Soviet bloc nations and arranged for a loan of “The Wounded Table.” Prignitz-Poda said there is photographic evidence the 46-inch by 98-inch painting was shown in Warsaw, but nothing is known of it after that. There is no clue whether it was returned to Moscow, destroyed or perhaps acquired by someone.

Susana Pliego, an art historian who has studied the work of both Kahlo and Rivera, is among the experts who don’t think the painting for sale is the real thing.

She said there is a big problem with faked Kahlo painting because the art market thirsts for more works by an artist who produced only about 200 paintings before her death in 1954.

“Fridamania has been a marketing invention,” said Pliego, who directs cultural programming at the Casa de México in Madrid and who worked for years on Kahlo’s archive. “Because her paintings are sold so expensively, someone makes a proposal to see if anyone falls for it.”

Hans-Jérgen Gehrke, an art collector who operates a museum dedicated to Kahlo’s works in southwestern Germany, considers it “implausible, if not directly ridiculous,” that an unknown 22-year-old businessman operating a website from a town in northwestern Spain is the guardian of the missing painting.

“There are thousands of Frida Kahlo fakes,” Gehrke said. “She is possibly the artist who has painted more dead than in life.”",[],668,0.9674239545367412

From spring to summer. From fearing each other to celebrating in each other’s presence. They are thoughts for our times, evoked by Inuit artist Jessie Oonark’s 1979 image “Angagok Conjuring Birds.”

Angagok (also spelled angakkuq) are often called upon to serve as healers or as keepers of justice in the community.

Here, they are transforming into birds, a recurring image in Oonark’s work, notes Sarah Milroy, chief curator of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, where a copy of this print resides. The figures, male or female, “serve as spiritual mediators, (and are) called to their roles through visions or dreams. Stories abound of their powers to fly or run as fast as the caribou.” Or to transform.

It is one of hundreds of images that Oonark, born in 1906 in the Barren Lands, north and west of present-day Baker Lake in the Kivalliq Region of Nunavut, created. She spent her early life in Utkusiksalingmiut camps, in traditional pursuits including dressing caribou and sealskins, as well as making parkas and other items of traditional clothing, wrote Janet Catherine Berlo in “North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century.”

In the late 1950s, Oonark moved to Qamani’tuaq — Baker Lake — and it was only when she was 59 that she began drawing and creating textile hangings. Soon she had her own art studio and, eventually, a salary.

Between 1970 and 1985 more than 100 of Oonark’s drawings were translated into prints and issued in Baker Lake’s annual print editions, Berlo writes. Three of her prints were also released through the famous Kinngait (Cape Dorset) print program between 1960 and 1961 — the only Inuk outside the community to have her work included in that collection. Her work hangs in the National Arts Centre; before she died in 1985, she was named to the Order of Canada.

Oonark’s compositions feature figures in traditional clothing, animals, and birds and traditional tools. In Inuit Art Quarterly, art critic and CBC reporter Robert Enright noted how “the whimsical, awkward gestures the figures make and the colours in the drawings speak unequivocally about Oonark’s uncompromising celebration of Inuit life.”

Now, we are able to see each other again in a world that doesn’t quite look like the one we lived in before. It’s time to reach out awkwardly to each other in a celebration of life. It’s time to heal.

It can bridge the space between individuals and cultures. It can bridge centuries. Even ancient stories have resonance today. Stories of love, war — and plague. The circumstances might not be exactly the same, but the parallels of experience and the universality of our emotions echo. When the world seems out of our control there’s comfort in that.

Often compared to Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet,” the story of “Layli and Majnun,” was written in 1188 and is one of five long romances from the poet Nizami’s “Khamseh” (Quintet). It tells of two young lovers who are prevented from being together by their families and community.

This illustration comes from a “Khamseh” manuscript dated 1527; it depicts the moment when, after many years of separation and emotional hardship that has left them physically weakened, Layli and Majnun are finally brought into each other’s company by a go-between.

They keep their distance, however, out of fear that the intensity of embracing each other would kill them. Instead, Majnun, a poet, sings a beautiful composition he has written to Layli in an expression of the intensity of his love.

As we are able, once again, to physically meet with friends and family after months of being apart, we can understand the emotion the two lovers feel. Whether we can understand the script or not, the illustrations encourage us to use our imaginations and create a story of our own using cues from the past.

And that’s poetry for you: even when we can’t understand the script, we can interpret the images. When we can’t understand the language, we can understand the emotion. Poetry’s images collide and refract, illuminating new ideas and connections. The breadth of human experience resonates and hums in the spaces between words, something we can experience together.

Taken with a hot-in-the-’90s disposable camera, the flash lighting is harsh and nobody is actually in focus.

Still, as a personal memory, I’ve always loved it for the tableau of emotions and body language and relationships unwittingly captured that night. I love it, too, for the reminders it gives me about my apparently quite coy, younger queer self. Hey now, baby dyke.

It was July 1999. That much I know for sure because it’s date-stamped on the back of the photograph. The rest, not so much. But after reaching out to four friends who were all there that night, the best we could come up with is that we think we’re at the much-missed Gypsy Co-Op for some queer club night, for maybe somebody’s birthday, maybe not.

I went digging through my personal archive because in the right-before times, I had spent two days at the ArQuives gleefully looking at hundreds of photographs just as terrible as this one.

Housed on Isabella Street, the ArQuives is Canada’s LGBTQ2+ Archives and the world’s largest independent collection of LGBTQ heritage materials. As part of my photo laureate activities, we had been working together to produce an exhibition of photographs that would have launched on the front face of City Hall during Doors Open Toronto and stayed up for Pride Month.

Responding to the 2020 Doors Open theme, “Open TO Music,” I had wanted to visualize the relationship between music and LGBTQ activism in Toronto, and so I searched for photos depicting the presence of music not only at conventions and at marches and at rallies, but also at gay bars and trans parties and queer picnics.

For those two days, I was like a drag queen in a wig store, giddied and in awe as I pored over box after box of photographs. Capital-H history is in there, yes, in the documentation of events such as the first Gay Pride march in 1972 and the demonstrations after the 1981 bathhouse raids. But it was the photographs of small-h history, of the everyday activism of trans and queer folks just living their best life, that moved me to tears again and again.

People have donated everything from 4x6 prints to strips of film negatives and sheets of slides, and while the collections do include images created by professional photographers for newspapers or photo shoots, the bulk of the bounty is made up of amateur snapshots or what are often called vernacular photographs.

These ordinary photographs taken by ordinary people have received increased interest from photography scholars and collectors lately, though their value in revealing social histories has long been appreciated by community-based archives.

As I studied image after image at the ArQuives, it was these everyday photographs that showed me the laughter and the flirting and the tender moments of the past but, decidedly and frustratingly, only those belonging to certain ordinary histories and not others.

Just as with similar LGBTQ archives elsewhere in Canada and in the U.S, the stories of white, cisgender gay men and lesbians were overwhelmingly dominant, with trans and queer Black, Indigenous and people of colour histories barely accounted for.

Although not everything can be recorded and collected, let’s be clear, this collective “archival silence” is rooted in transphobia and the racism that everyone suddenly seems overly eager to acknowledge and slightly less so to address. These oppressions have limited whose stories are seen as worth preserving, as well as who has even been told their stories are worth preserving in the first place.

Many of these archives were founded by white gay activists in the early ’70s and, as much as the reckoning was already underway, there is a new-found urgency to current efforts to continue to acknowledge their contributions, while also directly grappling with the problematic challenges posed by their legacies.

Two books raising some of these issues have already been released this year alone, “Documenting Rebellions: A Study of Four Lesbian and Gay Archives in Queer Times,” by former ArQuives executive director Rebecka Taves Sheffield, and “Out North: An Archive of Queer Activism and Kinship in Canada,” by Craig Jennex and Nisha Eswaran.

And then last month, Archivaria, the journal of the Association of Canadian Archivists, published an article by my colleague, Elspeth Brown, professor of history at the University of Toronto and long-time volunteer and board member at the ArQuives.

In describing her six years of helping to bring an intersectional, trans-inclusive framework to the organization, she echoes the present demand to actually take explicit action: “Making visible the materials of LGBTQ2+ people outside the white, cis, settler-colonial, usually gay male norm requires specific strategies and approaches; otherwise, the default historical formation of white ‘gay and lesbian’ people and their histories will continue to overdetermine the LGBTQ2+ archive.”

Along with Brown’s work at the ArQuives, these strategies have included a recent name change, hiring staff of colour, diversifying their 120-strong volunteer base and supporting exhibitions like last year’s “Legacies in Motion: Black Queer Toronto Archival Project,” in partnership with Myseum and Black Artists’ Network in Dialogue.

With this last project, rather than reproduce a colonial dynamic and collect the personal records themselves, the ArQuives supported the years of stewardship of local Black queer activists, including curator Courtnay McFarlane. As Brown notes, these postcustodial approaches “emphasize contributive justice and the addressing of structural inequalities.”

This leaves me with two options for my blurry photograph above and all of the others like it sitting on my shelves. But after my time looking and seeing and touching all of those other photographs, I can’t help but want a different experience for those who come after me. As soon as the ArQuives reopens, I suspect I’ll be headed over, boxes in tow. We are in #BlackSpring and Pride Month, and we deserve more.",[],987,0.960270124228283

While much of the province will be in Stage 3 as of July 17, the Greater Toronto Area will be in a wait-and-see mode.

Dine-in restaurants and bars can get back in business with limits on capacity and other public health measures in place such as mandatory seating of patrons when eating or drinking, government documents say.

Among the other enterprises that can reopen their doors with strict conditions include casinos, bingo halls, convention centres and meeting places, gyms, fitness centres, concerts and live shows, movie theatres, real estate open houses, sporting and race events, and tours.

Nightclubs will only be allowed to serve food and drinks to seated customers, with no dancing or congregating at the bar.

Under Stage 3, the maximum number of people allowed in a gathering is increasing to 50 inside and 100 outside, although the two-metre rule remains in place for people who don’t normally share a social bubble.

Wrestling and other prolonged contact sports are still out under Stage 3 unless modified to avoid participants from deliberate physical contact, the government says.

Amateur and recreational sports leagues can get back at it provided the same no-prolonged-touching rules apply.

Sporting event spectators will be subject to gathering and physical limits.

On the advice of public health officials, the government continues to prohibit amusement and water parks, dancing at restaurants and bars except in very limited circumstances, buffet-style food services, overnight stays at kids’ camps, private karaoke rooms, sports involving prolonged or deliberate contact, saunas, bath houses, steam rooms, oxygen bars and table games at gambling venues.

Scheduled to enter Stage 3 on July 17 are all parts of the province with the exception of Durham Region, Haldiman-Norfolk, Halton Region, Hamilton, Lambton, Niagara Region, Peel Region, Toronto, Windsor-Essex and York Region.

“Additional time is required to assess and monitor any impacts and readiness to move into Stage 3,” government documents say.

Taking to the water under the name Hornblower, two Canadian vessels that usually each operate at a 700-passenger capacity, have since July 2 only carried six paying passengers at a time — roughly 0.8% of the total customer load — with four crew members.

Mory DiMaurizio, general manager of Hornblower Niagara Cruises, said the main reason for the difference in passenger loads is the province put the boat business in a category of operations that limited it to a maximum of 10 people on board.

“The order in council that was issued by the province — the language was not as clear as it could be — it didn’t classify us as an attraction,” DiMaurizio said Monday.

“The funny thing is the province has recognized us as an attraction on many occasions. We were lumped in with ‘tour or guide services.’ So it really threw us for a loop.”

DiMaurizio said July 1 was the only day the company operated as an “attraction” and while there are no capacity limits under that category, the Hornblower self-imposed a restriction of 100 to 200 people, or a 30% capacity.

Towards the end of the day, DiMaurizio was informed by bylaw officers they were not complying with rules set out in their category and shut operations down. Since then, the business has complied with the six-passenger rule.

The Maid of the Mist, which tours Niagara Falls from the U.S. side, have been up and running since June 26 and are operating at 50% capacity — or 230 passengers per trip, according to the business’ website. A spokesperson for that company couldn’t be reached.

However, some on social media used contrasting photos to highlight how the two countries are faring with coronavirus numbers. On Monday, there were over 3.4 million cases in the U.S. compared to roughly 107,000 cases in Canada.

“Here’s the photo that captures the difference in the pandemic response between U.S.A. and Canada,” tweeted one person. “Maid of the Mist (U.S.A., blue ponchos) packed with tourists, Hornblower (Canada, red ponchos) only six passengers legally allowed. Fifty meters away and a chasm of difference.”

Maid of the Mist also encourages passengers to practice physical distancing and requires people to wear a face mask as a condition of admission. There are also health screeners, stations equipped with hand sanitizer, and enhanced cleaning measures.

The Hornblower similarly requires all passengers to don a face mask, buy advance timed tickets online, practice physical distancing, and sanitize their hands before coming onto the boat.

Over Canada Day, people filmed large crowds gathering at the Canadian side of Niagara Falls or groups strolling the Clifton Hill tourist strip.

Janice Thomson, of Niagara Falls Tourism, said visitors to the area are “still well below” a traditional summer level.

“A lifting of the restrictions on attractions such as Hornblower and waterparks will allow more families to spend time in the destination, knowing that many health precautions have been implemented,” she said.

The surprise apology marked a sharp about-face for the prime minister after weeks of trying to defend the controversial, sole-sourced contract with WE, and follows revelations his wife, brother and mother had been paid a combined $300,000 for appearing at WE events over the years.

“I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions given our family’s history and I’m sincerely sorry for not having done that,” Trudeau said during a news conference outside his Ottawa home on Monday.

“When it came to this organization and this program, the involvement that I had in the past and that my family has should have had me remove myself from these discussions. And I’m sorry that I didn’t.”

Trudeau said he was particularly sorry that the delay in the program caused by WE’s eventual decision to withdraw from administering the Canada Student Services Grant would harm students looking for ways to help in the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Young people who are facing a difficult time right now getting summer jobs, contributing to their communities, are going to have to wait a little longer before getting those opportunities to serve, and that’s frustrating.”

Trudeau announced general plans for the program in April and then details of the Canadian Student Services Grant followed June 25. The government said tens of thousands of students having a hard time finding summer work due to COVID-19 could volunteer up to 500 hours to earn the maximum $5,000 toward their post-secondary costs.

But the program came under immediate scrutiny after it was discovered that WE had been chosen to administer it. Trudeau said federal public servants had recommended the organization and that it was considered the only one capable of delivering the program.

Trudeau nonetheless faced accusations of cronyism and allegations of a conflict of interest over his past connections with WE. Those allegations only grew after revelations last week about the payments to his wife, brother and mother.

The prime minister and Finance Minister Bill Morneau both confirmed they did not recuse themselves from the cabinet vote that approved giving the contract to WE. One of Morneau’s daughters has spoken at WE events while another does contract work for the organization.

Morneau’s office on Sunday denied any link between his daughters’ involvement with WE and the contract to administer the student grant program, which Trudeau acknowledged would have paid the organization around $20 million.

WE has said, including in a full-page newspaper advertisement Monday, that money would only have covered its costs.

The government and WE terminated the deal on July 3. The federal Employment and Social Development Department has since taken over the program, though officials have acknowledged the change will result in delays in its roll out.

Trudeau sidestepped questions about whether he knew his family had received money from WE when cabinet was deciding whether to approve the contract, saying that he knew of their involvement with the organization but not the details.

Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is currently investigating Trudeau over a potential conflict of interest in relation to the deal with WE. The Conservatives and NDP have asked the watchdog to also look into a potential conflict of interest by Morneau.

The Conservatives have also said they want Trudeau to appear before the House of Commons’ finance committee to answer questions about how the arrangement with WE came to be.

Trudeau was noncommittal about doing so, saying he would look at any invitations and discuss them with his leadership team.

The opposition parties are also seeking an investigation by the Commons ethics committee, and Conservative Sen. Don Plett has written to the speaker of the Senate, calling for that body to be recalled this summer to begin a probe of its own.

The Globe and Mail reported on Monday that Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan and Trudeau’s chief of staff, Katie Telford, previously helped WE raise money before the Liberals formed government in 2015.",[],677,0.5721944435182851

California Governor Gavin Newsom shut bars and banned indoor restaurant dining statewide, while closing churches, gyms and hair salons in the hardest-hit counties.

Newsom acted as COVID-19 cases strained hospitals in several rural counties and as infections mounted in Los Angeles and parts of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Los Angeles is the second-largest school district in the United States and with San Diego has a combined 706,000 students and 88,000 employees.

President Donald Trump, seeking re-election in November, has demanded schools reopen nationwide for in-person learning in the autumn. His campaign views reopening schools as necessary for economic recovery, especially for working parents with young children.

Trump trails his presumptive Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, in opinion polls both nationwide and in swing states that decide elections.

Florida along with Arizona, California and Texas have emerged as the new U.S. epicenters of the pandemic. Infections have risen rapidly in about 40 of the 50 states over the last two weeks, according to a Reuters analysis.

Despite nearly 28,000 new COVID-19 cases in the last two days, Florida has announced no new measures such as a statewide mask mandate, and Disney World in Orlando remains open for business.

‘PEOPLE AREN’T LISTENING’

Linda Stuart, 70, a lifelong resident of Orlando, Florida, said she and her family were staying at home except to go to the grocery and were “painfully aware” how quickly cases are rising.

“But sadly, too many people aren’t listening,” she said. “This should be terrifying them, but it isn’t. Not enough people are even wearing masks.”

The rise in Florida cases emerged hours after Trump took swipes at health experts in his government leading the U.S. response to the pandemic and his relationship further frayed with infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci.

On Sunday, Florida reported a record increase of more than 15,000 new cases of COVID-19 in 24 hours. If Florida were a country, that would rank it fourth in the world for the most new cases in a day, behind the United States, Brazil and India, according to a Reuters analysis.

Florida’s Disney World welcomed the public on Saturday for the first time since March with guests required to wear masks, undergo temperature checks and keep physically apart.

Walt Disney Co faces a starkly different response in Hong Kong where the government has ordered the Disneyland theme park to close due to rising coronavirus cases.

Hong Kong recorded 52 new cases of coronavirus on Monday, bringing total cases to 1,522. In Florida’s Orange County, home to Disney World, cases rose by 623 to a total of 18,624, the fifth highest outbreak in the state’s counties.

With over 7.5 million residents, Hong Kong has more than five times the population of Orange County.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has called the state’s rise in cases “a blip” and told residents not to be alarmed.

Florida recorded more than 500 deaths this past week, compared with over 300 the prior week. It is one of about two dozen states where deaths have risen in the last seven days compared with the prior seven days, according to a Reuters analysis.

The number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Florida is quickly rising, with over 500 new patients in the past 24 hours raising to 8,000 the number in hospitals, according to a state agency.",[],575,0.8007345398571247

“Let me be blunt, too many countries are headed in the wrong direction, the virus remains public enemy number one,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing from the U.N. agency’s headquarters in Geneva.

“If basics are not followed, the only way this pandemic is going to go – it is going to get worse and worse and worse.”

Global infections stand at 13 million, according to a Reuters tally, with more than half a million deaths.

Tedros, whose leadership has been criticized by U.S. President Donald Trump, said that of 230,000 new cases on Sunday, 80% were from 10 nations, and 50% from just two countries.

The United States and Brazil have been worst hit.

WHO emergencies head Mike Ryan said some places in the Americas may need “limited or geographically focused lockdowns that suppress transmission in specific areas where transmission is frankly out of control.”

He urged countries not to make schools into a political football, saying schools could safely reopen once the virus had been suppressed.

Tedros said the WHO had still not received formal notification of the U.S. pullout announced by Trump. The U.S. president says the WHO pandered to China, where the COVID-19 disease was first detected, at the start of the crisis.

Trump, who at the weekend wore a protective face mask in public for the first time, has himself been accused by political opponents of not taking the coronavirus seriously enough, something he denies.

A two-member WHO advance team in China to investigate the origins of the coronavirus, first discovered in the city of Wuhan, is in quarantine, as per standard procedure, before beginning work with Chinese scientists, Ryan said.",[],299,0.8476043312158172

Hopkinson said it isn’t clear if her appearance was caused by a medical condition or an overdose, and that police have “significant concerns” for the woman’s safety. Officers from neighbouring downtown divisions are actively searching for her, he said.

The car, described as a blue Kia Rio hatchback with a rear-mounted bicycle rack carrying two bikes, was found shortly after 1 p.m. but the woman has still not been located.

The expletive-filled encounter went viral pitting a customer and a maskless manager, who was in breach of the state’s health and safety protocol.

Brandon Trotta had his children in the car when he found himself embroiled in the kerfuffle with the DQ staffer who refused to put on a facemask while serving customers.

Statements posted on social media from corporate headquarters confirmed the staffer has been “demoted” and “is being provided additional training.”

According to Storyful, Trotta pulled up to the window to collect the Blizzards he ordered when he spotted an employee working without a mask.

It has been mandated in the state of New York that all restaurant workers during their shift must wear a facemask.

The employee, who was a manager to boot, refused.

“You want me to be a Karen?” the manager, named Deb, asks in the video in referring to the pejorative slang term for an angry, entitled, oft-times racist white woman. “Because I’ll be a Karen, OK?”

Trotta then asked for his money back, prompting Deb to order an employee to give him “his f—ing money.” “Get the f— out of here” and “don’t come back,” she said in slamming the drive-through window shut.

“Put your mask on before you get your employees sick,” he said before pulling away.

The manager can be seen giving him the middle finger through the glass.

ST-APOLLINAIRE — The Sûreté du Québec continued their intensive search Monday for the father of two young girls whose bodies were found Saturday in a small town southwest of Quebec City.

The bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, were located in a wooded area in St-Apollinaire, but Martin Carpentier, who is suspected of abducting the girls, remains missing.

The SQ said the focus of their manhunt was an area near where the girls’ bodies were found on the weekend and where police found “pertinent elements” on Sunday.

“The elements that we possess lead us to think Martin Carpentier could still be around the area, or at least be in transit in that area,” said Sgt. Ann Mathieu, an SQ spokesperson.

Police did not specify what the items were, but as the search entered a fifth day, police raised the possibility Carpentier could be unconscious or dead, given the weather conditions and the potential he was injured from a car crash right before his disappearance.

“We can’t rule out the fact that he could be dead,” Mathieu said. “But also, he’s a suspect in our case, so it’s important for us to find Martin Carpentier, because the key to this event is Martin Carpentier.”

Police deployed a helicopter, a drone and police dogs as needed in the search.

The girls were last seen Wednesday and became the subject of an Amber Alert the next day. Police have said the girls and their father are believed to have been in a serious traffic accident on Highway 20 in St-Apollinaire on Wednesday about 9:30 p.m.

Investigators said the car was heading east when it skidded into the median, flipped over and landed on the shoulder on the opposite side of the highway. But police did not find any occupants inside the car when they arrived.

On Sunday, the manhunt for the 44-year-old Carpentier had authorities tightening the search in a thickly wooded area near where the young sisters from Lévis were found.

Residents had helped with the searches until Saturday, but police asked people to stay away from the area Sunday to let officers work.

The case has gripped the attention of the province, especially in the town of just over 6,000 people where it’s playing out and in the family’s hometown of Lévis, across the St. Lawrence River from the provincial capital.

The oldest of the sisters, Norah, was a member of a local chapter of the Association de Scouts du Canada — which primarily serves the French-speaking scouting community across the country.

Dominique Moncalis, a spokeswoman for the association, said Martin Carpentier had been a leader with the 128th Groupe Scout de Charny since last September.

It was a brief role, cut short when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the suspension of all activities in mid-March.

She said two leaders from the group have established a makeshift memorial inside a small gazebo in an area park, holding a vigil for Romy and Norah on Saturday night and again Sunday morning.

Stuffed animals, flowers and notes of condolence have filled the gazebo, Moncalis said.

Quebec Premier Francois Legault began a Montreal news conference on Monday by offering condolences to the family of the young victims.

“I’m shocked, and I believe all Quebecers are shocked like me,” Legault said adding police will do everything they can to find the father.

Legault also urged anyone who sees family members in difficulty or distress to get help, giving out a number for a parent help line.

“If you have trouble, if you don’t feel (in) control or if you see somebody close to you not being in control, having difficulties, you don’t need to be shy,” he said.

“You have to do something when you see that you’re in trouble before doing something terrible.”",[],635,0.9233116223652938

Judge Tanya Chutkan of the U.S. district court in Washington ordered the U.S. Department of Justice to delay four executions the department had scheduled for July and August until further order of the court.

Efforts to resume capital punishment at the federal level were underway within a few months of President Donald Trump’s inauguration in 2017, ending a de facto moratorium that began under his predecessor, Barack Obama, while long-running legal challenges to lethal injections played out in federal courts.

Judge Chutkan has been overseeing cases brought by inmates on death row who argue that the Justice Department’s new one-drug protocol breaks various administrative and drug-control laws and is unconstitutional.

The Justice Department had planned to execute Daniel Lewis Lee on Monday in Terre Haute, Indiana, using lethal injection of pentobarbital, a powerful barbiturate, for his role in the murders of three members of an Arkansas family, including an 8-year-old child, in 1996.

Some relatives of Lee’s victims opposed him receiving the death sentence while his accomplice in the murders, Chevie Kehoe, was sentenced to life in prison.

The department had scheduled two more executions for later in the week and a fourth in August, of Wesley Purkey, Dustin Honken and Keith Nelson, all convicted of murdering children.

The coronavirus pandemic has prevented some of the lawyers of inmates on death row from visiting their clients. At least one employee involved in the executions tested positive for COVID-19, the Justice Department said over the weekend.

On Sunday, an appeals court rejected an argument by some relatives of Lee’s victims, who sued for a delay saying they feared that attending his execution could expose them to the coronavirus.

FEDERAL EXECUTIONS RARE

While Texas, Missouri and other states execute multiple condemned inmates each year, federal executions are rare: only three have occurred since 1963, all from 2001 to 2003, including the 2001 execution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.

There are currently 62 people on federal death row in Terre Haute.

Opposition to the death penalty has grown in the United States, although 54 percent of Americans said they supported it for people convicted of murder, according to a 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center.

In announcing the planned resumption of executions, Attorney General William Barr said last year: “We owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.”

A European Union ban on selling drugs for use in executions or torture has led to pharmaceutical companies refusing to sell such drugs to U.S. prison systems.

The Justice Department spent much of 2018 and 2019 building a secret supply chain of private companies to make and test its drug of choice, pentobarbital, which replaces the three-drug protocol used in previous executions. Some of the companies involved said they were not aware they were testing execution drugs, a Reuters investigation found last week.

As with Texas and other states, the Justice Department has commissioned a private pharmacy to make the drug.",[],521,0.9604596603960674

Mayor Park Won-soon was found dead on Friday; he left a note thanking and apologizing to “everyone.” Police did not give a cause of death but said there was no sign of foul play.

His death came days after a city official who served as Park’s secretary filed a complaint alleging the 64-year-old had sexually harassed her, prompting a police investigation.

A lawyer and rights activists who have helped the former secretary said on Monday that Park had repeatedly made unwanted physical contact with her and sent photos of himself in underwear and lurid text messages.

Reuters was unable to contact a representative of Park’s family. But the representative has issued a statement vowing legal action against those who spread “groundless statements,” without elaborating.

“Acts of forceful sexual harassment continued for four years even after she moved to a different position,” Lee Mi-kyoung, one of the activists, told a news conference. “This is a case that has a victim, and could not be covered up by his death.”

Lee also said the former secretary had reported her case to the city but officials had ignored it. A city spokesman said the report had not yet been verified and no inquiry is planned.

The funeral, hosted by the city government at the city hall and live broadcast online, was limited to around 100 people because of coronavirus concerns.

“Mourning doesn’t necessarily exclude soul-searching, but now is time to mourn,” said Paik Nak-chung, a literary critic who helped lead the funeral.

Hundreds of citizens gathered despite heavy rain near city hall and a park where Park’s body will be cremated, some weeping.

In front of city hall, one man sought to bring attention to the harassment allegations, drawing boos and complaints from supporters, local media footage showed.

Park’s remains will be buried in the southeastern county of Changnyeong, where he was born, city officials said.

As the longest-serving mayor of Seoul, a city of almost 10 million people, since 2011, Park was instrumental in its response to the coronavirus.

An outspoken advocate of women’s rights and gender equality, former activist and lawyer, he was seen as a potential presidential hopeful for the liberals in a 2022 election.

A petition filed with the presidential Blue House, urging the funeral to be cancelled over the sexual abuse allegations, gathered more than 560,000 signatures. But a court on Sunday rejected an activist group’s attempt to stop it.",[],423,0.9629772318529097

Certified music therapist Miya Adout has been busier than ever during the COVID epidemic, using music to combat the isolation and feelings of anxiety of seniors with dementia and Alzheimer’s.

In fact, two seniors residences in the GTA have continued music therapy with her team of 10 throughout, considering it essential, she told me this past week.

One, coincidentally, happens to be 147 Elder St., where my father is a resident.

Adout said one of her therapists — Carmen Lee — has played her guitar at the bedroom doorways of that facility’s residents, or in the lounge, delivering an individualized repertoire while masked.

“She’s been bringing them a lot of joy … our goal is to help them combat feelings of isolation and loneliness and depression,” said Adout, noting those feelings have “just been amplified” during the pandemic.

Adout, who opened her music therapy business five years ago, plays the guitar, piano and the drums and also sings.

She decided to work with seniors with dementia on the first day of her internship after a dementia patient started tapping her toes, moving her fingers and looking up while she played her music.

“She was completely disengaged prior, but I ended up holding her hand and singing with her,” she said. “I was just so touched that music therapy was able to bring her out in this way.”

She said that at 147 Elder, they really care for the residents’ safety, but they’re also concerned about their mental health and about safeguarding them from depression.

In fact, she said that often, as anxious as a resident may be, they “almost always” let the person with the guitar on their back perform at their rooms.

While a member of her team develops a treatment plan for every resident they work with, most of the time they are performing live music to residents.

“We are often making music with our clients … we’re singing we’re improvising,” she said. “Sometimes, we’re listening to recordings and discussing memories associated with music or reflections on the music. Other times, we’re even songwriting or composing with our clients.”

Their repertoire is always based on a client’s individual preferences, she adds.

“It’s more about what they enjoy listening to and what they remember from their youth,” she said.

For most facilities in lockdown, her team has either provided virtual therapy — such as it has done at Amica at Bronte Harbour — or are starting to do so again with group sessions.

She, or one of her therapists, appear on the senior home’s TV screen through Zoom or Google and get residents who participate to move in their seats or reflect on the music.

Adout says it’s “very common” for residents to get up and dance to the music, or if they’re confined to a wheelchair, tap their toes.

Many try to dance with other residents.

Others, classified as non-verbal and who may not even remember their own names, will begin singing, remembering the words of a particular song.

“Music therapy is very empowering and makes them feel very independent,” she said.

“Once the music begins, we find there’s so much they’re able to do, including speaking and singing.”

Many employees taking home the $2,000 monthly benefit have not been as eager to return to work. Some feel they wouldn’t make much more by returning to work while others are concerned about the health risks of leaving home.

In turn, many employers were left asking themselves: Now that we can reopen, where are our employees? Why won’t they return?

This week, Canada’s Finance Minister Bill Morneau released the nation’s fiscal and economic snapshot.

Despite its intention to the contrary, it contains a warning to all employees. If you are lucky enough to have a job, do not take it for granted and return to work. Continued dependence on the CERB may significantly weaken our job market. Employees feed our economy.

Regarding employment specifically, the fiscal snapshot contained some startling facts:

— A whopping 5.5 million Canadians (about 30% of the workforce) have been laid off, terminated or saw reduced hours because of COVID-19.

— Unemployment hit 13.7% in May; its highest level on record.

— Retail, trade, travel, entertainment, hospitality and tourism — some of which employ a greater proportion of low-wage workers, visible minorities and women — will continue to feel the impact acutely.

— Job postings remain at low levels across the nation compared to previous years.

— The working hours of mothers of young children fell proportionately more than for fathers or mothers of older children.

– Overall, more than 8 million Canadians applied for the CERB.

There are, however, some silver linings.

The report declared that Canada is doing a good job containing the pandemic. As of June 21, the seven-day incidence in daily new cases in Canada has declined by 80% from a staggering 1,730 new cases per day on April 26.

While the peak has passed Canadians, the government still warns the pandemic is far from over. To mitigate the risk, increased spending on testing, tracing and health-care capacity are priorities. This is good for workplaces.

Also, the government is planning to extend the employee wage subsidy program (CEWS) beyond August that was created to provide eligible employers with relief of up to 75% of employee compensation. While we don’t know how long the CEWS will run for, we do know the government is placing more control back into the hands of employers to create new jobs, support existing jobs and recall employees to work as soon as possible.

This fiscal snapshot is only a projection.

Forecasting is a challenge in a pandemic environment. The only sure thing is that this snapshot is a harbinger of things to come if employees don’t heed the call to action. The health of our economy is tied to employment. When employers and employees work together, only then will our job market improve.

On to your weekly COVID-19 workplace questions:

I work in Toronto and now my employer says I have to wear a mask when I didn’t have to before. Is my employer allowed to make me wear a mask?

The City of Toronto mandated the wearing of a mask or face coverings in an enclosed public space starting July 7. This includes:

– retail stores

– convenience stores

– malls, shopping plazas

– grocery stores, bakeries, farmer’s markets (enclosed areas)

– restaurants, bars (when permitted to open for indoor service)

– indoor recreational facilities, gyms, swimming pools (when permitted to open)

– libraries

– community centres

– community service agencies

– personal service settings

– churches, mosque, synagogue, temples and faith settings

– art galleries, museums, aquariums, zoos

– banquet halls, convention centres, arenas, stadiums, and other event spaces

– real estate facilities such as open houses, presentation centres

– common areas in hotels, motels and short-term rentals (e.g. lobbies, elevators, meeting rooms)

– entertainment facilities, including concert venues, theatres, cinemas, casinos

– business offices open to the public

You may be exempt if you cannot wear a mask for medical reasons. Otherwise, if you fall into a category above, you will have to wear one for the time being and can remove it for practical reasons like eating, drinking, etc.

I have worked for the same company for 36 years. Some weeks ago, the owner laid me off for “lack of work.” I applied for EI and was switched over to CERB. I found out last week that my employer has sold the company, did not tell anyone she was doing this and after 36 years I walk out the door with nothing. How do I claim severance?

If the shares of the company were sold, you would continue to be employed by the new owner. If only the assets were sold, you may already be terminated. Contact your employer right away to determine if you have a job to return to. If you hear nothing, I would suggest getting a lawyer involved to help you. Time is of the essence.

Sea Lampreys all over the Great Lakes with blood-sucking rows of teeth where their faces should be.

Is Mother Nature mad at us? Is COVID-19 clearing the way for animals to take over?

No. Appearances (and bears in Markham) notwithstanding, animal behaviour has not changed much. According to the University of Waterloo’s Dr. Michael Drescher, what’s changed is us.

Drescher says anyone lucky enough to be living near green space during the pandemic is likely paying a lot more attention to the natural world around them than in the past.

“When there is less traffic and less industrial activity, animals are fairly quick to respond to these opportunities and right now they have the chance to explore other habitats,” he said.

But no, there aren’t more wild animals turning up in urban areas.

“It’s really just that people are looking more,” Drescher said.

That’s a good thing. A new survey conducted in early June by Pollara Strategic Insights (for the International Boreal Conservation Campaign and the Indigenous Leadership Initiative) shows a majority of Canadians consider protecting nature and wildlife a priority for the government.

They also see conservation as part of building a better economy.

More than 3,000 adult Canadians were included in the poll and most said they had spent more time interacting with nature since the pandemic began.

Interacting with nature is Drescher’s work, so he knows all about that. His area of expertise includes animal behaviour and forest ecology and he investigates how things are slowly altered by climate change.

Like what?

The insect world offers some interesting examples, said Drescher.

So, never mind about tigers in Tillsonburg — turns out ticks are way scarier. They carry Lyme Disease.

“People do now have to worry about getting a tick bite,” he said. “A few decades ago, it was unheard of.”

Deer are likely involved.

“Ticks have a variety of hosts,” said Drescher. “The hypothesis is that with less-harsh winters, deer survive better and their populations increase and they can move further north. The ticks also can survive in this environment.”

Ticks can transmit Babesia, a parasite that can cause malaria-like symptoms and much worse; they can also transmit the rare viral disorder Colorado Tick Fever and the bacterial Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Untreated, Lyme itself is an insidious disease that can attack the organs and the joints.

Drescher actually had two tick-bite encounters while he did the field work for his Ph.D. in South Africa.

“So you learn to take it seriously,” he said.

He cautions people not to pull out a tick that’s securely attached. Don’t try the old lighted match trick, either, in an attempt to get the insect to withdraw. That can backfire, potentially putting even more pathogens into your body. Use tweezers or see a doctor.

Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants (tucked into your socks) if you’re going to be walking in ravines or forests. And check your body afterward for ticks.

If you have a pet that goes outside, your vet has probably spoken to you about ticks in southern Ontario. If not, you need a new vet.

Many worrying diseases are insect born, Drescher reminds us — Zika and West Nile Virus, for example. In the spirit of telling scary nature stories, he also describes Chagas disease, which involves blood-sucking bugs and their feces. Gross!

Wild tales aside, human engagement with the natural world involves a simple but crucial reciprocity, said Drescher.

“We affect the environment,” he added. “And the environment affects us.”",[],566,0.9760574658687939

Compared to late-April’s benchmark lows, system ridership has increased 45%, said TTC CEO Richard Leary in his monthly report to commissioners.

“The TTC has an important role to play in the economic restart and recovery from COVID-19,” wrote Leary in his report, on the agenda for Tuesday’s board meeting.

“Since the city has started to reopen, we’ve seen ridership increase — primarily in our bus ridership to this point.”

Indeed, weekday bus boardings the past week surpassed subways by 225,000, with the report showing 550,000 passengers riding buses compared to just 330,000 underground.

“While the subway remains the backbone of the system, our bus fleet has shown during this pandemic what we’ve always known to be true — that it’s the real workhorse in the TTC network,” he wrote.

As the city transitioned into its second stage of pandemic recovery, the TTC relaxed its COVID-19 protection measures on July 2 — again allowing riders to board buses via the front door, and resumed collection of cash, ticket and token fares, as well as paper transfers.

While more people were riding buses, the subway system saw the steepest growth compared to surface routes — up 58% from the April 26 to May 6, 2020 baseline.

The comparatively robust bus ridership increased 39% across the same time period, and streetcar boardings increased by 36%.

Buses have been top-of-mind by both those at TTC headquarters and city hall.

Last week, Mayor John Tory unveiled the first leg of a five-part plan to roll out bus priority lanes across some of the city’s most congested surface routes.

Starting with an 8.5-kilometre stretch along Eglinton Ave. E., Kingston Rd. and Morningside Ave., in Scarborough, the lanes will maintain increasing ridership numbers across fewer vehicles.

Between May 3 and May 30, the TTC served 6,529,000 riders — an average of 1.6-million per week.

That’s nearly 34-million below the 2020 budget of 40.5-million rides for the same time period, and 33-million below last year.

Year-to-date, ridership trails far behind budget — 130-million rides so far in 2020 compared to an expected 217-million, and 85-million fewer than 2019.

Reduced monthly pass and child travel equated to about six million lost rides, the report reads.

In May, TTC CFO Josie La Vita said COVID-19 related revenue losses and cost overruns are causing a $92-million per month shortfall — with the service standing to lose up to $520 million between then and Labour Day.

“Ridership is expected to rise, but marginally as the city remains in a state of emergency,” the report reads. “Even after the emergency measures are lifted, it is expected that ridership will take time to recover to its pre-COVID-19 levels.”

Paramedics responded to the stabbing call in an apartment at a building near Finch Ave. and Weston Rd. around 10:15 a.m.

“We had a report of a stabbing of a male and female child,” EMS Deputy Com. Evert Steenge said Saturday. “They were taken to hospital in serious condition.”

The seriously injured toddlers were taken to Sick Kids hospital via an emergency run. But both kids are expected to survive.

Toronto Police Const. Alex Li said the victims are a one-year-old girl and a four-year-old boy who were located inside an apartment building.

“I can confirm we have one person (an adult woman) in custody we believe is responsible for the stabbing,” he said.

The woman in custody is reportedly the mother of the children.

Early Saturday night, police said a 36-year-old woman has been charged with two counts of attempted murder, two counts of aggravated assault and two counts of assault.

With the pandemic’s sudden arrival, scores of people found themselves abruptly out of work. In an expensive city like Toronto, those already on the edge and barely scraping by were hit the hardest.

In the heavy days following the emergency declaration — when the reality of what was before us was only just beginning to sink in — the emails didn’t stop coming.

In these “unprecedented times,” banks, cell phone providers, car companies, even utility companies were coming out of the woodwork to declare their solidarity and support by adjusting rates, waiving late-payment fees and offering deferral options. It’s not an exaggeration to say that fear and uncertainty were everywhere, even for those of us with secure jobs and savings to sustain us.

All levels of government were scrambling to figure out how to cushion the blow.

For those living paycheck-to-paycheck while employed in fields and industries effectively shuttered until further notice, the shutdown was disastrous.

On March 26 when asked what he would say to Ontarians worrying about how they’d make rent in a few days, Premier Doug Ford said this: “If you have a choice between putting food on your table or paying rent, you’re putting food on your table. The government of Ontario will make sure that no one gets evicted. We stand by that and we’re gonna make sure we take care of those people.”

And with that came a provincial moratorium on evictions for non-payment of rent. Problem solved?

Well, no. Not if you’re an out-of-work tenant, grateful for the temporary relief but wondering how on earth you will be able to pay rent without income, let alone begin to face the months of accrued back-rent once the moratorium is lifted.

Certainly not if you’re a landlord being asked to work in good faith with your tenants to land on a payment plan, while simultaneously having to wonder if the tenant in question is truly unable to pay or simply feels they shouldn’t have to. After all, your overhead and operating expenses remain the same.

An impending crisis was plainly identified, but in the months that followed a true solution never materialized. As government stimulus money flowed and the Canada’s Emergency Relief Benefit cheques rolled out, presumably the thinking was that besieged tenants could now keep up but that presupposes that everyone qualified, and that there weren’t other expenses — food, medicine, family needing emergency assistance — that took precedence.

An important additional layer to all of this is the fact that the data shows that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Toronto’s low-income Black communities in the northwest corner of the city, many of the very same communities already historically overrepresented in the eviction applications presented to the Landlord Tenant Board. Particularly in light of the current societal reckoning drawing our awareness to the insidious nature of institutionalized racism, this connection cannot be ignored.

So, what now?

Well, for starters, Bill 134, the “Protecting Tenants and Strengthening Community Housing Act,” already in the works prior to the pandemic, is on the verge of coming into effect and that could well be the match that lights this powder keg.

Purportedly designed to address the significant backlog at the Landlord Tenant Board by streamlining and expediting the hearing process, tenants’ rights advocates are ringing the alarm that things are about to get even worse for the already vulnerable.

Among a number of changes intended to introduce efficiencies, most relevant is that any tenant who defaults on a payment arrangement could face immediate eviction without a hearing. So, in practical terms, what that means is that the tenant who fell behind in April but promised to catch up in June — when we all assumed life would have surely returned to some form of normalcy — has no mechanism available to them to facilitate revisiting that payment arrangement. If they fail to honour it by even a few dollars, they can be out on the street.

On the flip side, landlords are not all faceless corporate entities — just as many are smaller-scale investors who might own a few condos as long-term investments which they lease out to offset the carrying costs. They are likely already feeling the impacts of the “COVID recession” and not receiving that rent could be equally damaging.

Recognizing that the stakes are incredibly high, with homelessness already a crisis in our city, it is critical that the same government who identified the moral imperative to freeze evictions and protect its citizens from the economic fallout of a global pandemic now sees it through.

Hitting pause wasn’t enough. We need a solution.

As we all brace for the distinct possibility of a second wave come fall, it seems obvious that if the solution is to stay safe and stay home, doing all we can to keep people in their homes is paramount.

So Toronto family law firm Shulman & Partners LLP, which has experienced a 40% rise in people seeking to split from their spouses since pre-COVID-19, are recommending out-of-court settlements through arbitration and mediation.

“For me as a lawyer, court is always the last resort,” says Diana Isaac, a partner at Shulman & Partners LLP, and a 10-year veteran of practising family law.

“We always try to settle matters and negotiate them because it’s more cost-effective, it’s less emotionally draining for people, and it’s lot more expedient. So talking about mediation, arbitration, as we call it, an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, works really well for people who a) want this done quickly and b) with you may not be very far apart in your positions. So if we want to maintain the matter and we want to have good faith discussions and some sort of resolution, mediation is a great option. And a lot of people are gravitating towards this because it’s also private. It’s not in the public realm where your information is put into a court system.”

Isaac says Shulman & Partners’s top-five pieces of advice to resolving a divorce or separation outside of court are:

— Remember the pandemic: “These are unprecedented times. We appreciate that changes in the parenting schedule or the financial situation will be temporary and they may be short-lived.”

— Be flexible: “I think in order to keep conflict down and to avoid increased legal costs we have to come up with a solution that makes sense for both parties. So if someone has lost their job during the pandemic, it may make sense to have some sort of temporary arrangement in the interim rather than going to court and saying, ‘I insist that the status quo be maintained.”

— Choose your lawyer wisely: “Having a good fit with that individual is important. Someone that matches and is able to understand what’s important to you. What are your goals and what are your expectations? I think that makes a real difference.”

— Keeping an open mind: “No matter what the situation but especially during a pandemic. And that sometimes coming up with a solution and avoiding court may be a win-win situation. Sometimes in court there’s a winner and a loser but at that point, people are emotionally drained, people have expended significant funds.”

— Talk to each other: “Communication is so pivotal in cases. And I think more and more it’s important. Yes, we are physical distancing, but I think the communication with your partner is very important at this time. Keep each other apprised as to child-related issues is very important and doing it in a way that is respected, that is civil, and in cases involving children, are child-oriented, is very important. Not adding adult conflict and being civil will take you a long way in these times.”",[],502,0.9519354734431481

Unfortunately, this requires naming the involved songs — Tears Are Not Enough; We Are The World — so get ready for weeks of ear-worm.

One or both tunes will now play non-stop in your head for a month.

Sorry.

Those songs and the resultant albums, music videos and documentaries ensured that for all of 1985 these charitable supergroups hogged the headlines.

The Americans went first, recording We Are The World in January of 1985.

The gathering of top recording artists, calling themselves USA for Africa, was an initiative to raise money for famine relief; included were Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner, Ray Charles, Bill Joel, Willie Nelson and dozens of others.

We Are The World was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie and produced by Quincy Jones and Michael Omartian.

Also at the U.S. recording session was Bob Geldof, who had spearheaded the British gathering that got the ball rolling. In late 1984, Geldof corralled a who’s who of U.K. artists to do a benefit recording for famine relief in Ethiopia.

The large group, which called itself Band Aid, included the usual suspects: Bono, Sting, Boy George, various Duran Duran, Boomtown Rats and Spandau Ballet members, George Michael, Phil Collins, etc.

Other big names — David Bowie and Paul McCartney, for example — couldn’t attend the recording session but added messages later.

Geldof and Midge Ure wrote Do They Know It’s Christmas, got it recorded and released it in December 1984. The song made millions for famine relief.

Harry Belafonte then got a similar project started in the U.S. and it eventually became USA for Africa and We Are The World.

What it was like to wrangle all those superstars at once in an all-night session? Quincy Jones uses the phrase, “Like running through hell with gasoline drawers on,” in an excellent recent Rolling Stone story about the events of 35 years ago.

About two weeks after the American session, the Canadians had their turn.

It was a less fraught undertaking — politeness is our national identity — held at Toronto’s Manta Sound on Sunday, Feb. 10.

Produced by David (“I’ve been an a**hole a lot,”) Foster, the single was written by Foster and Bryan Adams and about 50 well-known Canadian artists got together to sing it.

The wildest part about looking at the recording session now is seeing how young everyone is — Gordon Lightfoot, Anne Murray, Burton Cummings, Joni Mitchell, Ronnie Hawkins. Corey Hart looks like a baby.

(Having been at that session, one memory that stands out is Anne Murray singing her solo line. She was note-perfect on the first take and people were impressed.

Everyone: Wow!l

Anne Murray: Oh, pshaw.)

The musicians seem to have been grouped, inadvertently or otherwise, according to a fame pecking order that to them must have felt a lot like being back in high school.

Gordon Lightfoot had the honour of singing the first line. If they were making this thing today, that probably wouldn’t change.

The passage of time has altered other reputations, though, and mostly in the burnishing; Joni Mitchell and Neil Young were already big stars, for example, but neither had achieved sainthood yet.

Context? Drake and Justin Bieber weren’t born yet. Neither was Taylor Swift. NWA was three years away from releasing a first album. The Tragically Hip was four years away from their first album. Beyonce was a toddler. There was no internet. Home computers were rare. A few people had car phones but otherwise there were no cell phones. Imagine getting all those famous folk to show up using land lines.

It was an amazing bit of cooperation and coming together for charity. As Geddy Lee said at the time, “It’s 50 lead singers pretending they’re a chorus.”

The end result was a lot of money for charity.

Could such a collegial event ever happen today?

The news was predictably grim.

According to forecasts, all provinces will run large deficits this year. And Ontario’s deficit this year (relative to the size of the provincial economy) will be larger than at any point in the last 25 years.

When the COVID public health and economic crisis ends, the Ford government will face an even worse fiscal situation than when they took office. How bad is Ontario’s fiscal outlook?

The Ford government published its budget in mid-March, forecasting a $20.5-billion deficit, the largest nominal deficit in provincial history. Unfortunately, that was overly optimistic. Now, according to new forecasts, the government will collect about $5 billion less.

The government’s fiscal plan, however, included substantial contingencies (an accounting buffer), which would partially offset lower-than-forecasted revenues. Subsequently, RBC Economics now estimates Ontario’s deficit could exceed $21 billion this year.

With its buffer gone, any further bad news on the revenue side — or additional unplanned spending — will cause Ontario’s deficit to grow even larger. But the bad news just keeps coming.

In addition to a larger deficit, Ontario potentially faces a steep recession. According to recent forecasts, Ontario’s economy will shrink 4.2% this year. These two factors combined — a large deficit and a recession — mean Ontario’s long-standing fiscal mess will quickly get much worse.

Consider this: Ontario’s debt-to-GDP ratio (the best measure of debt sustainability) is forecasted to grow from 40% to 46%, the highest level in provincial history.

These problems can’t be solved overnight, especially during a pandemic and recession. The Ford government’s top priority should be helping the province weather the COVID public health and economic crises. However, once these have passed, Ontario’s government must exercise fiscal discipline — for a long time — to repair the damage.

Which raises the key question: Will the Ford government actually do the hard work to reduce Ontario’s debt burden when the recession ends? Only time will tell. But if it does, Ontarians will see a marked change from the policies of this government’s predecessors.

In the years following the 2008-09 recession, when Ontario’s deficit ballooned, the McGuinty and Wynne governments allowed large deficits to persist, which caused government debt to accumulate quickly. In the wake of today’s recession, to not repeat recent history, the Ford government must take active steps to reform and reduce government spending.

If, however, the Ford government — like its predecessors — continues to steadily increase nominal spending while hoping for larger revenue gains to shrink the deficit, it will likely produce similar results, namely more red ink.

The Ford government is not responsible for the current recession nor its effects on provincial finances. Still, once the recession is over, it will be the Ford government’s responsibility to clean up the mess. Doing this — quickly — will help the province prosper in the long-run and will reduce the size of the debt burden to be passed along to future generations of Ontarians.

If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s latest legislation against assault weapons really is the first salvo in a campaign to take away every last gun, then you’re on your own.

When Toronto Mayor John Tory and his Calgary counterpart, Nahead Nenshi, ban shooting ranges, it’s your fight.

It wasn’t always this way.

If I am to be labeled a “liberal,” then I was one of the rare ones willing to stand by you. I live in possibly the greatest concentration of left leaners in the country.

I am a bike riding, Chardonnay swilling, Toronto downtowner. I have also spent the last 20 years of my career writing and radio broadcasting and I have always defended the rights of gun owners. No more.

I’m done with your hectoring and condescension. I’m through with your paranoia.

I don’t need to be lectured on a constitutional amendment from another country. The fact that I don’t own a gun is immaterial. That I live in an urban setting doesn’t mean I don’t understand a farmer’s need for a firearm for pest control.

I support gun rights for hunters and target shooters. I don't know why anyone needs automatic weapons. — John Moore (@MooreintheAM) May 1, 2020

I also don’t need the patronizing reminders about how it’s not “a weapon.”

This new indifference stems from a tweet I posted on May 1 that read: “I support gun rights for hunters and target shooters. I don’t know why anyone needs automatic weapons.”

A pretty rare endorsement from a guy who lives in the most liberal North American city outside of San Francisco.

But this brought on such a torrent of abusive tweets my Twitter feed started to look like one of the screens from the Matrix.

Many dwelled on my use of the word “automatic” with tart dispositions about the intricacies of different guns. Ok, I get it. I should have said “assault.”

I don’t have a PhD in guns but you likely don’t have a degree in economics and yet I’m sure you have views on the federal budget.

NO small number of people said “automatic” guns are already banned in Canada. In which case, why the outrage? If Trudeau and Blair are banning something that is already banned, let’s all go back to bed.

I’ll set aside those who called me a “libtard.”

I may not be an expert in guns but I have fired one. I have a policy of trying pretty well everything and if I was going to talk about guns on my radio show (which is in a city where the mayor wants to ban ALL guns), then I thought I should go to a gun range.

My friend, Becky Coles, and her father, John, took me to an indoor range. They taught me to load the magazine of a CZ 75 Compact.

John instructed me on aiming, trigger pressure and recoil. I fired maybe 100 shots. Like most first-timers, I had some good luck. I get that the skill and the thrill are in replicating the good shots.

It was not an experience I care to repeat. I’m just not a gun person. Becky and John have no interest in my hobbies of cycling and golfing.

But that’s the difference. I understand that target shooting is a hobby not a personality disorder. I support hunting (so long as you eat what you kill). I’m not one of those urban snobs who calls gun owners “nutters” or wants to ban ranges or compel people to store their weapons at the range (like many, John and Becky go to different ones).

I do want sensible gun laws. As a matter of fact, even an overwhelming majority of gun owners have few issues with gun storage and transportation laws. They know they reduce the incidence of suicide, accidents and guns falling into criminal hands.

Perhaps, the cohort of angry gun owners is small. I can’t tell. But I don’t need their stress-inducing insults and tirades.

Gun owners, you had an ally but you’re on your own now.

The President Donald Trump-hating comedian Bill Maher, in 2018, openly rooted for a recession, if its price meant the defeat of Trump in 2020. Maher said: “By the way, I’m hoping for it because one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy. So please, bring on the recession… Sorry if that hurts people but it’s either root for a recession or you lose your democracy… I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point.”

Similarly, only days ago, a cable host touted the coronavirus’ “silver lining,” that the crisis, or, more specifically, Trump’s alleged poor handling of it, politically damages the president. MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace said: “There is something both tragic, and pathetic, and ironic about the fact that it took a, you know, colour-blind, gender-blind, you know, state-line-blind virus to sort of have all of the president’s sins from his first three years catch up with him. You can’t stand there and lie… And I wonder what you think about whether or not there’s some silver lining there, that some of the things that, that we’ve been talking about for three years may be finally catching up with him?”

“Silver lining”?

The anti-Trump narrative, of course, is that he botched the handling of this crisis, and that but for his inattentiveness, America would not have over 1 million coronavirus cases. This means the worse things get, the greater the chance of Trump’s defeat in November.

This perhaps explains the math of Wallace’s MSNBC colleague, Rachel Maddow. Maddow, on April 21, said: “These are the top five largest outbreaks on Earth. Number five is Germany, with just under 150,000 cases as of today. Number four is France, just under 160,000 cases. Number three is Italy. Number two is Spain with just over 200,000 cases. And then there’s us — USA. USA, biggest outbreak in the world, with over 800,000 cases now. We have more coronavirus cases than all of the other top five countries combined.”

First, does anyone really believe the number is coming out of China, a nation of nearly 1.5 billion and where the outbreak started? The Chinese government lied repeatedly about the origin of the virus, about its transmissibility and, no doubt, about its number of cases.

Second, as of April 21, 2020, the total of the next five countries exceeded our number. The number of confirmed cases, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, was as follows: Spain 200,210; Italy 181,228; France 155,383; Germany 146,653; and the United Kingdom 124,743. That comes to 808,217, versus the USA at 786,566.

Third, how about a little perspective? Spain had 207,634 cases, versus our 931,698 cases. But its population is 47 million. Ours is 330 million, or seven times bigger. Multiply Spain’s number times seven, and that would be over 1.4 million, making Spain’s numbers, when adjusted for population, far worse than America’s. Likewise, Italy’s population is 60 million, making the U.S. population 5.5 times bigger. Multiply Italy’s 181,228 coronavirus cases by 5.5, and that comes to almost 1 million cases, making Italy worse than we were.

What about deaths? As of that date, the total deaths of the five most stricken countries outside the U.S. comes to 86,446, versus our 42,201.

What is it with Democrats, the left-wing media and arithmetic? Joe Biden once talked about President Barack Obama’s “three-letter” program, “Jobs. J.O.B.S.” During one of the Democratic debates, Biden said: “150 million people have been killed since 2007, when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability. More than all wars, including Vietnam, from that point on.”

“150 million”? That’s nearly half the population of America.

And consider MSNBC’s Brian Williams’ analysis of Mike Bloomberg giving every American $1 million, rather than spending $500 million to get elected president. Williams, with a New York Times reporter nodding at his side, said: “When I read (this tweet) tonight on social media, it kind of all became clear. ‘Bloomberg spent $500 million on ads. U.S. population, 327 million.’ Don’t tell us if you’re ahead of us on the math. ‘He could have given each American $1 million and have had lunch money left over.’ It’s an incredible way of putting it.” Actually, Bloomberg’s $500 million, at $1 million per American, would have gifted exactly 500 of us.

The country is facing a pandemic that has, so far, killed about 60,000 Americans, with many experts expecting a vaccine a year to 18 months from now, if then. But rest assured, say the Trump-haters, the sacrifice the sick and the dead have made were not in vain. There is a “silver lining.” Trump may go down in November.

Much more than a statistic, that total represents mothers, fathers, grandparents and children.

Every single one of those lives has a story to tell and hopefully, someone left behind to tell it for them.

Yet in battling this deadly pandemic, statistics are important and having the right information is key to stopping future fatalities and ultimately stopping the spread of the virus until we have a vaccine.

So, do we have the right data?

The real answer is that we have the best data available to us, but it is far from complete and far from uniform.

Each province has determined its own way to count COVID-19 deaths and even within provinces –such as Ontario with 34 individual health units — what information is provided is not always complete.

My decision to look into this came after a revealing tweet from Toronto Public Health. From the beginning of the pandemic, I’ve heard claims that COVID death counts include people who died with the coronavirus in their system but not necessarily from COVID-19.

“Individuals who have died with COVID-19, but not as a result of COVID-19 are included in the case counts for COVID-19 deaths in Toronto,” TPH tweeted in reply to a question on the issue.

To me that sounds like we may be inflating our COVID-19 death count. Was this the case across Ontario? Was this the case across Canada?

I reached out to local public health units across Ontario and found out that was the case; someone who was infected when they died was considered a COVID death even if they may have died of another cause.

“A death that occurs in an active case of COVID-19 is counted as a COVID-19 death. COVID-19 cases marked as fatal are included in the public health reporting databases whether or not COVID-19 was determined to be a contributing or underlying cause of death,” said Public Health Ontario.

What about other provinces?

In addition to those in Ontario, I reached out to officials in Quebec — the province hardest hit –Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.

All but Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan got back to me with the rationale for their individual provincial decisions. With 63 deaths, Nova Scotia has the highest death count in Atlantic Canada, Saskatchewan suffered a total of 15 deaths.

The actions of provinces and territories with the lowest death counts would be negligible in looking into this matter. Newfoundland and Labrador recorded just three deaths, New Brunswick two and Prince Edward Island and the territories have none.

In the other provinces that responded, every single one will record a death if the person died while still infected with COVID-19. Quebec’s health ministry went so far as to say health officials in that province would count a COVID death on someone who had not been tested.

A spokesperson for the Quebec health ministry told be via email that a COVID death was possible if, “the person had clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 before his death without having had a test to confirm COVID-19.”

Each province may vary slightly in how they word their policy but it boils down to the same end result: COVID-19 doesn’t need to be present for a COVID death to be added to the count. Outside of trauma or some other unnatural cause, the infected person is marked as dying from the virus.

Only Alberta, home to 160 COVID deaths as of this weekend, told me that they have and will remove deaths if a different cause is found.

“If there is any question, we count the case as a COVID-19 death and then have the death certificate and file reviewed,” an Alberta health official told me.

So far Alberta has removed five deaths from their COVID count after review.

Are we counting people who should not be counted as having died from COVID-19?

That may be happening but as one Ontario health official told me, the province wanted to be as forthcoming as possible when reporting public numbers. Deaths that occur due to natural causes at a person’s home or even a nursing home are not reviewed by the coroner’s office.

Determining exactly which illness resulted in the death would be difficult and Ontario, like the other provinces, decided it would rather be accused of over-reporting after the fact than accused of downplaying the number of deaths from a very serious virus.

So what percentage of COVID-19 deaths could possibly be due to a different factor?

According to an Ontario study of all cases between January 15 and May 15, 36.8% of all COVID-19 deaths in the province had at least one comorbidity or underlying condition. The most common of which was cardiovascular disease at 19.5%.

People skeptical of any government numbers surrounding the coronavirus will be quick to jump up and say, “See, they died of a heart attack, not this fake virus!”

Not so fast.

Someone with a heart condition may have had a heart attack but health officials stress that COVID-19 puts enormous stress on the system of someone already dealing with cardiovascular issues. At that point, the virus did contribute to the death by bringing on the heart attack.

“We are never going to be precise in the COVID death toll, but the inability to monitor death by cause in real time in Canada has emerged as an important gap in our public health information systems,” said Dr. Fisman, an epidemiologist with the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto.

Fisman believes that we may be missing COVID deaths due to a lack of testing.

“Misclassification likely still represents an undercount due to people dying with or from COVID without testing,” Dr. Fisman said.

One of the metrics that he and other scientists are turning to is excess mortality, looking at how many more people died this year compared to past years.

“Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta all recorded some degree of excess mortality in the weeks since March 11, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic,” Statistics Canada said on June 19.

The study looked at deaths up until May 2 but did not include any data from Ontario because it was not available at the time.

Bottom line, we won’t know the exact death count from COVID-19, knowing those who died with it versus those who died from it, due to a lack of data. The idea, though, that health officials are falsely boosting the numbers in Canada isn’t borne out.

Determining exactly why someone with one or more underlying conditions died while infected with COVID-19 is a difficult task, made more difficult by how the virus adds stress to an already ill person. What we have is the best information available to us at the time.

Perhaps we could improve our data collection for the future, but that is another discussion completely.

How the provinces define a COVID-19 death

Quebec

In Quebec, COVID deaths are compiled for anyone who dies when they are considered infected with COVID, regardless of whether that person may have preexisting conditions.

Two types of “COVID deaths” are possible: The deceased had received a positive result from COVID-19 before his death; or the person had clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 before his death without having had a test to confirm COVID-19

Ontario

A death that occurs in an active case of COVID-19 is counted as a COVID-19 death. COVID-19 cases marked as fatal are included in public health reporting databases whether or not COVID-19 was determined to be a contributing or underlying cause of death.

Manitoba

A COVID death is counted if it results from a clinically compatible illness, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to the virus (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death.

Alberta

Alberta counts a COVID death when a person is diagnosed with COVID-19 or if COVID-19 is considered as a contributing cause of death. If there is any question, health officials count the case as a COVID-19 death and then have the death certificate and file reviewed (this is why we sometimes remove announced deaths after the fact).

British Columbia

British Columbia counts COVID deaths in individuals who have been diagnosed with the virus and die during the course of their illness.

Deaths that are unnatural or sudden and unexpected must be reported to a coroner in B.C., but this does not typically include deaths from known disease or natural occurrences.

That said, if the cause of death cannot be reasonably established through examination of the body, scene and history, additional post-mortem investigations will be undertaken.

How Canada compares to other countries

The 8,773 deaths Canada has suffered puts us at the 14th highest death count in the world, just slightly behind 13th placed Germany (9,070 deaths), but well ahead of 15th placed Chile (6,818 deaths). When looked at as deaths per 100,000 of population, Canada falls to 17th place (23.79 deaths per 100,000). That compares to tiny San Marino in first place (124.3 deaths per 100,00), while Britain captured fourth spot (67.5 deaths per 100,000) and the United States came in ninth (41.2 deaths per 100,000).

The Ontario government has already banned dancing and singing on patios, and a source said it’s still undecided on whether dance club-style bars will be allowed to reopen with most other businesses in Stage 3 of the economic recovery plan.

At this point, it’s expected that bars that also offer food service will be part of Stage 3, a phase Premier Doug Ford hinted could come shortly.

But even if the province green lights a return to pubs or clubs, local municipal public health officials could still say no.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto’s Associate Medical Officer of Health, said the city has helped restaurants and bars expand their outdoor spaces where possible, as COVID-19 is known to spread more easily indoors for reasons such as difficulty maintaining physical distancing, less ventilation and higher risk of contamination on surfaces.

“While COVID-19 case numbers have decreased in Toronto, new infections are still being reported each day,” Dr. Dubey said in an email. “We are seeing more younger adults getting COVID-19 compared to earlier in the outbreak when there were many residents in long-term care homes who were getting COVID-19. This means we still need to be careful. This point is made very clear in the experiences of other jurisdictions.”

Yes, very clear.

Quebec allowed its bars to reopen in late June, but this week imposed new restrictions and threatened to close them again after dozens of COVID-19 cases were linked to watering holes.

As of Friday, Quebec imposed new restrictions on bars — no dancing, no drinking standing up and a midnight last call which is three hours earlier than normal.

Nightclubs and bars across the United States reopened to the public only to be told to shutter their doors as COVID-19 cases soared.

Emily Hogeveen, a spokesperson for Ontario Finance Minister Rod Phillips, said in an email that venues for large public gatherings such as night clubs continue to be restricted under Stage 2 of the ‘Framework for Reopening Our Province.’

Restaurants and bars were allowed to operate outdoor patios as part of the current Stage 2 provided they follow guidelines such as mandatory reservations and spacing between tables, she said.

“Based on public health advice and the best practices and lessons learned from Stage 2, Stage 3 will focus on reopening the remaining workplaces and community spaces, while carefully and gradually lifting restrictions,” Hogeveen said. “Public health measures and workplace safety guidance will remain in place and available.”

The Ontario government has yet to say definitively what will reopen in Stage 3, and the reclosing or tightening up of bars in other jurisdictions is likely to give province public health officials pause.

“We just want to be cautious,” Ford said Friday. “But eventually we have to open up the bars. We have to open up restaurants inside. We have to get people back to work.”

Tony Elenis, president and CEO of the Ontario Restaurant Hotel and Motel Association (ORHMA), said the hospitality industry believes it’s ready for a return of customers.

The sector expects there will be special restrictions on bars — customers won’t be allowed to drink standing up or congregate around the bar.

When patios were reopened, live music wasn’t allowed because of the possibility of airborne droplets from the singing but also due to the tendency of patrons to get closer to each other to talk, he said.

Bars should have their own set of safety rules, but operators are capable of implementing them, he said.

For instance, large bars typically have security guards at the door, he said.

Restaurants, hotels and bars have taken a large financial hit, he said.

“Looking around, it is the last hospitality concept along with large concerts that seems to open,” Elenis said. “All we’re saying is that the industry is ready to open, and it’s ready to open with safety in mind.

“The frightening thing, and the worrisome thing, is that as the crisis stabilizes, and the economy stabilizes and starts to show growth, the hospitality industry is not — the restaurants are not, the bars are not — and that’s the issue,” he said.

Halton Regional Police say gunfire erupted in a plaza at 484 Plains Rd. E., west of King Rd., just after 1 p.m.

Officers arrived at the scene and located one man dead and a second victim injured.

The injured person, whose identity has not been released, was taken to the hospital for treatment.

The dead man has been identified by police as Pasquale “Pat” Musitano, 52, of Hamilton.

A longtime fixture of Ontario’s crime underworld, Pat Musitano was nearly killed on April 25, 2019, when he was shot four times — including once in the head — as he left his lawyer’s office in Mississauga around 7 a.m.

He spent nearly two weeks in hospital recovering from critical injuries.

But months before that shooting, journalist and longtime Mafia observer James Dubro told the Toronto Sun he believed Pat Musitano’s days were numbered.

“His career has been very violent and undiplomatic, even for a Mafia boss,” Dubro said. “He’s been a marked man and has been finished as an effective ‘Ndrangheta cell leader in Hamilton and the GTA for some time.”

Pat Musitano’s vehicle was torched in the driveway of his home in 2015.

In may 2017 his younger brother Angelo Musitano was gunned down in his pick-up truck as he pulled into the driveway of his Waterdown in broad daylight.

Pat Musitano’s house was sprayed by bullets two weeks later.

The Musitano brothers were behind the 1997 gangland hit on mob kingpin Johnny “Pops” Papalia and his underboss Carmen Barillaro.

They pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in Barillaro’s death while the charges for Papalia’s death were withdrawn. Pat and Angelo were sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2006 but they were released in 2006.

In the wake of Pat Musitano’s killing, Halton cops say one male was seen fleeing the scene west on Plains Rd. E. in a grey, four-door sedan, similar to an Infiniti Q50, with a sunroof.

“This vehicle will have fresh damage to the driver’s side in the area of the doors,” police said.

No suspect description was immediately released.

Anyone with information regarding this double shooting, the whereabouts of the suspect vehicle, or who has dashcam that may help investigators, is urged to call police at 905-825-4777 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).

And when we issued the call for help in the fight against COVID-19, they answered.

Through our Ontario Together web portal, we received thousands of submissions from companies eager to retool their operations and supply Ontario’s front lines with much-needed equipment and supplies.

As a result, more than 18,000 emergency supply leads have been converted into $658 million in purchases of critical supplies and equipment to support staff on the front lines, including more than 26 million gowns, more than 175 million gloves, and over 123 million masks.

Our manufacturing sector stood up for the people of Ontario, and now it’s time that we stand up for them.

A recent poll found that 73% of Ontarians already wanted to buy Canadian-made products and more than half said they would increase their efforts to find local goods more often due to COVID-19. With the hardworking men and women of our province manufacturing everything from baby wipes to barbecues, cosmetic products to cars, supporting made-at-home products will be essential for building a strong, self-sufficient province.

The desire to support Ontario businesses is there — people just need the right information to do it. That’s why our government is proud to support the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters to launch “Ontario Made,” to make it easier than ever before to buy Ontario products.

Consumers will soon be able to find the “Ontario Made” logo on goods sold across the province. A new website, SupportOntarioMade.ca, will directly connect consumers and supply-chain partners to Ontario manufacturers. You’ll see more about Ontario Made on social media.

In times of crisis, it’s the Ontario Spirit, our commitment to look out for one another, that will always carry us through. Supporting our manufacturing sector here at home will not only boost our recovery and create jobs, it will also ensure that we have the factories, plants and assembly lines we need to respond when called upon again.

As we have every step of the way, we are once again asking the people of Ontario to do their part — look for the Ontario Made logo, and support Ontario manufacturing. We hope you’ll be a part of it.

Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams said both situations present a significant risk of COVID-19 spread.

The province’s public health measures team is looking at sporting and concert venues and whether any measures such as masking can protect against exposure, he said.

“As you imagine, at a concert or at a sports venue with people yelling and cheering, there is a lot of droplets spread … so they are certainly high-risk settings especially because you can’t tell who’s actually going to buy the ticket and seat next to you,” Williams said. “So we’d have to be persuaded there’s some way you could do it with separation.”

However, creating enough space between members of the audience might be physically impossible in some venues or too unprofitable, he said.

Public health officials are open to any suggestions, but remain convinced these types of events are high risk, Williams said.

The chief medical officer preached similar caution around reopening of the border to non-essential travel, calling the escalating number of cases in the U.S. “very concerning.”

U.S. congress members with the Northern Border Caucus are pushing both countries to develop a framework for a phased reopening.

While the border is a federal responsibility, Premier Doug Ford has opposed any move to date to reopen the border.

“I get a sense from overall, there’s not a lot of eagerness to open up, because that’s really what got us into trouble back in March,” Williams said, referring to travel-related COVID-19 cases. “If we’re going to do any more travel allowance, we’re going to have to have a very rigorous screening and monitoring process in place because you saw some problems already just recently in P.E.I. and Nova Scotia that was related to that.

“So it’s a wakeup call to say, you can’t be too careful on this matter,” he added.

Ontario reported a spike in of 170 new cases Thursday, with 36,348 confirmed cases in total.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said 86 of the new cases were discovered through targeted testing of temporary farm workers in Windsor-Essex.

Outside of the sequestered farm outbreaks, the province had less than 100 new cases — a positive sign, Williams said.

“The numbers in the hospitals are coming down,” Williams said. “So again, metrics improving there.”

Three more deaths brought the number of lives lost to the pandemic to 2,703.

Williams pointed out the province was down to 25 COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care homes Thursday with 289 now considered resolved.

The percentage of new cases in Ontarians aged 60 years and up is on a notable decline, and young and middle-aged adults have become a larger percentage of COVID-19 cases over the past week, Williams said.

The ban, introduced in March, has been extended several times and is due to expire on July 21. The measure does not include trade.

Infections have risen rapidly in about 40 of the 50 U.S. states over the last two weeks, according to a Reuters analysis, and the premiers of major Canadian provinces say the frontier must remain shut.

Although some U.S. politicians in northern states are pressing for the measures to be relaxed, the Ottawa sources said the extension was virtually inevitable given the seriousness of the crisis in the United States.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier told reporters talks between the two nations on the ban were continuing and said “We will have more to say later this week, I’m sure.”

Doug Ford, premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, on Monday said the situation in Florida was “staggering” and “scary.”

The chief medical officer in the Pacific province of British Columbia said last week there was no chance of non-essential travel with the United States this summer, given how widespread the virus was south of the border.

Trudeau said on July 8 that Canada had handled the outbreak better than the United States, in a rare public comment on the faltering U.S. effort.

The United States – which has a population almost nine times larger than Canada’s – has recorded more than 135,000 deaths compared to 8,783 in Canada.

The agency previously reported that year-over-year inflation declined by 0.2 per cent in April, then took a further drop of 0.4 per cent in May as lockdowns put a damper on consumer spending.

But a look under the headline figures showed consumers were spending more on items that don’t weigh as much in the consumer price index, which tracks inflation.

And they were spending less on things that weigh more in the calculation, such as gasoline.

In a numbers experiment to better reflect pandemic spending, Statistics Canada found the annualized inflation figures for April and May would have been 0.0 and -0.1 per cent.

Those are some of the policies Conservative leadership candidate Erin O’Toole is saying he would enact as prime minister.

If Canada, under Justin Trudeau, has adopted a policy of appeasements towards China, O’Toole is proposing an aggressive defence of Canadian interests.

“Trudeau’s approach to China has been an abject failure,” O’Toole’s just released policy paper on China reads.

“After revealing how much he admired the regime’s dictatorship, he spent his first years in office in a futile bid for a free trade deal at the expense of Indo Pacific partners, and an extradition treaty at the expense of Canadians, particularly Chinese Canadians.”

That’s all well and good to criticize Trudeau, and on China that is easy to do. The real question is what would O’Toole, or any Conservative leader do differently.

Specifically, what would they do to secure the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, now held for 582 days in Chinese jails.

O’Toole says he’d give the Chinese government an ultimatum to release Kovrig and Spavor or face economic and Magnitsky Act type sanctions.

“If they are not released within 30 days, key leaders starting with the President, Premier of the State council, the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Party Congress and the President of the Supreme People’s Court would be subject to Canadian and global sanctions,” O’Toole’s policy document states.

China, and Canada’s policies toward the country, have become a hot topic in the Conservative leadership race. Peter MacKay, Leslyn Lewis and Derek Sloan have all put out policies or statements.

None believe the current Trudeau policy is serving the country well and want to see a change.

MacKay, like the others, has called for Huawei to be banned from Canada’s 5G network.

“If Huawei was to build our 5G network, they would build a back door that the Chinese government could open at any time to invade the privacy of Canadian individuals and businesses,” MacKay says on his website.

“We need to fundamentally recalibrate our relations with China,” Lewis states in her policy. She also calls for putting Canada’s interests first.

As for Sloan, he says he would crack down on pressure tactics and spying by agents of China’s communist party here in Canada.

Bottom line, with any of the Conservative Party leadership hopefuls in charge, Canada will see a major reset in relations with China. After the incidents of the past few years, the country is ready for that change.

It goes beyond the kidnapping of Kovrig and Spavor. China has engaged in economic warfare with Canada, targeting our soy, canola, pork and beef producers, among others. They have long used agents here to spy on Canadian companies in order to steal trade secrets.

American news giant Bloomberg recently published a long story about the role China’s economic espionage played in the downfall of Nortel.

These are all serious problems that need to be addressed and the current government is failing us.

O’Toole’s policy paper on China shows that he understands these issues and more. He even calls for dealing with Chinese funding of schools in Canada, an issue that has flown under the radar of most.

So far, O’Toole has the most detailed and well-thought-out plan for dealing with these pressing issues.

In a statement, Quebec said residents must now complete online registration forms to be able to travel through Atlantic Canada to reach the Quebec islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

Quebec said the request came at the behest of New Brunswick and P.E.I. and that the registration procedures apply to all travellers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The two provinces have made this request to apply the same requirements or formalities to everyone wishing to travel in their territories,” the statement said.

Some Quebec politicians were angered last month when New Brunswick said Quebecers could not stay overnight on their way to the Iles-de-la-Madeleine.

Quebecers travelling to the islands by car need to go through New Brunswick to catch a ferry from Souris, P.E.I., a drive of at least 500 kilometres from the Quebec border.

“Considering the pandemic, the Quebec government and the two provinces concerned agreed on access to the ferry to the Iles-de-la-Madeleine and the requisite safe health-related measures,” the statement read.

Quebec also said residents must continue to meet other requirements to travel over land to the Iles-de-la-Madeleine during the pandemic.

Quebecers must fill out and carry a Quebec self-declaration card outlining their trip, the government said, as well as other documents, including a return ferry ticket, proof of address in the Iles-de-la-Madeleine, or a tourist accommodation reservation.

New Brunswick, P.E.I., Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador launched an Atlantic bubble on July 3, allowing residents to travel in the region without needing to self-isolate.

But travel restrictions remain in place for most people from outside the Atlantic provinces to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19.

Quebec has been Canada’s COVID-19 epicentre, recording more than half of all cases and deaths in the country to date.

The province has gradually reopened as the number of daily cases and deaths decreased, however.

“Migraine sufferers walk a tight line when it comes to managing their symptoms, and COVID-19 has been an impetus in derailing many otherwise well-controlled patients,” says Dr. Ian Finkelstein, medical director of the Toronto Headache and Pain Clinic.

Increased physical and mental stressors, increased anxiety, and changes in daily routine, including working from home, have triggered worsening symptoms for many people, says Finkelstein.

Plus, limited access to their headache specialists has made it tough for patients to manage their condition.

Migraines are one of the most severe and debilitating types of headaches, and impact close to three million Canadians, 80% of them women. Symptoms include throbbing head pain, nausea, vomiting and hypersensitivity to light and sounds.

Patients with chronic migraine — 15 or more days of severe headaches in a month — are more likely to have depression, anxiety, and chronic pain conditions.

The World Health Organization ranks migraines as one of the top 20 most disabling diseases and notes that “a day lived with a severe migraine can be more disabling than blindness, paraplegia or angina.”

Finkelstein urges those suffering from a worsening of their migraines to document their episodes in a ‘headache diary’ using the app Canadian Migraine Tracker at migrainetracker.ca.

People should record the frequency and severity of headaches, triggers and the types of medication they are using, and share that information with a doctor or headache specialist.

Finkelstein also recommends taking up relaxation exercises or meditation and engaging in some type of physical exercise.

Migraine sufferers also need to make a concentrated effort to stick to a regular schedule when it comes to diet, hydration and sleep.

If headaches are impacting your quality of life, and/or your reliance on medication use is increasing, find a headache specialist using your postal code via mychronicmigraine.ca. The tool also offers information, self-assessment, triggers and treatment options.

Finkelstein adds that use of headache relieving medications should be limited to less than 10 days per month to avoid rebound headaches.

In addition, Health Canada-approved preventative migraine treatment options — such as Botox or CGRP antibodies — can be effective. Speak to a medical professional about these options.",[],361,0.9879689832535024

The Republican president, seeking re-election in November, has been increasingly critical of government health officials and their guidance as a steady rise in infections threatens the easing of shutdown restrictions across the country.

Trump retweeted to his 83 million followers the accusations of a former game show host that “everyone is lying,” including the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

“The most outrageous lies are the ones about Covid 19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, Media, Democrats, our Doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust,” Chuck Woolery wrote Sunday night without citing evidence.

Well I guess I really stirred the pot yesterday. Why? I don't believe Fauci, the CDC and most of the so called experts on Covid 19 including the Media. What do you think? — Chuck Woolery (@chuckwoolery) July 13, 2020

Last week, Trump said he thought CDC guidelines for schools reopening were too tough, impractical and expensive.

On Monday, Trump also retweeted an April post from Woolery’s podcast co-host that Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, wants to require “an ID card to go shopping.” As the spread of the coronavirus accelerated months ago, Fauci said it was possible the United States could in the future issue a certification of immunity.

The White House did not respond to questions on whether the president believed the CDC was lying.

Trump told reporters later at the White House: “I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci.”

“I find him to be a very nice person. I don’t always agree with him,” Trump said.

Fauci on Monday ascribed the surge in coronavirus cases to the country’s failure to shut down completely, then a rush to reopen too soon, and urged a commitment to guidelines to rub out the disease.

“All you needed to do was look at the films on TV of people in some states who went from shutdown to complete throwing caution to the wind – bars that were crowded, people without masks,” Fauci said during a Stanford University event.

Fauci said he was confident the United States would get a handle on the virus “if we step back. You don’t necessarily need to shut down again, but pull back a bit, and then proceed in a very prudent way of observing the guidelines, of going from step to step.”

TENSIONS FLARE

Tensions with Fauci have risen with the decline of Trump’s popularity in the polls over the president’s handling of the outbreak. Fauci said in a Financial Times interview last week he had not briefed Trump in two months.

Fauci’s emphasis on protections including physical distancing, wearing masks, avoiding crowds and washing hands have put him at odds with a president eager to get people back to work to boost the economy.

The White House over the weekend distributed a list of statements Fauci made early in the pandemic that turned out to be wrong as understanding of the disease developed, according to media reports. But the White House said that it only sent responses to dozens of questions it had received from the Washington Post.

Health officials and the CDC have pleaded with the public to wear masks to limit the spread of the virus, but the issue has become a politically divisive issue in the United States unlike in many other countries which have seen far lower rates of infection and death.

Trump wore a mask for the first time in public when he visited a Washington D.C.-area military medical center on Saturday. He had previously refused to wear a mask in public or ask Americans to wear face coverings, saying it was a personal choice.",[],642,0.8171888450623847

The Reuters global tally, which is based on government reports, shows the disease is accelerating the fastest in Latin America. The Americas account for more than half the world’s infections and half the deaths.

Parts of the world, especially the United States with more than 3.3 million confirmed cases, are seeing huge increases in a first wave of COVID-19 infections while others “flatten the curve” and ease lockdowns.

Other places, such as the Australian city of Melbourne and Leicester in England, are implementing a second round of shutdowns. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, albeit with a low 1,522 cases, is to tighten social distancing measures again amid growing worries about a third wave.

The United States reported a daily global record of 69,070 new infections on July 10. In Brazil, 1.86 million people have tested positive, including President Jair Bolsonaro, and more than 72,000 people have died.

The U.S. state of Florida reported a record increase of more than 15,000 new cases in 24 hours on Sunday, more than South Korea’s total since the disease was first identified at the end of last year.

Coronavirus infections were rising in about 40 U.S. states, according to a Reuters analysis of cases for the past two weeks compared with the prior two weeks.

Yet U.S. President Donald Trump and White House officials have repeatedly said the disease is under control and that schools must reopen in the autumn.

“The president and his administration are messing with the health of our children,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program.

“We all want our children to go back to school, parents do and children do. But they must go back safely.”

STAY AT HOME

Hungary has imposed new restrictions on cross-border travel as of next Wednesday in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus after a surge in new cases in several countries, Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s chief of staff said on Sunday.

The leader of the Spanish region of Catalonia called on residents of an area that has seen a surge in coronavirus cases to stay at home despite a ruling by a judge who threw out a mandatory lockdown order for the district of 160,000 people.

Spain, which has been one of the European countries worst hit by the coronavirus, lifted nationwide confinement last month, when the pandemic seemed to have come under control.

The first case was reported in China in early January and it took three months to reach one million cases. It has taken just five days to climb to 13 million cases from 12 million recorded on July 8.

The number of cases is around triple that of severe influenza illnesses recorded annually, according to the World Health Organization.

There have been more than 568,500 deaths linked to the coronavirus so far, within the same range as the number of yearly influenza deaths reported worldwide. The first death was reported on Jan. 10 in Wuhan, China, before infections and fatalities surged in Asia, Europe and later in the United States.

India, the country with the third-highest number of infections, has been contending with an average of 23,000 new infections each day since the beginning of July.

In countries with limited testing capacity, case numbers reflect only a proportion of total infections. Experts say official data likely under-represents both infections and deaths.",[],575,0.7573256466471564

The new cases in New South Wales come after neighbouring Victoria state last week forced about 5 million people back into lockdown after a surge of new coronavirus cases.

Australia has avoided the high COVID-19 casualty numbers of other nations with swift and strict measures, recording fewer than 10,000 coronavirus cases in total, or about a sixth of the daily cases seen in the United States in recent days.

However, authorities are worried about rising cases of community transmission.

This accounted for 8 of the 14 new cases in New South Wales in the last 24 hours, while the rest were people who have returned from overseas and are already in hotel quarantine or have returned from Victoria.

The bulk of these community transmission cases were people who recently visited a pub in southwest Sydney, the Crossroads Hotel, taking the cluster to 13 in all.

“The concern is that this hotel is used by freight drivers who are transporting essential supplies across the country,” Australia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.

“They are not being tested.”

In a bid to curtail the spread, authorities urged anyone who attended the pub to isolate for two weeks and get tested.

On Monday, long lines of cars were waiting more than three hours to attend a drive-through test clinic at the venue.

The virus, however, has already spread to at least one more high traffic venue, with a patron at Sydney’s Star casino on July 4 testing positive for COVID-19, the Star Entertainment Group Ltd said.

In Victoria state, authorities on Monday reported 177 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, the eighth consecutive day of triple digit rises in COVID-19 cases, but down from 273 cases the previous day.

“It may not be our peak yet,” Victoria’s Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton told reporters in Melbourne. “I would like to see a week of decreasing numbers.”

Australia’s Minister for Health Greg Hunt said 1,000 military personnel had been dispatched to help state officials curtail the spread of the coronavirus.

Scientists, meanwhile, have begun trials of a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed at the University of Queensland.

Volunteers were due to receive the first vaccine dose on Monday morning. Preliminary results of the trial are expected to be released by the end of September, the university said.",[],412,0.8585812961300258

Hamilton Police say the deadly shooting happened in the southbound lanes of Red Hill Valley Pkwy., near King St., around 10 p.m.

The dead man has been identified as 27-year-old Matar Abouchere.

“Hamilton Police are investigating a double shooting on the Southbound Red Hill Valley Parkway in (Hamilton) between King and Greenhill,” police said on Twitter on Friday night.

“One male is deceased and the other is in hospital with serious injuries. Roads are closed in both directions as police investigate.”

The motive for the shooting is unclear and it was not immediately known if it was connected in any way to Pat Musitano’s killing.

Musitano, who narrowly survived a shooting just over a year ago, was fatally shot in the parking lot of a plaza on Plains Rd. E. around 1 p.m.

Two other men, one of whom was reportedly Musitano’s longtime bodyguard, were also wounded in the Burlington shooting.

Mallory, 72, a former TV station owner, had an insatiable appetite for vile child pornography.

At his 2013 sentencing, the judge described him as “probably the most prolific collector of child pornography in the entire world.”

In December 2012, he was found guilty of a staggering 60 counts of sexual exploitation of children, tampering with evidence and invasion of privacy.

Detectives found 26,000 files on his computers containing child pornography. The wealthy collector had an infinite number of images and videos showing “children being raped, tortured and sexually exploited.”

Game. Set. Match. Right? Wrong.

On May 27, he was paroled after the parole board decided the twisted man deserved to be released because, you know, “performance incentive credits.”

The prosecutor said he was “powerless” to stop it.

Mallory brought to mind Canada’s very own Blair Evans.

Now 70 years old, the one-time scientist at the Department of National Defence in Ottawa has been in and out of jail on child pornography charges since he was first arrested in 1996.

Every day, he dutifully clocked in at DND, then proceeded to spend every minute of his working day seeking out and downloading nauseating child pornography. Tens of thousands of images.

At the time, he was a married father of two living a quiet suburban existence. But beneath his nebbishy exterior was a dark heart consumed by demons.

“I remember standing on his doorstep, telling his wife what was going on. She was like, ‘No, he would never do something like that,’” said former Ottawa Police sex crimes investigator Keith Daniels. “Of course, he did.”

Evans was found guilty, served eight months in jail, and resumed his near religious devotion to his hobby.

In 2002, he was pinched again, this time in Toronto, for stashing a heartbreaking 200,000 images on his computer while he was on probation.

“These 200,000 images of children … represents tens of thousands of individual children as young as six months old being abused in the most horrendous ways,” Toronto Police Staff-Insp. Gary Ellis told The Toronto Sun at the time.

He was found guilty again, then in 2004 he was spotted accessing child pornography at the library and an internet cafe. Cops called the images “horrific.”

Again, he pleaded guilty. Total custody this time was just under four years. In 2009, he was dinged for breaching his probation.

Evans is now in the wind.

According to Sun files he hasn’t been in trouble since, but we are not privy to every single crime committed in this country. He may have gone straight, but I doubt it.

Suckers at the National Parole Board likely fell for whatever nonsensical tale Evans served up.

Rehabilitation was something the Georgia District Attorney Herb Cranford wasn’t buying.

“In the current digital age, no amount of supervision can stop a compulsive sexual deviant like Mallory from seeking out the most heinous images and videos of small children being sexually abused,” Cranford wrote in a desperate last ditch effort to keep the pedophile behind bars.

No such luck.

DOUBLE MURDER AT SKI LODGE

For 42 years, detectives have hit nothing but brick walls in a double murder at a New York state ski lodge that saw the killers get away with $18,000 from a hidden safe.

The cold-blooded murders of Wing Hollow Ski Corporation employees Michael R. Forness, 29, and Stephen C. Bender, 30, occurred on Feb. 6, 1978. It has remained unsolved.

Cops say that for the victims, they were in the wrong place at the wrong time on the icy cold morning in Allegheny, NY. Both were ski hill groomers working the overnight shift at the resort outside Olean.

Sometime between midnight and 1 a.m. the two men took a break and went to the chalet to get warm and do some chores. They walked into a burglary where the thugs were roving the cash-laden safe from a floor in the manager’s office.

Forness and Bender were each shot three times with the finishing touch a bullet to the back of their heads. A janitor found the bodies at 3 a.m.

Over the years, investigators have said the murders and heist were committed by “professionals” with the killers knowing about the hidden safe.

MISSING

Kenneth James Schmit

He was last seen at 10:30 p.m. leaving a local residence when he went to see about a new car and go fishing with pal Horace Green. Cops say the two men went to the home of a Mr. Romphf where an argument ensued about the car and Schmit — in good health and enjoying a happy home life — vanished forever.

Despite a massive search, he has never been found.

Still, it just took the grim reaper 23 years to collect the rotund gangster’s staggering karmic debt.

For the hitmen hunting the Hamilton mob boss, the third time turned out to be the charm.

In April 2019, Musitano narrowly missed getting toe-tagged when he was shot four times outside his Mississauga lawyer’s office.

On Friday, he didn’t budge from the broiling parking lot where he was cut down just after 1 p.m.

Musitano, 52, was taken off the board in a daring daytime hit at a Burlington plaza, likely bringing an end to three years of bloody gangland tit-for-tat that has left at least a dozen people dead.

According to The Hamilton Spectator, Musitano’s longtime bodyguard, John Clary, was also wounded in the shooting along with a third unidentified man.

The gangster’s violent death marked the end of more than 70 years of criminal activity in southern Ontario for the Musitano family.

Longtime mob observer James Dubro told The Toronto Sun the power vacuum left by the the mob scion’s death is small and there will likely be no recriminations.

It isn’t known whether a double shooting hours later that left one man dead on Hamilton’s Red Hill Pkwy. is connected to the Musitano hit. No matter.

“The Musitanos are finished. Period. It’s the end of that vendetta,” Dubro said, adding that Pat’s old crew would have trouble gathering enough guys for a hand of briscola.

He suspects the contract to ice Musitano was likely taken out by the Luppino or Violi families or young Turks from the newer N’drangheta cells that have emerged over the last decade.

Dubro has been predicting the violent demise of Pat Musitano for three years. He turned out to be correct.

The man known as “Fat Pat” was born into underworld royalty.

The crime family was founded in the early 1940s by Anthony Musitano, who fled to Canada after murdering his sister in an honour killing when she became pregnant out of wedlock.

In southern Ontario, the fugitive began building his extortion and gambling rackets to become a criminal powerhouse.

In 1965, his nephew, Dominic Musitano — Fat Pat’s father — took over and shared the spoils fairly peaceably with the Papalia and Luppino families. Oh, there were periodic business disputes that ended in the morgue, but the era was largely peaceful and profitable.

Pat Musitano and his younger brother Angelo “Ang” Musitano, followed their father and uncles into the underworld. Cops have estimated that by 1992 the crime family was earning $14 million a year, mostly through illegal gambling.

When Dominic Musitano left this mortal coil from a heart attack on Aug. 13, 1995, his eldest son took over. The brothers owed Johnny Papalia $250,000 and they had no intention of paying it.

In quick succession, The Enforcer was rubbed out on Railway St. in the city’s north end and just weeks later, his top lieutenant, Carmen Barillaro was clipped at his Niagara Falls home.

Triggerman Kenneth Murdock pointed the finger at the Musitano brothers as the architects of death. Murdock chirped that the brothers were sick of kicking back tribute to Buffalo (Papalia) and feared a deathly tabling of accounts from Barillaro.

Pat and Angelo Musitano were convicted of conspiracy to commit murder for the Barillaro hit. The Papalia charges were withdrawn.

But the Sicilian saying “revenge is a dish best served cold” hovered over the brothers and “Ang” checked out on May 2, 2017, when he was shot dead in his truck in the driveway of his Waterdown home.

Sources said he had recently found God.

At least 10 more underworld-connected figures would die by the gun over the next three years.

Dubro said with the implosion of his allies, the Rizzuto crime family in the Montreal, Pat Musitano’s doomsday clock went into overdrive.

The mobster was considered by other underworld figures as too brash, too impetuous, and graceless. And it caught up to him.

“Pat deserved his fate more than any psychotic killing gangster since (New York mob chief) Carmine “The Cigar” Galante,” Dubro said.

“Pat threatened me through my colleague Gord Martineau in 1991 when he came up in his Caddy with his boys as Gord and I were filming for a CITY special mob series near his auto body shop in downtown Hamilton. He told Martineau that I ‘belonged in Hamilton Harbour.’”

Dubro added: “There was too much piss and vinegar and nastiness in Pat. He had to go.”

Cops say one male was seen fleeing the scene west on Plains Rd. E. in a grey, four-door sedan, similar to an Infiniti Q50, with a sunroof. No suspect description was immediately released.

Anyone with information regarding this double shooting, the whereabouts of the suspect vehicle, or who has dashcam that may help investigators, is urged to call police at 905-825-4777 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).

MAN ALLEGEDLY SCAMMED LOWE’S TO BUILD HOME … FROM JAIL

A master scammer allegedly tried to build his Lake Placid, Fla., home by ripping off hardware supplies store Lowe’s from his jail cell.

According to The Daily Beast, Jared Murray regularly had construction materials from Lowe’s sent to the construction site of his home. Couriers delivered the material by rented U-Haul trucks at odd hours with Murray reportedly telling contractors his uncle worked at the store and received a 50% discount.

And all the work was handled reportedly by someone identifying themself as the man’s aunt.

Contractors noted that things were shady because they had never met Murray in person, with relatives telling them the man was on the road for business. But according to the FBI, Murray was actually in prison, where he hatched a plan to defraud Lowe’s out of more than $1 million in inventory.

FBI documents obtained by the Daily Beast noted that Murray has been behind bars for the past 10 years, serving a 25-year sentence for an armed robbery allegedly organized by his mother.

The FBI alleges Murray — who hasn’t been charged yet — had used smuggled cellphones to steal identities of local contractors with open lines of credit at Lowe’s. Murray would then allegedly order supplies and charge them to the contractors’ accounts.

Murray’s unfinished three-bedroom home is up for sale for $185,000 US, The Daily Beast noted. If the fraud scheme had worked, the sale of his home would have been pure profit.

According to the FBI, the home and land are in the process of being seized by the federal government.

MAN BATTLES DEADLY SNAKE WHILE DRIVING A 27-year-old Australian man didn’t expect to battle for his life while driving his pickup truck down a highway one day. According to Queensland Police on Tuesday, the man identified as Jimmy was driving down the Dawson Highway on June 15 at 100 km/h when he noticed an unwanted passenger in the form of an Eastern Brown Snake, a highly venomous reptile that’s responsible for a majority of snakebites in the country. “The more I moved my legs … it just started to wrap around me. Its head just started striking at the (driver’s seat) chair, between my legs,” Jimmy said, according to a media release. Queensland cops say Jimmy used a knife and a seat belt to battle the slithery serpent as he tried to stop the car. During the tussle, Jimmy feared he had been bitten as Eastern Browns are known for their fast and fatal bites.

When bitten, the snake’s venom can cause paralysis and bleeding in the brain.

Jimmy eventually killed the snake and hightailed it to the nearest hospital. An officer pulled Jimmy over after seeing him drive 123 km/h down the highway.

The speeding man told the officer about the dead snake in the back of his truck and how he thought it had bitten him. That’s when the officer called for help.

Flying over the area in a helicopter, a Reuters reporter saw one carcass splattered in droppings from vultures, which had eaten some of the flesh, and red paint from officials marking verified carcasses. Hundreds of live elephants wandered nearby.

“We are not dealing with a common thing, it looks like it’s a rare cause,” said Mmadi Reuben, principal veterinary officer at the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, adding the death rate in the affected area was below 2%.

“We cannot rule out anything at this stage, it could be a virus, vegetation, overnutrition after last year’s drought … We have asked the community not to interact with the carcasses.”

He said officials were expecting to receive test results this week on samples sent to South Africa and Canada.

Some campaign groups have criticized the government for acting too slowly to solve the mystery of the dying elephants, an accusation Reuben has denied.

Although the number of deaths so far represents a fraction of the estimated 130,000 elephants in Botswana, there are fears more could die if authorities cannot establish the cause soon.

Wave Kashweka, a senior veterinary officer in Botswana’s North-West district, said officials had found elephants which appeared to have died recently, adding aerial surveys would try to find more carcasses.

In their initial inquiries, authorities ruled out poaching and anthrax among possible causes.

Cyril Taolo, acting director of the wildlife department, said the government had contacted neighbors Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Zambia but they had not seen similar elephant deaths.

Africa’s overall elephant population is declining due to poaching, but Botswana, home to almost a third of the continent’s elephants, has seen numbers grow from 80,000 in the late 1990s.",[],345,0.9810447671616602

And this time, he’s not just mopping down floors — he’s peddling masks.

Offer Shlomi, otherwise known as Vince Offer, the official spokesperson for the infomercial absorbent towel, said the same material is now being marketed as cloth masks to offer a level of protection during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“And disposable masks? You’re wasting money like you’re a billionaire in a nightclub!” he said in the commercial.

Offer claims the ShamWow masks are breathable, machine-washable and equipped with a cotton inner layer for comfort and made in the U.S. and Germany with the same material used to make surgical masks. In a Canadian version of the ad, it says the masks are “crafted” in Canada with a backdrop of the Canadian flag.

He claims that the ShamWow mask is infused “with real zinc to fight and stop bacteria and other microbes.”

Offer contends that other cloth masks are made with woven fibres that allow “viruses to get through easily.”

Infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch said Wednesday the claim that zinc will protect people from the coronavirus “is garbage.”

“We know that we should be putting on a mask when going into an indoor environment,” Bogoch said.

“The primary role of these masks is to prevent people who have this infection from transmitting it to other people. If you cover your nose and mouth, you reduce the risk of spreading this virus. Regardless is of what’s in the mask (they claim) will help reduce the spread of infection. On one hand, if this gets people to put on a mask, great. On the other hand, I don’t think people can come away thinking that certain masks have certain properties that will provide them with certain benefits.”

Offer, who also peddled a kitchen device called the Slap Chop, is no stranger to controversy.

In 1998, he filed a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox and Bobby and Peter Farrelly, the co-directors of There’s Something About Mary, claiming that 14 scenes in that movie were lifted from his film, The Underground Comedy Movie. The case was dismissed in 2000.

In 2004, Offer sent out a press release announcing his intentions to sue the Church of Scientology over what he claimed was a large-scale smear campaign against him and The Underground Comedy Movie.

On Feb. 7, 2009, Offer and a 26-year-old sex worker were arrested in Miami Beach, Fla. after he allegedly beat her up. Prosecutors later declined to file formal charges against either person.

The ShamWow masks also repeatedly state they are not manufactured in China.

“Those other masks you see on TV are made in China. I love Chinese people, too, but come on!” he said.

Each mask is priced at $29.99 US.

Towards the end of the minute-long TV spot, Offer holds up a potted plant.

“And you save the environment,” he says before throwing the plant behind him.

“Forget the environment, save yourself.”

A person commented on the video uploaded to YouTube: “When the world needed him most, he didn’t vanish. He returned.”

The Department of National Defence has put out a tender for goats and sheep to graze on part of the base at 4 Wing Cold Lake.

“We did this in (CFB) Comox a few years ago and I have a feeling the idea kind of kicked off from that experience,” said Captain Mat Strong, public affairs officer for 1 Canadian Air Division based in Winnipeg.

“The reason we’re using goats is because the areas that need to be trimmed are in precarious locations such … where drainage ditches exist.”

The tender, which has now closed, said the base has areas that are difficult to maintain due to the degree of slope and accessibility.

“To get people in there with trimmers and stuff takes days, because they do it by hand. But you can just dump a bunch of goats in there and they can take care of it in no time,” Strong said.

The contract calls for a herd of 250 animals: 70% goats and 30% sheep.

Strong said it’s not something planned for other bases across the country.

Using goats for weed control isn’t new. It’s been around in Europe for centuries and the critters have been employed in Kamloops, B.C., and Regina to deal with invasive weeds.

The City of Calgary started to use goats to wipe out noxious weeds — most notably the Canada thistle — in a more environmentally friendly way at an urban park in 2016.

“We’ve got three different goat herds operating in the city right now. I would say it has been a success,” said Chris Manderson, who handles urban conservation for Calgary Parks.

Manderson said the newest area to get a goat herd next week is a steep bluff north of the Bow River downtown.

“Goats are a lot better at negotiating that hillside than people would be. A conventional approach would be guys out there with backpack sprayers.”

Strong said removing vegetation is a good way to keep down unwanted wildlife at the base where bears, moose and deer have wandered onto the runway.

The new recruits will only be used as needed, he said.

“It’s kind of like a snow removal or lawn care service you’d have for your house,” Strong said.

“They basically use them for a defined period of time. And if they’re not needed again for a week or two, they go away and then they come back.”",[],411,0.9783195057298759

United,'Steve Bufferymore Steve Buffery',2020-07-13 17:42:22+00:00,"Walt Disney World likes to say that “magic happens” at their resorts.

That was on display on Monday morning as a depleted D.C. United side magically came back from a 2-0 deficit late to tie Toronto FC 2-2 at the MLS is Back tournament.

It’s stunning how TFC continues to “magically” — and brutally — give up late goals and blow what appears to be sure victories. TFC was in control for the vast majority of the match against D.C. United but – as Reds fans have witnessed far too often last season — the Toronto side broke down defensively, resulting in three points turning into one.

“I’m not sure I’d call that a tendency,” said TFC captain Michael Bradley, when asked about his club’s tendency” to give up late goals. “It’s a little bit too easy of a conclusion to come to. We’re angry without ourselves, we’re frustrated. For a team that wants to be as good as we do, and for a team that holds ourselves to the standards that we do, there’s no way you should let a team like that back into the game. But I’m not going to sit here and draw all sorts of crazy conclusions based on the first game back in a really long time under these circumstances.”

The draw ruined what had been a glorious performance by TFC youngster Ayo Akinola, who hadn’t played a game for TFC’s first team in over a year. The 20-year-old scored both of Toronto goals — the first match for both teams at the MLS is Back event, held at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida.

D.C. United was forced to play with only 10 men in the second half after Junior Moreno picked up a second yellow card late in the first resulting in the final 45 minutes being played at a crawl. The heat and humidity were also factors. However, a defensive breakdown by the Reds allowed D.C. United to get to within one goal when Federico Higuain scored in the 84th minute on a breakaway when he chipped a shot over Toronto keeper Quentin Westberg. Frederic Brillant scored in the 91st minute with a header to put the dagger in TFC’s heart. Akinola almost scored the winner via a looping header in the final few seconds of the game, but was robbed by D.C. United goalkeeper Bill Hamid with a fine left-handed save.

With TFC ahead 2-0, Vanney replaced his two starting centre backs — Chris Mavinga and Omar Gonzalez – in the 64th minute — with Laurent Ciman and Eriq Zavaleta — changes the coach said he was forced to make.

“At halftime (defender) Justin (Morrow) had some Achilles tendonitis issues, he’s pretty sore at half,” said the coach. “And then 10 minutes into the second half, Omar’s cramping up, he can’t take a step. And before their water break, Chris is cramping up. This is the first game in extreme temperatures. So the question then becomes how much do you really push guys in the first game of a tournament, the first game in months? And so we went with the changes and I thought that really disrupted our ability to start attacks and keep possession of the ball. And also we struggled in some of the transition defending. At that point, we started to lose a bit of the momentum and a bit of the possession. (And) we need to continue to try to attack and look for the third goal and not just pass the ball around.”

The match ended with some unpleasantness on the pitch as players pushed and shouted at each other.

“Part of it is just football. Part of is that you have on a hot, humid day, you have one team down 2-0, with one man less, and is able to come back and get a point. They’re obviously excited, we’re obviously disappointed. That’s normal,” said Bradley. “The other part is, over the last few days, from their side, we’ve got a real sense that they’re all pissed off and angry with the fact that we showed up late, almost feeling like we’re trying to cheat the system and get a leg up on everybody. That obviously couldn’t be further from the truth.

“We’re in the middle of a pandemic. We’re trying to look after ourselves and look after each other and, in turn, look out for any of the teams we play against,” Bradley added.

TFC and D.C. United were originally supposed to play on Friday, but that match was postponed because the Reds were late travelling to Orlando after a member of the team’s travel party came down with symptoms, though tests proved negative. The match was changed to Sunday, but that was also postponed when a D.C. United player tested positive and a TFC player had a test that was “inconclusive”. Both players, who have not been identified, later tested negative, and the match was moved to Monday morning. The Reds’ second group stage match against the Montreal Impact was subsequently moved to Thurs., July 16 at 8:00 p.m. and if the TFC player, whose first test in Orlando was inconclusive, tests negative a second time, he can play in that game.

The Reds were without veteran forward Jozy Altidore for Monday’s match. Altidore missed training time with his teammates in Toronto as he spent much of the down time during the COVID-19 pandemic at his home in Florida before joining TFC in late June. Upon returning to Toronto, he had to go into quarantine for two weeks and, as a result, wasn’t ready to play. Vanney was also without the services of rookie sensation Ifunanyachi Achara, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in training earlier this month and is out for the season – -prompting the coach to put Brampton native Akinola in the starting XI.

The tie gives TFC a win and two draws in three games of the interrupted Major League Soccer season. Prior to the suspension of the MLS regular season because of the pandemic, the Reds opened with a 2-2 draw in San Jose on Feb.29- another match that saw TFC blow a two-goal lead in the second half — and then defeated New York City FC 1-0 in the TFC home opener on March 7, the lone goal scored by Achara.

Akinola, who last played for the first team on June 29, 2019, opened the scoring in the 12th minute on Monday with a terrific right-foot shot into the left corner — the second of his young MLS career. He then scored in the 44th minute after some great work by Alejandro Pozuelo again, who found Akinola at the side of the goal and the young Toronto forward easily left-footed it home past Hamid. It was Akinola’s third career start with TFC. In added time in the first half, Westberg made a sensational right-handed save on Ola Kamara header to preserve the two-goal lead.

Bradley played the whole match, despite suffering an injury to his ankle in the MLS Cup final on November 10 in Seattle and underwent surgery in January. He missed the first two TFC games of the 2020 season before MLS ceased playing. Bradley didn’t appear to suffer from the layoff on Monday as he was a commanding presence in midfield — playing the full match despite the heat and humidity and length of time between games. New designated Player Pablo Piatti also missed the two opening games of the season after suffering a strained hamstring at pre-season at the University of California Irvine and was in the starting XI on Monday, playing 70 solid minutes in his Reds debut. Veteran midfielder Jonathan Osorio did not dress after suffering a quad injury a few weeks ago. Vanney is hoping he’ll be available in Toronto’s third game of the tournament.

But the Grammy winner is also using his platform to speak out on social issues, including the Black Lives Matter movement and the case of Breonna Taylor, an ER technician who was killed when police officers raided her apartment on a drug bust in Kentucky earlier this year.

On his Instagram page, Bieber has been posting calls for the police who were involved in the shooting to be arrested and late Sunday night, he shared a photo with Taylor’s name and captioned the image with a stirring call to action.

“WTF is going on?” he wrote. “I need updates. How are these police officers not arrested? She was innocently shot and killed in her own home by police. I’m not going to forget.”

While many fans supported his message, one follower going by the name Jeremy Slovacek took issue with Bieber’s plea, writing, “How about you worry about Canada and your mental issues. We got this down here in America! How about naming all the babies slaughtered at Planned Parenthood, the innocent black girl gunned down in Illinois this weekend, how about all those black in black shooting deaths in Chicago? When are we gonna talk about that? Hey Justin, you got money, start an organization instead of word salads.”

The comment caught Bieber’s eye, with the Intentions star replying, “(Are you) saying that because I’m Canadian I shouldn’t worry about my fellow man? There’s an issue and I’m speaking about it because not only is it my right but my honour to stand by my fellow man.”

Bieber continued, adding, “There are many issues I can speak on but right now, I’m speaking on Breonna Taylor, who was murdered in her own home.”

In a separate message, Bieber continued writing, “I will never stop fighting for my brothers and sisters. BLACK LIVES MATTER.”

Last month, in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests sparked by George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis in May, Bieber admitted his career had been influenced greatly by Black culture.

“I am inspired by Black culture. I have benefited off of Black culture,” he wrote. “My style, how I sing, dance, perform and my fashion have all been influenced and inspired by Black culture.”

In the message to his 141 million followers, Bieber continued: “I am committed to using my platform from this day forward to learn, to speak up about racial injustice and systemic oppression, and to identify ways to be part of a much-needed change.”

Since the coronavirus pandemic closed the border between Canada and the U.S., Bieber and his wife Hailey have been staying at their mansion on Puslinch Lake near Cambridge, Ont.

Bieber bought the 9,000-square-foot mansion in 2018 for $5 million.

While the COVID-19 pandemic has shuttered the game, we still yearn for the slap of the puck on the ice.

Hockey is in our lifeblood. It boosts our morale; it fuels our economy. The Stanley Cup is our holy grail.

That’s why we – cautiously – welcome the plan to create two NHL hubs in Edmonton and Toronto as the league gradually reopens.

This is a vote of confidence by the NHL in the way this country has dealt with the pandemic. It’s a payoff, if you will, for the long days of lockdown and a slow and careful reopening. No doubt the league would prefer the hubs to be in the U.S. as Las Vegas was the favoured venue.

Given the swath the virus has hacked through the southern U.S., Canada has become the preferred choice for the NHL to continue its truncated season, starting Aug. 1.

Of course, we can’t be complacent about the threat of virus flare-ups in those hubs, especially since there will be no mandatory 14-day self-isolation period for players and their retinues.

But, we trust the teams and officials to enforce the restrictions and stay in their bubbles. They’ll be confined to their hotel rooms, hotel restaurants and to team outings. There’s too much for them to lose if they ignore those limits. Quite apart from the setback another outbreak would cause in the host cities, it would be devastating for the teams. This virus is crippling to the body. Any athlete who’s infected risks losing his life and his career. There will be daily testing of the players and their entourages, plus referees and linesmen.

This country has so far managed fairly well through the pandemic, but we can’t stay shut down forever. Yes, there was a setback recently with MLS when a recent Toronto FC game was postponed over virus fears. But we can’t keep looking in the rearview mirror. For our economy to recover, to restore hope, we must start opening key businesses sensibly using social distancing measures.

Foodbenders, a Bloordale health food eatery, enraged the Jewish community by using its Instagram to praise terrorists, equate Zionists with Nazis, allege that a Canadian Jewish group “control(s) your media and elected officials,” and even announce “#zionistsnotwelcome.”

After an unprecedented mobilization of grassroots Jewish community activists, Foodbenders was dropped by food industry giants like Uber Eats, Ritual and DoorDash, then abandoned by many of its former clients, including Pusateri’s Fine Foods and Ambrosia Natural Foods.

In a particularly bizarre twist, one overzealous community member even spray-painted a Star of David onto the storefront, before it was swiftly erased. While vandalism and vigilantism are always unacceptable, the bottom line is that this was a story with legs, which indeed captivated Jewish news outlets throughout Canada, the United States, Europe and Israel. Even Quds News Network — an appendage of the Hamas terrorist group — got in on the act, but in order to defend the antisemitic Instagram posts, of course.

Meanwhile, crickets were heard from Canadian media. Aside from a series of intrepid reports by the Sun’s own Sue-Ann Levy, and a passing mention in a Toronto Star column, non-Jewish Canadians would have had no idea that any of this was occurring.

This abject silence is all the more jarring given that, during the same period, dozens of stories featuring all manner of racism and discrimination were covered by Canadian outlets. One prominent Toronto publication maintains a staff of journalists assigned to beats such as “Social Justice” and “Identity and Inequality” — but they said nothing, reported nothing as a Toronto eatery stirred up anti-Jewish hate online, then paid the predictable price.

Just as all this was happening, footage emerged of an anti-Israel rally last Saturday in Mississauga where participants chanted: “Palestine is our land, and the Jews are our dogs!” Anti-Semitism is nothing new on the Canadian pro-Palestinian scene, especially in Mississauga, but what made this disgrace unique was the fact that the rally organizers and many of the anti-Jewish chanters were mere high school students.

Again, aside from a fine column by the Sun’s Tarek Fatah and one report by Global News, Canadian media was quiet as a mouse, while Jews were dehumanized by a mob of teenagers, in broad daylight, at a public square in one of Canada’s most diverse and fastest-growing cities.

This self-imposed silence on anti-Semitism is especially unforgivable in light of the statistics. In 2019, according to the Toronto Police Service, Jews were the most targeted demographic for hate crimes, despite amounting to just 1.1% of the total population according to the 2016 Census.

The numbers out of Peel Region, which includes Mississauga, were even more hair-raising; Jews were the most targeted religious group in 2019, while constituting a miniscule 0.1% of the population as of the 2016 census.

These numbers accord with B’nai Brith’s own Annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents, which recorded 2,207 incidents in 2019 — a grim new record, amounting to six acts of anti-Jewish hate per day on average. As explained in our Eight-Point Plan to Tackle Antisemitism, there is work to be done on this score by all three levels of government: Federal, provincial and municipal.

But Canadian media have a part to play in this process as well. News sources in democratic societies have always acted in part out of a need to hold systems of authority to account, and to ensure that they do better.

Why, Canadian Jews are asking, do the same media outlets that help to pursue justice for Indigenous Canadians, Afro-Canadians, LGBTQ Canadians and others turn a blind eye to the issues affecting the community most affected by hate crimes in many of our cities?

How can we truly build a fairer and more equal society when anti-Semitism, the world’s oldest and most pervasive hatred, all too often goes unreported?

An owner of an Airbnb property should likely expect the occasional mess or minor damage, but not having a property transformed into a drug drop-off.

That was the case for at least two properties in Greenville County, S.C. when entrepreneurial criminal types booked the properties overnight through Airbnb and then had weed delivered to the waiting “guests”, according to the Greenville County Multi-Jurisdictional Drug Enforcement Unit (DEU).

But the police were on alert, having learned earlier about a weed shipment to a number of sites in the county. They staked out two rental properties and intercepted 22 pounds of cannabis from California that were contained in two separate parcels. Twelve pounds of weed was intercepted at one property and 10 pounds at the other, combining for a street value of an estimated US$90,000.

“The owners of the rental homes had no idea their residences were being used as a drug drop location,” said Bart McEntire, commander of Greenville County Multi-Jurisdictional Drug Enforcement Unit, according to WMBF News. “It is not an uncommon tactic of the drug world to take advantage of unsuspecting home owners to conceal their illicit activity,” McEntire noted.

Police believe the two people receiving the cannabis had accepted prior weed shipments.

Kelby Joshua Darnell McKinney, 26, and Ana Lashae LeGrand, 25, were arrested, WMBF News reports.

Greenville is a popular spot for importing cannabis, McEntire told the TV station, explaining that pipelines of illegal distribution have opened up in line with decriminalization of weed in western portions of the U.S.

And California seems to be a popular source of the cannabis. “Marijuana shipments from California to Greenville have exploded,” Greenville County Sheriff Hobart Lewis suggested to WMBF News.

Of particular concern are THC-infused products that look like candy, Lewis reportedly said, citing a recent shipment of gummy bears that bore the name of a well-recognized gummy brand.

You dutifully wear it the to the grocery story, the coffee shop, indeed whenever you’re in a public building — that’s now the law in Ottawa.

But what do you do with it at the end of the day?

Ottawa Public Health lists the dos and don’ts of mask wearing on its website, including instructions on how to clean and reuse your cloth mask.

First of all, the mask offers little protection — it can even increase your risk of infection — if you’re constantly fiddling with it or adjusting the fit. So rule No. 1 is, “Hands off.”

When it does come time to remove your mask, wash your hands with soap and water or hand sanitizer, then pull the loops away from your ears. If it has a removable, non-reusable filter, pull that out and dispose of it in the garbage before washing your mask.

The mask can be tossed in with your regular laundry, using the hot water cycle.

If it’s not going into the laundry straight away, place it in a disposable bag that you can throw out later.

After handling your mask, be sure to wash your hands again.

You can hand wash your mask, too. Use laundry soap and the hottest water you can stand, then be sure to dry it thoroughly.

You can reuse your cloth mask throughout the day so long as it doesn’t get damaged or soiled. Ottawa Public Health says to fold the mask in half, with the outer surface facing inward, and store it in clean, sealable bag until it’s needed again.

A disposable mask can’t be cleaned or reused and should be thrown out safely, which doesn’t mean tossing it on the ground or leaving it in a shopping cart.

None of them ever had to guide their teams through this kind of season, halted for four months by a global pandemic, restarted with a daring mid-summer 24-team tournament with COVID-19 still not eliminated and last week’s new CBA changing the big picture.

On the eve of Monday’s opening of Maple Leafs training camp for Return To Play, the 34-year-old Dubas discussed with Toronto media the challenges facing himself and his club. Here’s a Q&A from the conference call.

Q: What pressure does the flat cap in the CBA put on you to win this tournament while you can keep this roster together?

A: “I don’t look at the situation and say this is our only chance. If we didn’t have our core guys locked up for this year and next, I would maybe feel a little bit differently. We have the 2019-20 contracts to finish and the ‘20-21s.

“I know that seems to be the narrative about the team. But I don’t feel that this season there should be any added pressure. I think the players have an expectation and we have an expectation that we’re going to be competitive and of course try to contend to win the Stanley Cup.

“If we were facing a decision of our core players, we’d have to make a major move. We’re going to have some space to take care of our RFAs and potentially look at some of our own UFAs. We have time.

“(But) with the cap flat, our development system will be paramount.”

Q: When did the last players arrive in Toronto, do you anticipate any Leafs will opt out of RTP by Monday’s 5 p.m. deadline and what do you think of players who have already done so?

“I don’t think it looks right now that any of the players we have invited will be opting out, I don’t have any inkling of that. The players have mostly all been here for quite a while now, at least a week off the top of my head.

“I think (opting out) was a great thing for the League and the PA to do. If any of our players were to opt out for any reason, we’d be fully understanding. This is such a difficult time in the world and whether it’s for reasons of underlying health or just general family reasons or whether you’re just not comfortable. I certainly respect any of our players who would feel that way and any player in the league or staff member that would feel that way.”

Q: What might your final roster look like in terms of numbers?

A: “We want to make sure that every roster player has a role. We didn’t want to have two or three extra guys at the bottom that didn’t really feel that they were close to playing. So maybe up to 28 or 29 players (15 to 16 forwards, nine to 10 defencemen, three goaltenders).

“What I would say to all those players (competing on the fringe) is they’ve got the chance to make an impact. That’s one of the great things about this next two weeks. We’re going to have some time to evaluate everybody. If Nick (Robertson), Kenny Agostino or Adam Brooks step up and are beating down the door throughout training camp, we’re going to give them opportunity.”

“(Forward) Nic Petan was deemed fit to play by our medical staff (Sunday). He had been a full participant in Phase 2, so he will be added to the roster and (Marlies defenceman) Mac Hollowell will be removed.”

Q: What will determine if Robertson makes the team?

A: “The way that he performs in practises and scrimmages. We’re going to give him every shot. We’re not going to look at his age (18). If he can make an impact playing with older, stronger players, we’ll roll from there.

“The latter half of this week we’ll start to replicate game experiences. It’s not a normal camp with 70 guys. There’s no ability (for Robertson) to get lost.

“We have to make cuts as we go along to be bubble compliant.”

Q: Are there any advantages to being at Scotiabank Arena with 11 other teams?

A: “There is a bit of familiarity. But there’s not going to be any fans, no game operations. I think there’s also a challenge of the fact that your family is 10 minutes away and on July 26 when we move in (the hotel), we’re all going to be sealed in away from them.

“We know the rink, but we’re going to be abiding by such strict protocols and entry and exit and we’re not getting any preferred treatment in terms of hotel or facilities. I think the League has done a pretty good job of keeping that very fair. The only advantage is we don’t have a flight to get here.”

Q: What will the calibre of hockey be like in RTP?

A: “I have no idea. We’re going to find out soon, though. There’s no experience that anyone has had – you could maybe look at some of the World Cups and Canada Cups that have come off long layoffs – but even then, those are August tournaments coming off a May, June, April finish, depending on where you were in the standings.

This is an August resumption after a March ending, so almost a five-month layoff with really one exhibition game.”

Q: Who else will be living in the bubble besides you and (team president) Brendan Shanahan?

A: “We’ll have the six-person coaching staff (Sheldon Keefe, assistants Paul McFarland and Dave Hakstol, goalie coach Steve Briere and video coaches Andrew Brewer and Jordan Bean). And then every other staff member are people we’d deem that directly benefit the player’s performance (medical, trainers, etc.).”

Q: What do you think of the RTP format?

A: “The NHL has done a great job of adapting to find a way to certainly recognize that playoff races weren’t over and to have teams that were in the race kept alive.

“Despite the fact if the season had just ended on March 10 we would have in the playoffs and scheduled to play Tampa, I don’t think that it’s unfair that we have to play a qualifying round whatsoever because we were still supposed to have 12 games left to try to either make up some ground or secure our space.

“I think it’s very fairly set up even though we’re one of those teams that’s gone from playoffs into a qualifying round like a number of others that are seeded five through eight.

“None of us have ever been in a series where seven of the teams are staying in the same hotel. It’s like minor hockey where if the game in front of you runs a little bit long, you’re kind of waiting for that game to end in overtime or what have you.”

Q: What will this be like for Keefe?

A: “When we made the coaching change (Mike Babcock being fired in late November) Sheldon had one morning skate to get the team up and running for a game that night. Now he’s had essentially a full build up with the coaching staff. And we’ll have a two-week camp to get the players up and rolling, so I think there’s some good fortune for us on that end as well.

“We’re excited to see that, not only for the short run, but I think it’s a great experience for Sheldon and will help us and help him. And we’re largely past some of the injuries that had plagued us at the end of the season. We’re certainly excited to see (a fully healthy blueline).”

Q: What’s Auston Matthews’ status? (the Leafs’ leading scorer contracted Covid during the spring at his summer residence in Scottsdale, Ariz.)

A: “He’s fit to play”

Q: The team goes against Columbus without a lot of recent playoff success.

A: “I’m optimistic. This is our fourth series. We do have experience; guys know ebbs and flows now. Guys on the team that have been in the American League and with the Marlies have played in a lot of series and most of them have played in best of five as well. I think all of that is great to handle and to certainly go back on for experience as we kind of work our way through it.

“With regards to our chances, I think like every team now, we’re largely past some of the injuries that had plagued us at the end of the season and those players are due back (Jake Muzzin, Ilya Mikheyev).

“(The Blue Jackets) have a very specific organizational culture and ethos about them. They’re extremely hard-working. They’re a group that handles resiliency extremely well. They’re obviously a very tight-knit group”.

Q: You want to move on from talk you could win the draft lottery, but that could happen if you lose in the first round.

A: “That’s not where we’re thinking. If you don’t win that lottery, then it’s still a disappointing season. It’s so far away from where our franchise is at and what we’re trying to do.

“You lose, you get a 12.5% chance of winning the first pick and all of those eight teams get the same chance. To me the probability of losing and then winning the pick is still so low that we don’t really look at it that way.

“Our whole focus is on doing everything we can to try to win 19 games.”

Q: You’ve come through some injuries as mentioned. And what’s the outlook for Andreas Johnsson’s knee injury?

A: “I don’t look at the injuries necessarily as a negative thing because they allowed us to see (defencemen) Rasmus Sandin, Timothy Liljegren and Justin Holl in a role that we thought he might be capable of. He grabbed the wheel with both hands and showed he’s able and certainly capable of playing big minutes in the NHL.

“(Injuries) allowed us to learn about our prospects on defence that will help us as we go into this stage in terms of depth and certainly in the future. I think that the injuries that we had throughout the year were more of a blessing. They forced us to put guys in a higher spot in the lineup like Travis Dermott when Muzzin went out of the lineup.

“Andreas was a six-month timeline. He would be somebody that we could expect to see, if all goes well with the end of his rehab, perhaps beginning at the second round of the actual playoffs to be safe. He’s done well with his rehab, in Gothenburg (Sweden).”

Q: How has the team handled Phase 2, the smaller group practices, and all the restrictions as you enter Phase 3?

A: “I’ve been extremely impressed by the way that all of our players have handled this, which is a voluntary phase; how hard they’ve worked, what they’ve requested from our staff to help them with and their commitment throughout. I know in the long term that will pay off and we’re certainly hopeful that, in the short term here as we get back, that has a great impact on where we’re going as a program.”

Q: Is the team ready for the isolation, the bubble environment and all that goes into the lengthy RTP protocols?

A: “It’s easier for us to see the finish line from Toronto, because of the job (three levels of government) have done to handle the virus. I don’t know what it would feel like to be in a spot where the virus is running rampant.”

Life in quarantine isn’t exactly ideal, regardless of one’s occupation or the size of one’s paycheque.

Feds paved the way for the Blue Jays to set up shop at Rogers Centre for the club’s summer camp, putting in place strict guidelines for players and coaches to follow.

It’s all in anticipation of the team’s 60-game sprint of a season, which is scheduled to begin July 24 in St. Petersburg, Fla., against the Tampa Bay Rays.

In essence, Shaw aired his frustration in a public forum, knowing there’s a chance the Jays may be back in Toronto to play the home portion of their season.

Naturally, his words became a story.

He set the record straight Sunday and from this day moving forward the Shaw Twitter storm is no longer worth discussing, at least it shouldn’t be unless another player goes public.

“It came out a little bit differently than what I probably should have said it,” began Shaw when the inevitable question was raised. “I should have worded it a little bit differently. I was a little bit tone deaf given the situation everybody is in right now. My first tweet, honestly, was relaying information (retweeting a journalist’s report on what the penalties for breaking quarantine could be). When we came up here (Toronto) we thought it would be for two weeks. We weren’t aware it could possibly be the entire summer.

“And the second tweet (“All summer isn’t gonna happen. Not an option”) was out of frustration when I read into it a little bit more. I definitely should have left that one out. Like I said earlier, I was a little tone deaf to the situation. And I apologize for that. At no point was I saying I’m going to break the rules, we’re going to break the rules. We know as a team that that’s not an option. To get through the season everybody is going to have to buy in and everybody is going to have to adhere to the protocols that were set. Honestly, if other teams don’t follow similar protocols, and I know the rules aren’t going to be as strict in the United States as they are up here.

“If other teams don’t follow strict guidelines and police themselves, we’re not going to get through a season anyway. I know everyone is on board with that in the locker room. Me, personally, I was frustrated. I have a place literally a block away from Rogers Centre, which I was hoping to live in this year. It doesn’t look like that’s going to be the case. The rules have kind of changed a little bit from when we first got up here.

“It was kind of the first time I had heard about it that we’d be here all summer. It’s not ideal to live in a hotel for three months. I don’t think anyone would want to be stuck in a hotel room for three months. I personally like to go on walks, get away from work. Nice days like today (Sunday) in Toronto just to walk by the water, but we can’t do that this year. The Canadian government has made that pretty strict and we’re going to have to follow that. I personally will follow that. I know there are strict penalties (a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ball park, which are maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act). Once again I was a little bit tone deaf to the situation … I apologize for that. I take full responsibility and I do not want this to become a distraction, don’t want this to become a story.”

Shaw wanted to quash it and move on, which his Sunday words clearly allows him to do.

In the absence of real games and this COVID cloud hovering over baseball with many inside the game fearing the season won’t have a conclusion, non-baseball items become fodder.

The focus isn’t how Shaw can concentrate on playing third base, now that the decision to switch Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to first base has been made.

It’s not about the rotation or bullpen.

Instead, one is left with issues ranging from where the Jays will play their home games, when a player may decide to opt out, when a positive test gets reported.

Shaw added how sit-down meetings involving players and management were held Saturday to clear the air.

“I definitely feel I’m more informed now than, say, a week ago,’’ he said. “I kind of know what the deal is going forward. I know that they (Blue Jays) are still working with the government to get clearance for the regular season, but coming up here I don’t think anyone thought that we could possibly be here for three months. Everything is kind of happening on the fly right now and we’re going to have to adjust accordingly … Public health, public safety is priority No. 1, team health, team safety is priority No. 2. We have to keep everyone in that locker room safe. You can’t be selfish. I’m definitely more informed now than I was couple days ago.”

The Jays find themselves in a bind, because there aren’t many viable options staring at them.

“I don’t think anyone wants to play in Dunedin (the team’s spring training home). That could be a competitive disadvantage just because of the heat, the weather and the COVID outbreak that’s going on in Florida right now. Options are pretty limited right now. Personally, I like playing in the Rogers Centre. I always have my whole career. It’s looking like as long as we get clearance we can play here. And we’ll just go from there.”

Being in a three-month-long bubble, assuming the Jays play their home games in Toronto, will demand sacrifices and adhering to strict guidelines, which suits Shaw just fine.

“It is a short time. It’s only three months. I think we can get through it.”",[],1007,0.8780409255257065

For the first time since a win over Rudy Gobert and the Utah Jazz on March 9, the Raptors took the court as a team for a practice in Orlando in advance of the NBA’s season resuming with scrimmages later this month. By all accounts, despite an expected bit of rust, the team looked pretty good.

“It felt good, it’s been awhile,” said starting guard Fred VanVleet. “I think you saw some rust, some excitement, and that first day of school type of thing for everybody, coaches and players,” he said.

“We’ve got to flush some things out these next couple of weeks and get ready to play, but kind of take a marathon approach still, we’ve still got a long way to go.”

VanVleet said he hadn’t yet seen much of the NBA’s setup because the team had just gotten out of quarantine Saturday morning after arriving from their previous training location elsewhere in Florida (where they could only do individual work).

“I think we’ll have more things to do, we’ll kind of walk around and more controlled. When we were in Naples, we couldn’t control everybody else, I think everybody inside of this bubble is under the same guidelines, so that’s probably the biggest difference,” VanVleet said of what life will be like for the team.

On the court, head coach Nick Nurse said he pushed them a little harder than he initially anticipated and there are plenty of things to work on, but, “from a starting point it seems like a really good jumping off point today for us,” Nurse said.

“I started heavier than normal and just told the guys to please self-monitor and let’s not get carried away, we got a long way to go here today.”

Still, Nurse saw what he always does, a smart, savvy, professional group.

“We’ll find a way, we’ll manage a way to do some experimenting as well as we put the pieces of the puzzle back together (during this second training camp),” Nurse said.

“I think that’s going to go fast, I sensed a lot of guys grasping all our set calls and all our defensive coverages, it was pretty good.”

If everything goes smoothly, Toronto will scrimmage against the Houston Rockets on July 24 in the team’s first quasi game action.

Way back in October the Raptors and Rockets opened the pre-season with a pair of games in Japan.

“I never really looked at it that way,” Nurse said.

“That does seem like a long, long time ago, that we were in Tokyo. And we always like to see the Rockets, so we’ll look forward to that first scrimmage.”

But first, there’s quite a bit of work to be done.

NOT EASING IN

Every though it was the first day of practice in months, the competitive juices were immediately flowing for the Raptors.

“It’s good that we’re back here. We just wanna play,” said all-star forward Pascal Siakam.

“Everyone is excited about playing. That’s what you wanna see. It gets a little intense every time you get on the floor. It doesn’t matter how long you were off. Once you get on that floor, the competitive spirit comes out and everyone wants to win, and that’s what you wanna see from a team.”

For one of the only times in 2019-20, the full roster is intact at the moment. Just about every key player, save for OG Anunoby, missed substantial time due to injury.

“We haven’t really had a full team all year, so it will be interesting to see what that looks like for a long stretch of time,” VanVleet said.

The guard added Nurse mixed up the lineups, not playing the expected starting five together on Monday.

WAITING IS THE HARDEST PART

Kyle Lowry was originally slated to address the media on Saturday, but the new plan is a Monday media session, with Marc Gasol going Sunday. Despite being the team’s leaders, most decorated and most experienced veterans, neither has talked since the season shut down months ago, which has forced some teammates like VanVleet, Norman Powell and Siakam to be quite busy fulfilling media obligations.

On another note, Siakam declined to disclose what the back of his jersey would say (the NBA is allowing players to have social justice messages on their jerseys in light of the movements taking place around the world), but said there have been many discussions as a team.

“I’m definitely not the spokesperson for it. I think we have a lot of plans,” Siakam said. “Together as a team we have a whole committee working on it. I think once it’s time, you guys are gonna see what we have. I think everyone is mindful of it from management, ownership, everyone is really involved into it. We just want to do everything we can to make a change. We’re just gonna have to see … You’ll see soon.”

THE PROCESS

The Raptors arrived in Orlando on Thursday and immediately went for testing. They were tested again on Friday night and Nurse said they “got the all-clear around 10:30 or 11 (Saturday) morning.”

He said there was a bit of anxiety and was very thankful everyone was OK.

As for another two days of quarantining? Siakam said it was no big deal.

“I didn’t get out for like three months or two months, so I’m used to it,” he said.

“Two days is nothing. It went by quick, found things to do, like video games, anything I can do to let time fly. And just being ready mentally and being excited about being back together as a team. We just wanna play, man. I miss playing basketball. It definitely felt like a basketball atmosphere (on Saturday), and that’s all I really care about.”

Home being their own bubble of teammates and staff, their hotel rooms, the practice gym and the odd trip to the cafeteria for meals.

Certainly head coach Nick Nurse and rookie Terence Davis, the two Raptors made available to the media Sunday following practice have no immediate desire to see the sights just now.

“Getting out on campus, it’s not really ideal right now,” Davis said. “I’m just trying to get the hang of things and how things are going, like breakfast is sometimes in my room and sometimes it’s in the meal room. So, just really getting the hang of things right now. Maybe I’ll venture out but right now it’s really about business.”

Nurse is taking a similar cautious approach.

“I have not been out to look around, I did take the outside path down to the meal room last night, but that was just right along the same hallway, that was as far as I ventured outside, I’m not planning on doing much looking around, to be honest with you,” Nurse said. “I’m good with working and getting back to the room, to be honest with you.”

These are early days in the bubble and you can’t blame the Raptors for being careful. Unlike a lot of teams coming into the bubble, they did so fully healthy without a single positive case for coronavirus among them.

The plan is to keep it that way so it only makes sense to keep their distance early on until the testing ferrets out any potential unhealthy bubble dwellers.

EASING INTO ACTION

The Raptors on the court are also taking an early cautious approach easing into activity after the extended, for them unnatural, break from strenuous physical activity.

Nurse is taking things nice and slowly for his returning players and letting them tell him when they’ve had enough.

“I’ve asked the guys to really self-monitor themselves, especially the veteran guys and ease into things here a little bit,” the Raptors head coach said. “I’ve tried to get to kind of the majority of the action early in practice to avoid fatigue and get to the main part, I think they need to play.

“Marc (Gasol) went for a good stretch of practice, the main bits and just like I suggested, took himself out to kind of ease into it. I think OG (Anunoby) did later on in the practice as well. Just again, I’m really leaving it to them, they know their bodies best and how they’re feeling.”

Nurse remains very happy with what he has seen from his team.

“Intensity was super high, I thought, especially for this early in the morning and it was a good one, a good effort and again just getting a lot of things in,” he said. “Pretty happy, just looking at some of our foundational stuff, I see it already appearing so it’s a good start for two days.”

SETTING THE BAR

Not only do the Raptors have their championship pedigree to sell to would-be free agents, but their reputation as a franchise that goes the extra mile for its staff and players is getting plenty of attention these days.

The buses the team used to roll up from Naples to Orlando were one of those things. Painted up with ‘Black Lives Matter’ on both sides of their transport from Naples, the buses caught the attention of Sixers guard Matisse Thybulle, who is doing a podcast from inside the bubble.

Thybulle is on the phone with a teammate who asks him “You seen the bus for the Toronto Raptors, man?”

Thybulle responds “Yeah, amazing, amazing.”

His teammate then says “Our team has to do something man.”

The Raptors burnished their own well-thought-of reputations within their own team as well when the staff had framed photographs of each team member and his family waiting for them in their hotel rooms when they checked in.

“They had pictures set up, one of me and my son and then one of all my family members at a college game,” Davis said. “It meant a lot, man. It felt like they really care. Just seeing the pictures, it was heart-warming. Obviously I miss my son every day, just being without him, but one day he’ll understand what daddy does for a living.”

You’ve done nothing but talk about me behind my back. Consistently. I’ve always kept my mouth shut and let it slide. Ask YOUR teammates and Canada who they rather have on their team…you or me. I already know the answer. Continue to under achieve and talk shit about teammates! — Marcus Stroman (@STR0) July 11, 2020

Stroman then went on the attack, stating that Grichuk has “done nothing but talk about me behind my back” consistently.

“I’ve always kept my mouth shut and let it slide,” said Stroman. “Ask YOUR teammates and Canada who they rather have on their team … you or me. I already know the answer. Continue to under achieve and talk s— about teammates!”

Grichuk is no stranger when it comes to Twitter beefs with fellow MLB players. He and Stroman continued to trade barbs.

“Haha keep thinking that’s true,” he said. “Don’t be mad at me because I liked a tweet that was the truth. Have a good day my man.”

Stroman managed to get the last word.

“My day is beyond great. Good luck playing for a nation that now knows your true colours. Have a splendid day my G!” said Stroman.

Stroman played for the Blue Jays for five seasons before being traded to the Mets in 2019. As a Jay, Stroman posted a 3.76 ERA.

Tiger gets teased ... Day has low score theory,'Jon Mccarthymore Jon Mccarthy',2020-07-13 02:40:31+00:00,"The PGA Tour restart has been thrilling, but the Workday Charity Open took the excitement to a new level Sunday — even without fans, and even with the leaders teeing off at 9 a.m. to avoid an ominous afternoon weather forecast.

As storm clouds finally rolled into Muirfield Village in Ohio shortly before 3 p.m., 23-year-old Collin Morikawa prevailed on the third playoff hole over Justin Thomas to win for the second time of his young career.

“It was crazy,” Morikawa said just after his round. “I got off to a really good start, and thinking back, 75 holes is a lot more than 72 for sure, especially the last three in sudden death. I just knew I had to go low. Justin wasn’t going to give it to me.”

It was a day full of numerous lead changes, but the pair headed to extra holes deadlocked at 19-under par after world No. 5 Thomas blew a three-shot lead, including a missed birdie putt on the 72nd green.

Playing the 18th hole for the second time of the day, the 27-year-old Thomas looked to have redeemed himself, draining perhaps the loudest putt ever on an empty golf course with a 50-foot birdie bomb on the first playoff hole. The 12-time tour winner screamed, “C’MON!” and the pressure switched to Morikawa who followed it up with a 25-foot birdie putt of his own to stay alive.

Playing the 18th for the third time of the day, Thomas had a nine-foot birdie putt to win on playoff hole No. 2, but missed, sending the duo to the 10th tee for another extra hole.

Thomas showed little control over his tee shots late in the round and it finally stung him when his drive finished directly behind a tree, while Morikawa found the fairway. Thomas was forced to punch out with his second shot, and Morikawa — whose iron play is among the best on tour — hit another wonderful approach that finished just nine feet from the hole.

A day full of drama ended quietly when Thomas missed his par putt, leaving Morikawa to two-putt from nine feet for the victory.

“It’s completely unacceptable to give up a three-shot lead with three to go,” Thomas said. “I’m upset, I’m disappointed in myself, but at the end of the day it’s over with now, and I just need to take some time this afternoon and tonight to build on it and figure out what I can do better going into next week.”

Morikawa becomes the first to two wins of the superstar-in-the-making class of youngsters that includes Viktor Hovland and Matthew Wolff. The Los Angeles native, who starred at the University of California, began his career by making an incredible 22 cuts in a row before finally missing one at the Travelers Championship two weeks ago. It’s safe to say Morikawa made amends and he now has more PGA tour wins (2) than missed cuts (1).

With majors around the corner, it’s also safe to say the kids have arrived.

“This is a huge kind of stepping-stone,” Morikawa said. “We got No. 1 out of the way, we got No. 2, let the gates just open and let’s just keep going.”

The playoff almost wasn’t to be when Morikawa nearly lipped-out a two-foot par putt on the 72nd hole. It brought back memories of the Charles Schwab Challenge that kicked off the tour’s restart where Morikawa missed a three-foot putt to lose in a playoff against Daniel Berger.

Hovland finished alone in third at 15-under par. Chase Seiffert finished one shot further back at 14 under. Gary Woodland and Ian Poulter rounded out the top five at 12 under.

The Workday Charity Open was a one-off event to replace the cancelled John Deere Classic, and the PGA Tour will stay at Muirfield Village another week as Jack Nicklaus’ Memorial Tournament begins Thursday. It will be the same golf course but a different tournament as organizers promise to bring faster greens and longer rough — not to mention Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.

OH, CANADA

The week began with great promise for Canadians at the tournament with Adam Hadwin and Nick Taylor sitting in second and third place, respectively, after the opening round. In fact, all six Canucks in the field were in red numbers after Thursday’s round.

The weekend wasn’t great, though, as none of them broke 70 on moving day Saturday, with only Roger Sloan under par for the third round. Both Hadwin and Taylor shot 4-over 76s on Saturday to shoot themselves off the leaderboard.

Sloan was the top Canadian for the week, finishing at 7 under and in a tie for 27th. Hadwin was the low Canuck on Sunday with a 4-under 68 to finish at 5 under for the week and in a tie for 35th. Corey Conners finished the week at 4 under, while Taylor and Mackenzie Hughes finished at 3-under par. David Hearn missed the cut.

Hadwin, Taylor, Conners and Hughes are in the field at this week’s Memorial Tournament.

TIGER TEASING

Thomas was feeling good enough about his game on the weekend at Muirfield to take a few shots at his pal Tiger.

Woods is making his PGA Tour restart debut this week at the Memorial, a tournament he has won five times.

Thomas said he hasn’t seen the 15-time major winner since he was an on-course analyst for the Woods-Mickelson/Brady-Manning match in May.

“I’m glad that he’s finally coming back out,” Thomas said. “I think he was starting to get a little sassy, I was telling him he’s scared to come out and play against all of us when he’s sitting at home just trying to give him a hard time. But yeah, we’re excited to have him out.”

Woods hasn’t played a tournament since the Genesis Invitational five months ago, having skipped the WGC Mexico Championship, the Honda Classic, the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the Players Championship with a sore back.

DAY’S LOW-SCORE THEORY

Jason Day has an idea about why scores have been so low during the PGA Tour restart. The former World No. 1 thinks that many players are playing with an unusual calm because the tour has stated that nobody will lose their tour playing status at the end of this strange COVID-19 interrupted season. He also thinks the lack of fans makes it easier for young players.

“That’s why you see a lot of names that usually probably aren’t there that are up there playing well,” Day said. “They have a free year in regards to they don’t have to worry about keeping their card because they’ve got a card through to the end of next season. There’s no fans out here. I think the fans add a lot more pressure to the actual event. So I’m missing the fans. There’s guys out here that are just kind of free-wheeling it because of those two factors.”

After missing three of four cuts during the restart, the 33-year-old Day shot a 5-under 67 on Sunday to finish at 11 under and in a tie for seventh giving him some optimism heading into this week’s event. Day managed to to finish inside the top 10 despite hitting seven balls in the water over the week.",[],1184,0.9433675797783919

Fortunately for all concerned, there were no major injuries.

In the final race of the afternoon, the three-year-old bay filly Society’s Story got out of the gate from the No. 3 position in good shape. But not long into the race, she suddenly veered to her left sharply and crashed into the rail, dislodging her jockey Darryll Holland in the process.

Thankfully, both the horse and rider escaped serious injury.

“He’s OK, just bruised up,” said Mike Luider, Holland’s agent. “He went home under his own steam.”

Society’s Story is owned by Joey Gee Thoroughbreds, trained by Terry Brooker and had posted a pair of second-place showings at Woodbine this season.

Holland joined the Woodbine jockey colony full time this season and has two wins, has placed second five times and has been third five times in 54 starts heading into Sunday’s races.

The English rider has ridden some great horses in his career, most notably Falbrav, who won the Queen Elizabeth (G1), Eclipse (G1) and International Stakes (G1), all in 2003.

The 47-year-old jock brought his tack to Woodbine this season after competing all over the world. Holland has been one of Europe’s top jockeys for the past two decades and has won Group 1 races in more than a dozen nations. He was Great Britain’s top apprentice in 1991.

The circus that is the MLS is Back tournament.

Since Major League Soccer kick-started the continuation of its season last Wednesday with a World Cup-style tournament at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, the event has been plagued by coronavirus-related nightmares — with Toronto FC caught in the middle of this unfunny clown show.

Early Sunday morning, the scheduled match between TFC and D.C. United was postponed. Under the league’s health and safety protocols, clubs are tested the day before each match. The results of Saturday’s tests for D.C. United and Toronto FC produced an initial unconfirmed positive COVID-19 case for a D.C. United player and an inconclusive test for a Toronto player, resulting in the postponement of Sunday’s game.

Both teams participated in another round of testing Sunday and the players from the two clubs tested negative. The TFC-D.C. United game will now be played Monday morning at 9 a.m.

The D.C. United player who tested positive and the Toronto player whose test was inconclusive will undergo additional testing and will not play in Monday’s match.

The Reds’ second group stage match against the Montreal Impact has been moved to Thursday at 8 p.m. and, if the TFC player tests negative a second time, he can play in that game. The match against Montreal was originally scheduled for Wednesday.

TFC GM Ali Curtis did not disclose the name of the Toronto player whose first test was inconclusive. That player will not play in Monday’s game and is currently in isolation.

“These days, nothing’s really normal. If anything, the normal is uncertainty,” Curtis said on a Zoom call Sunday night. “You just have to adapt.

“I think the (TFC) staff and the players have done a good job of that,” he added. “We’re excited to play and to compete and we’ve got a group that have been through a lot of different moments in different times. But they love football, they love to play and so we’re excited about (Monday) and look forward to the challenge.”

Curtis said the club learned of the Toronto player’s inconclusive (or presumptive positive) test around midnight on Saturday, adding that the player in question was not experiencing any symptoms.

“I think we’re all trying to wrap our heads around this and get prepared for the game,” said Curtis, who added that his confidence level with the safety protocols at the MLS is Back tournament is “very high” and that the team is comfortable in their own little hotel bubble.

“It’s an important competition. A lot of people put a lot of work and effort into preparing for (the tournament) it so it’s important that we represent the club and our city as best as we can.”

Still, one has to question the sanity of continuing the MLS is Back tournament in Florida. FC Dallas and Nashville SC withdrew after several of their players tested positive for COVID-19 just before their first matches, forcing cancellations of games.

A number of MLS players — including five from the Vancouver Whitecaps — have opted out of the tournament because of anxiety over COVID-19 or for personal reasons and other players have tested positive.

To top it off, the state of Florida on Sunday reported a record 15,300 new COVID-19 cases, the most by any state in a single day since the pandemic reached the United States. Yet MLS continues to take the Animal House “All is well” approach to the event.

“We believe the tournament can still be conducted safely,” MLS deputy commissioner Mark Abbott insisted. “And if at the point we determine it can’t, obviously we would make a decision then.”

TFC and D.C. United were originally supposed to play last Friday night, but the match was postponed to Sunday morning after Toronto arrived in Florida late after a member of the “travel party” came down with “symptoms”.

TFC coach Greg Vanney has expressed some real concerns about being in Florida – even though the clubs are in the so-called “bubble” at the ESPN complex. Neither Vanney nor his players are impressed with the 9 a.m. starts of some of their scheduled games.

The tournament is being held behind closed doors from July 8 to August 11 at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. The tournament features a group stage, which will count toward the 2020 MLS regular-season standings, followed by knockout rounds. The tournament champion will qualify for the 2021 CONCACAF Champions League and the 2020 season is scheduled to resume upon completion of the tournament.",[],759,0.836430736398551
345,https://driving.ca/column/lorraine/lorraine-explains-hate-speed-cameras-just-dont-speed/,6,car drive rear wheel seat race driver road,363,torontosun,Lorraine Explains: Hate speed cameras? Just don't speed,'Lorraine Sommerfeld',2020-07-13 10:23:05+00:00,"Speed cameras are money traps. Same with red-light cameras, hidden radar traps, or getting a ticket when you’re in a no-parking zone even though you had your four-way flashers on. Waaah. Shut up.

Effective at the end of last year, Ontario made it legal for all municipalities to install speed cameras in school zones and designated community safety zones if they wanted to. Most are. I certainly hope they’re smart enough to recognize that seniors bear the brunt of our pedestrian fatalities, and that they decide they should protect them, too.

While a global pandemic that would drain government coffers was just a twinkle in our eye back when the bill was passed, there’s no arguing speed cameras are an easy way to start to replenish them, even a little. The proof will be in where they show up, and if they are indeed being used to protect the most vulnerable.

While the COVID-19 lockdown resulted in some interesting changes on our roadways – speeders way, way up, but pedestrian fatalities way, way down – most came about due, no doubt, to the rapid, extensive reduction of vehicles actually on the road.

The speed camera discussions that were paused are now back in full force. Major cities everywhere struggle with the fact it’s seemingly impossible to get those piloting cars and SUVs to slow down and stop killing pedestrians and cyclists. Lowered speed limits, traffic calming zones, and campaigns like Vision Zero are really a bunch of carrots. Cameras that indiscriminately record those breaking the law and send out a ticket? There’s the stick you need.

Five years ago I wrote that instigating 30 km/h speed limits was a noble but futile exercise unless you were going to enforce it. Constantly. Roads are engineered for certain speeds, and artificially dropping that speed makes little sense to our caveman brains. You don’t do 60 km/h in a parking lot, because your brain tells you you can’t. But a broad boulevard? We need a reason other than “because we said so” to gain consistent, predictable responses. Threat of a ticket for going even one kilometre over the limit is the reason.

The new fines in Ontario will be $5 per km/h over, from one to 19 km/h over; $7.50 per for 20 to 29 km/h over; $12 each click for 30 to 49 km/h over; and if you hit 50 kilometres over, see ya in court. Tickets will be mailed out to the registered owner of the car. Because of that, no demerits will apply, and your insurance won’t be impacted. This will trigger some interesting dinner conversations for those who let others drive their cars.

The fact it can take 23 days for the ticket to land in your mailbox is the world’s worst pregnant pause. If you hide a ticket from the registered owner (if I’m a kid, you better believe I’m considering that) know that come sticker renewal time, unpaid fines will stop the process.

There is no better reason to launch speed cameras than the fact we need to better protect our most vulnerable road users. People do slow down when they know they will face financial consequences otherwise.

Lowered speed limits and traffic calming zones are really a bunch of carrots—cameras that record law-breakers and send out a ticket? There’s the stick you need

They are never a popular political decision, though a four-year British study by the Royal Automobile Club Foundation found two things: the cameras reduce fatalities; and decommissioning the cameras can raise them again. Their findings were consistent with 17 similar studies. Shorter version: if people know the cameras are there, they adjust their behaviour accordingly. When they know they’re not, they revert to form.

Many of us say in a perfect policing world, there would be no bias in who gets pulled over, who gets a warning, who gets nailed for the whole thing.

Cameras don’t give a toot who is behind the wheel, making this option a seemingly perfect solution to busting speeders. But we have to flip it over and look on the other side. With no demerits or insurance implications, it favours those who can buy their way out of the situation. I worked for a rich guy once who considered his (insane) speeding simply the cost of doing business. There goes your egalitarian compromise out the sunroof.

Alberta is revamping their speed camera operations at this time, making sure the focus is on safety and avoiding the look of a cash grab. Or trying to. There are those who will forever see cameras – including red light and speed ones – as only that.

My own thinking has evolved over the past twenty years as I realize manufacturers are making vehicles that allow us to walk away from crashes that once would have been fatal; we persist in finding ways to kill each other anyway. Cameras are being installed in designated community safety and school zones; there are signs pointing them out to you; word goes out when they’re going to move them. If this is a “gotcha,” I was taught the wrong meaning of the word.

Will I be writing in this space soon that I’ve received a speeding ticket caught on camera? Maybe. It’s not hard to go a few kilometres over the limit. But our streets need to be made safer, and because we believe we need cars to be travelling in the same spaces as unprotected road users, we brought this on ourselves.",[],903,0.95369800621324

As it happens, manufacturers know not all pickups will lead a semi-charmed life of shuttling kids to the rink and making Costco runs on weekends.

That’s why it remains possible to configure full-size light-duty trucks for labour, not luxury.

They make up a small but important percentage of the product mix, inhabiting our nation’s job sites while ferrying hard-working Canadians to the oil patch or construction areas.

We’ve delved into each of the five models available in today’s so-called ‘half-ton’ class, choosing specs designed to help customers get the job done, not impress the neighbours. Where possible, the trucks in this list will have four-wheel-drive and an eight-foot bed.

Why? The former is needed to claw oneself out of places like the muddy land around Firebag in northern Alberta; while the latter remains a standard for getting work done.

In what might be a world-first for a post about trucks, we’re gonna quote RuPaul: you better work.

Note: The MSRPs listed here are lifted straight from manufacturer build-and-price sites for 2020 models, exclusive of freight, taxes, and available rebates.

Ford F-150 XL 4×4 — $37,639

It’s not a stretch to estimate the Ford F-150 is available in tens of millions of configurations, at least when one counts individual options and paint choices. The new 2021 F-150 was recently revealed to much fanfare, complete with gee-whiz features and more luxury than ever.

Fortunately for the use-’em-for-work crowd, it’s still available as a regular-cab pickup with an eight-foot box. And, yes, we’re well aware the image shown here is of a Crew Cab; it’s the most basic exterior image the Blue Oval has released of the 2021 model. Check the regular-cab XL interior below.

What we do know is Ford has promised even the most basic work trucks will come equipped with a 4-inch productivity screen in the instrument cluster; and an 8-inch center stack touchscreen. We look forward to seeing this for ourselves. This pairs well with selectable drive modes, SYNC 4 infotainment, and a wireless phone connection. Powertrains for the new truck seem to be similar to 2020, save for the new hybrid, so we’ll look to that model year for guidance.

If choosing XL 4×4 trim and the base 290-hp 3.3L V6 engine, be sure to select the 3.73 electronic-locking rear axle. At just $500, it adds well over a ton of towing capacity, maxing out at 7,400 lbs. The $235 BoxLink cargo management system and its locking cleats aren’t a bad idea, either.

Ram 1500 Classic ST 4×4 — $44,615

At Ram, the naming conventions are slightly murky and require a bit of explaining. The company is currently in the throes of making two completely separate 1500-series pickup trucks: one that was new last year; and one that still uses a body style introduced in 2009. Only the latter is available for 2020 in a regular cab with an eight-foot box. The base engine here is a 3.6L 295-hp V6 mated to an eight-speed automatic.

Ram doesn’t seem to offer different rear axle ratios in this spec of truck but does list an anti-spin diff as a $525 option. For $700, Ram will upgrade the ST to a Tradesman which includes a towing hitch and boxliner. Annoyingly, cloth seats are an extra-charge option, bringing floor carpet with them. Good thing the latter can be deleted separately.

They also have the good taste to place a broad colour palette on the base ST, though the unlovely black plastic ‘face’ only blends well with black or grey paint. This is true for all entry-level trucks from the Detroit Three, however.

Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra WT 4×4 — $35,498/$36,698

The twins from General Motors are virtually identical in terms of their mechanicals, though the styling choices are quite different. Both of them are equipped with a 4.3L 285-hp V6 engine as standard Work Truck equipment, paired with a six-speed automatic and active fuel management technology that can shut down a bank of cylinders to save on go-juice.

The beds of the Chevy and GMC trucks are peppered with a dozen tie-downs and boast a wider maximum width on its load floor than Ford or Ram. A single rear axle ratio is offered, meaning all Silverado/Sierra pickups of this configuration can tow 7,700 lbs. Cloth seats show up at no extra charge, while the grand sum of $450 imbues the thing with a factory tow hitch and guidance lines in the rear-view camera display.

An optional Work Truck Package including tough skid plates and a more robust air filter (offered on its own for $40) is advertised at $230 but requires the selection of different tires. If one does check this box, go for the more aggressive LT-rated all-terrain tires for maximum traction. An automatic-locking Eaton-branded rear diff is available as a standalone option for $450.

Toyota Tundra Double Cab 4×4 — $46,420

The crew at Toyota doesn’t offer the four-wheel drive Tundra as a regular cab truck anymore, forcing the selection of a Double Cab model with a 6.5-ft bed. This also brings a 5.7L 381-hp V8 engine, helping to explain the price differential between this rig and the rest of the pickups on this list. Unlike those workhorses, few individual powertrain options are provided, leaving us to talk about dealer-installed accessories such as a $600 performance air intake system.

For the sake of $290, spec the SX package, which does little for its work ethic but adds fog lamps and colour-keyed addenda. It does, however, add 18-inch tires. Do note that if four-wheel-drive is not an absolute necessity (a no-go area for most, we know) then the Tundra is available in 2020 as a Double Cab with an eight-foot box. This unicorn will likely be a special order truck and is priced a hefty $6,000 south of the 4×4 Double Cab.

Nissan Titan Crew Cab S 4×4 — $50,498

Like the Toyota, this built-in-Mississippi Titan is no longer available as a regular cab long box pickup. Its entry-level model is called the S and has the brand’s 5.6L 400-hp V8 stuffed under its hood. Note that accessing all those horses requires premium fuel. A new nine-speed automatic takes care of shifting duties.

There are no optional packages on the base S, let alone any that improve the truck in meaningful work-related ways. This is thanks to the company streamlining its models for ease of choice (and production), meaning all Titans can tow around 9,000 lbs or bear a payload of 1,580 lbs. Nissan’s comprehensive warranty is longest in terms of distance when compared to other half-ton pickups, stretching to 160,000 km.",[],1098,0.9357653005610562

This is the basis of my theory that most of shoppers buy their vehicle first, and then find out some time later how well its headlights perform — or don’t.

Headlight performance is a vital part of safety and driver comfort, but most never actually try them out before buying. Good headlights can make all the difference, especially if you’re frequently out and about after dark. On a long, nighttime drive, the performance of your car’s lighting system can play a major role in safety, alertness, eye fatigue, and your overall well being.

My dad is a thrifty guy, but as a kid, he taught me there are three things you don’t cheap out on: winter boots, tires, and headlight bulbs. This is probably why for years, I’ve been fascinated by headlight performance and tech. When I was a kid, it was halogen bulbs in everything — they create light by running current through a wire to heat it up, so it glows bright white and hot. Halogen lighting is cheap and useful, but also has to be replaced relatively often since they burn out.

Next came high-intensity discharge (HID) lights, which worked by creating an electric arc in a capsule of gas — creating lighting in a bottle, literally. This tech was the foundation of the majority of high-end automotive lighting systems for a very long time.

Today, the light-emitting diode (LED) is an increasingly common means of lighting the road ahead. They’re made of special materials that emit plenty of light when even just a little bit of current is applied. Also, LEDs last a very long time, don’t get hot, and are highly energy efficient. Best of all, they pack a highly illuminating punch for their size, meaning you can get more light from a physically smaller system that fits into a tighter space. This expands the possibilities for styling and shaping the front end of your ride.

LED lighting is common nowadays, and most systems are very good. Awestruck, I first encountered LED headlights in an Audi R8 quite some years ago, but today, they’re standard kit in a very wide range of vehicles you and I can afford. See, cars like the R8 serve as a technological gene pool from which future products will draw. Once the stuff of big-dollar premium machinery, the LED headlight is basically everywhere today.

And that’s good news for you, if you’re buying a new (or recent used) car. First, it was the Acura ILX. Then, the Mazda CX-9 and Ford Mustang. One by one, month by month, I started to notice really good headlights becoming more common at lower price points, and across more and more of the 50-ish vehicles I review each year.

A 2017 Toyota Corolla really drove the point home: on one evening drive, I remember thinking the LED headlamps in this $25,000 Corolla were performing in the same ballpark as what I’d observed in a nearly six-figure Mercedes just a few days earlier. More recently, the Nissan Kicks (about $23,000) impressed with a very powerful-for-the-price LED lighting system. Ditto the new Chevrolet Silverado and Hyundai Sonata, and especially the Jeep Wrangler.

A $995 option on my tester, the Wrangler’s optional LED lighting package parks drivers behind the same sort of clean, vivid, thick white light I expect from a twice-the-price BMW. Sure, they’re not exactly giving away Wranglers — but the point is that you used to have to pay six figures for lighting this good, and today, you can find it for under $30,000 all day long.

So, by putting better lighting than ever at lower price points than ever, you get added confidence on after-dark drives, improved safety, and better return on your investment. Better lighting helps sell cars, too — even indirectly. Nowadays, earning certain coveted safety ratings requires a strong performance from a vehicle’s safety and structural systems, as well as its headlights.

Not all lighting systems are equal, though, LED or otherwise. Numerous variables affect how the lighting system in your car performs, but you know it when you see it. Personally, I look for three things.

First is how much light I get into culverts and treelines beside the highway, and how far it reaches into my peripheral vision. That’s vital for early warning of wildlife that could be planning to sprint in front of you, which is a big deal in northern Ontario, where I’m from.

Second, the colour. Great lights give off a clean, pure, white light that’s as clean and bright as a welding flash. Where some lighting systems give off dull orange or yellow hues, a great lighting system’s pure white light helps fend off eye fatigue and improve alertness, as you’ll be straining less to see details far up the road.

Third? Reach. How far ahead can I see? How far ahead are reflective signs engaged, and how strongly? Does turning on the high beams affect the lighting directly in front of the car? Am I being flashed for dazzling other drivers? A headlight system with a strong reach that doesn’t irritate other drivers is a beautiful thing.

One final note: online owner forums or Facebook communities can be a great place to post questions about a model you’re considering buying. If you like, you could join one such group and ask the owners what they think of the night-time drive of the model you’re considering.

I’ll leave you with a partial gallery of the best lighting systems I’ve encountered on recent test-drives. This list is based solely on test drives made in the past two to three years, and includes models with standard or optionally-installed LED lighting provisions.",[],949,0.9463468791605982

Whole books exist on the topic, in fact.

The brand’s advertising story begins in earnest in the late ’50s and early ’60s, with the Volkswagen North America ads created by Manhattan advertising agency Doyle Dane Bernback (DDB). With a nominal budget, DDB adopted a clever, minimalist approach that resulted in fresh ads that cut through the clutter with a tone bordering on self-deprecation.

Since then, the VW-DBB romance (which still burns today) has churned out dozens of witty, funny or otherwise evocative advertising content in print and video around the world.

Here’s a look back at some of the automotive giant’s most memorable and impactful advertising across all mediums throughout the years. Don’t see your favourite Volkswagen commercial on the list? Drop a link in the comments!

Think Small

1959, print

This is it, the ad that changed it all. And not just for the Beetle, which was trying to shake its reputation as a car made in Nazi Germany; or for Volkswagen; or for DDB, but for the entire advertising industry. The simple, barren ad concept that utilized nearly a full page of white space flew in the face of typical print ads of the time, which were inundated with details, information and fantastical proposals.

Lemon

1959, print

Another product of the brilliant DDB team lead by creative director Bill Bernbach, and released at the same time as the “Think Small” ad, the “Lemon” print run positions the Beetle as a premium product by owning up to the rigorous final inspection process which combed back one in 50 cars, the “lemons,” for adjustment.

Dustin Hoffman

1966, television

Here’s a fun fact: Before Dustin Hoffman was an Academy Award winner, he was a commercial actor for Volkswagen. At the age of 29, with a few off-Broadway gigs and nominal TV appearances under his belt, the 5’6” actor was used to demonstrate the roominess of the Volkswagen Fastback Sedan.

Wilt Chamberlain

1966, television and print

VW also leaned on some celebrities from the sporting world for its ’60s television campaigns. This ad shows Wilt Chamberlain attempting and failing to shoehorn his 7-foot frame into the driver’s seat of the Beetle.

“When 7’1” Wilt Chamberlain tried to get into a Volkswagen, people said it couldn’t be done. It couldn’t,” ran the copy. But then Bill Cunningham hops in the driver’s seat, showing there is enough room for an average 6’6” person.

Changes

1987, television

To launch the second generation of the Golf, Volkswagen hired model Paula Hamilton to play the part of a distraught wife in the midst of a possession cleanse. She discards her wedding ring, tosses her pearl necklace and brooch, gives the cat the stink eye, and is about to throw her car keys down a storm drain when she hesitates. The video ends with her driving away, smiling and the line “If only everything in life was as reliable as a Volkswagen.”

David Kramer South Africa

1990, television

In something of a departure from the brand’s other hit ads, VW South Africa wrote a fun little diddy, hired South African comedian David Kramer, and filmed this ridiculous ballad to the 4X4 Volkswagen Bus Syncro. Is it clever? Not particularly. Will you watch it twice in a row and then send it to your buddy who owns a Vanagon? Definitely.

Un-pimp Your Ride

2006, television

Fast-forward to the arrival of the 21st century and Volkswagen’s ads remain in tandem step with pop culture. For the “Unpimp Your Auto” series, heavily accented actor Peter Stormare spoofs on a popular TV show at the time, Pimp My Ride, by destroying some early 2000s-bro-stereotypes’ flashy aftermarket specials and presenting them with some proper German engineering. Here’s the whole series in one YouTube cut.

Old Lady

2011, television

DDB Amsterdam hit a home run by playing off another stereotype: the old lady driver. The ad suggests the young man shopping with his father is about to get the deal of the decade by scooping up a gently used Golf, but then we flash back and see the car’s usage wasn’t all that “gentle” at all. The Dutch phrase at the end translates to “Not every old lady is as reliable as the Golf.”

Fast Just Got Faster

2016, print

When the three-door, no-longer-for-North-America Scirocco got beefed up in 2016, DDB Germany conveyed the message with the captivating and kind of unsettling visual of an ostrich wearing a hoodie made from cheetah fur. You just can’t unsee this.

Lemons to Lemonade

2019, print and video

After Dieselgate rocked VW down to its ethos in 2015, the brand took some time to take space before owning up to it in its advertising. But when it did, the self awareness felt very on-brand indeed. “Our biggest mistake has led to the biggest transformation in the company’s history,” Jim Zabel, VW of America’s senior VP of marketing, said in an interview about the campaign’s message and the company’s movement toward electric power.

The print version made the best of the bad situation by updating the iconic “Lemon” Beetle ad with a “Lemonade” tag for the I.D. Buzz. It was supplemented by an even more sombre video component.",[],836,0.970619986944274

That’s it, that’s the whole article.

But seriously, Elon Musk is no stranger to completely wacky Tweets. Recently, he Tweeted about a new product that Tesla was selling, and you might expect that it would be something related to the vehicles that the company sells, such as an over-the-air update, a new feature, or perhaps even a new game for the giant touchscreen.

Nope.

It’s a pair of short shorts with “S3XY” written across the rear, those letters of course chosen for the four models of vehicles that Tesla sells, the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y.

He actually made the price $69.420, which is admittedly hilarious, but it doesn’t even make sense.

It’s not the dumbest product Elon has ever put on sale either, a few years ago he sold a flame thrower branded with the logo from his Boring Company. There’s nothing boring about a flame thrower, even if it really was just a glorified barbecue starter.

However, it sure isn’t the dumbest thing he’s ever Tweeted. He has made countless nerdy posts, meme posts, and some over the top WTF posts, but some of his Tweets have actually caused real damage to his image and his companies’.

Elon even said himself in an interview with his biographer: “You can either say things that are not controversial at all, and then you’re boring, and nobody cares. Some of the things I say, I would like to retract them. It’s not like I stand by all the tweets I’ve ever done. Some of them were definitely extremely dumb.”

So as per Elon’s review of his own page, we’ve decided to do a deep dive, and find some of those tweets that were “extremely dumb”.

Here are five of Elon Musk’s dumbest Tweets.

“Tesla stock price is too high imo”

Tesla stock price is too high imo — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 1, 2020

They say opinions are like buttholes, everybody has one. We’re guessing that a lot of people thought that Elon Musk was a pretty big opinion when he Tweeted that the value of Tesla stock was too high, causing it to drop drastically.

This just seems like a terrible thing to say about your own company. While it might be the opinion of some investors or stock experts, we would guess that it’s generally bad business practice to tell everybody that has a stake in your company that it’s worth too much.

Mere minutes after this Tweet was sent out, the stock price dropped by $15, and then by $30.

Whether or not Musk actually meant for the price to go down as a result of this tweet, this is a shining example of the power of social media.

“Will own no house.”

I am selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 1, 2020

Following some kind of incoherent string of Tweets starting with the previous one on this list, Elon continued to say stranger and stranger things until he reached this doozy, saying that he would be selling almost all of his stuff.

We don’t want to jump to conclusions, but Elon Musk is no stranger to the bud. This is definitely the kind of rambling that we would expect after somebody took a drag from a left handed cigarette, or possibly enjoyed a special brownie.

This was Tweeted right after he had his fifth(?) child, the first with his girlfriend Grimes. In a separate Tweet following this one, he said that his girlfriend is mad at him for the post, and rightly so. How would you feel if right after you had a child with somebody, they told you that they were going to sell all of their possessions and own no house? Mad enough to name your kid after an airplane, I guess.

“The coronavirus panic is dumb”

The coronavirus panic is dumb — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 6, 2020

We understand that most Americans are sick of this horrible global pandemic that we’re all having to deal with, but unfortunately being tired of something isn’t a good enough reason to ignore safety rules and potentially cause it to be prolonged. When has the United States ever listened to common sense though?

Elon Musk’s fans can only be described as fanatic, and will hang on every word that he says, whether it’s good or bad. So for him to publicly downplay a worldwide deadly illness, it’s damaging to the overall efforts that are going to preventing its spread.

Hopefully nobody read this tweet and thought, “Yeah, you’re right Elon!” And if you did think that, go ahead and stuff your head in a dustbin for the remainder of the pandemic, at least you won’t transfer any germs.

“Pedo guy”

In 2018, a group of children in Thailand were trapped in a cave after the water level rose too high. A rescue effort was started to use divers to bring the children out one by one.

After making a bunch of empty promises to help the stuck children, Elon decided instead to just publicly dump on everybody involved in the rescue on Twitter. Great strategy, billionaire.

This tweet was so stupid that Elon deleted it, but luckily once something has been put on the internet, it can never truly be deleted. A screenshot was taken of the Tweet, where Elon calls a life-saving diver a “pedo guy”, which has to be in the hall of fame for one of the dumbest statements ever, let alone tweets.

This tweet was so dumb that it actually got Musk sued for defamation of character, and honestly, we think he deserved it.

Sex tape Autopilot

Turns out there’s more ways to use Autopilot than we imagined — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 9, 2019

While self-driving technology is very impressive, it’s certainly not something that can be totally relied on. Tesla has been the driving factor in autonomous driving tech, but when you’re the first, there’s bound to be some problems. As Tesla owners have found, there are a lot of problems with the system, it can get confused easily, and has not yet reached the level of full self driving.

So despite all of this, some folks on the internet decided that they would make an… ahem, video, of themselves driving a Tesla with Autopilot engaged, while they had no way to intervene with the system if there was an issue.

Elon saw the video and decided to comment on it, but instead of scolding the video makers for using the technology in a completely unsafe (and frankly gross) way, he decided to make a joke about it.",[],1076,0.9648369737315438

Kennedy, Malcolm X dismissed the murder as a case of “the chickens coming home to roost.”

In Spike Lee’s biographical drama, “Malcolm X,” a white teenage girl approaches the angry activist and says: “Excuse me, Mr. X. Hi. I’ve read some of your speeches, and I honestly believe that a lot of what you have to say is true. And I’m a good person, in spite of what my ancestors did, and I just — I wanted to ask you, what can a white person like myself who isn’t prejudiced, what can I do to help you … further your cause?” He stares sternly, and replies, “Nothing.” She leaves in tears.

But Malcolm X changed. He visited Mecca, where he saw people of all colours worshipping together. It changed the way he thought. He repudiated his anger toward whites after discovering that people were more similar than they were different. He renounced the racist ideology of the Nation of Islam, and in doing so knowingly signed his own death warrant. He was assassinated by members of the Nation of Islam.

Alabama Gov. George Wallace, in 1963, proclaimed, “Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever,” at his inauguration, and later stood in a doorway at the University of Alabama to bar blacks from entering. Nine years later, Wallace took a would-be assassin’s bullet, leaving him paralyzed. Older, wiser and chastened by the attempt on his life, Wallace changed. Wallace, one day and without invitation, went to a black church where 300 black clergymen were holding a conference. He asked to speak. Wallace asked for forgiveness. He said to the church leaders, “I never had hate in my heart for any person. But I regret my support of segregation and the pain it caused the black people of our state and nation. … I’ve learned what pain is, and I’m sorry if I’ve caused anybody else pain. Segregation was wrong — and I am sorry.”

The voters in Alabama returned the former governor to office, but this time, he received Black support and made several Black appointments. The damage Wallace did through his actions and rhetoric was profound, and despite the assassination attempt, he lived long enough to undo some of it.

Even a Confederate general can change.

Confederate Gen. William Mahone, one of General Robert E. Lee’s most able commanders, owned slaves before the Civil War. But after the war, he led an interracial political movement. He organized and became the leader of the Readjuster Party, the most successful interracial political alliance in the post-emancipation South. In 1881, Mahone was elected to the U.S. Senate, at the time split 37-37 between Republicans and Democrats. But Mahone aligned with the Republicans, the party founded two decades earlier by Northerners trying to stop the expansion of slavery.

From 1879 through 1883, Mahone’s Readjuster Party dominated Virginia, with a governor in the statehouse, two Readjusters in the U.S. Senate and Readjusters representing six of the state’s 10 congressional districts. Under Mahone’s leadership, his coalition also controlled the state legislature, the courts and many of the state’s coveted federal offices.

The Readjusters established what became Virginia State University, the first state-supported college to train black teachers. Democrats described the hated Readjusters and Republicans as advocates of “black domination.”

What about Lt. Gen. James Longstreet? One of Lee’s favourite generals, Longstreet not only became a Republican after the war and served in Republican administrations but also fought against the racist White League in New Orleans.

After the Civil War, Longstreet moved to New Orleans, where he urged Southerners to support the Republican Party and endorsed their candidate, Ulysses S. Grant, for president in 1868. He commanded blacks in the New Orleans Metropolitan Police Force against the anti-Reconstruction White League (a paramilitary arm of the Democratic Party) at the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874. He was shot and held captive for several days. He accepted political appointments from Republicans, and even dared criticize Gen. Lee. For this “betrayal,” white Southerners pronounced Longstreet a “scalawag” and “leper of the community.”

Where does this viewing of history through the prism of modern-day feelings end? Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once gave advice to a gay young man that today would be heresy. King suggested he battle his feelings, strongly implying that the young man needed therapy and sexual reorientation. Today, that kind of advice gets one branded a Neanderthal. President John F. Kennedy, frustrated with a high-profile Democrat who hadn’t supported his election, threatened to banish him by giving him an obscure ambassadorship to one of the, as Kennedy put it, “boogie republics” in Africa. Tell that to Black Lives Matter.

History is complicated. And history requires perspective and understanding, something sadly lacking in those who seek to erase history by imposing today’s standards of right and wrong.

While he supported one political party, the union he belonged to routinely endorsed a different party. And each election the union would take some of the union dues my dad paid, as well as funds from thousands of other teachers, and give them to a political party that my dad, and likely many other teachers, opposed.

Years later, the unfairness of the situation really struck me.

Why should unions be able to force their members to pay union dues only to turn around and donate some of those funds to political parties and causes that many members did not support? Why not leave the money in each worker’s pocket and let each worker decide for themselves which causes to support?

A bill before the Alberta legislature proposes to put workers back in charge. In fact, public opinion research commissioned by SecondStreet.org shows Canadians support such a change.

Bill 32, the Restoring Balance in Alberta’s Workplaces Act, would let each union member decide if they want to fund their union’s political campaigns and other initiatives that are unrelated to the workplace.

If a union member supports their union’s plan to, say, run political attack ads, he or she would pay their regular union dues plus a top up charge to pay for the attack ads.

And if a union member opposed their union’s attack ads, he or she would only pay the portion of union dues that cover activities that are related to the workplace (bargaining with the employer, settling grievances, etc.)

A recent poll commissioned by SecondStreet.org (conducted by Leger) found that 70% of Canadians do not think union dues should be used for political activities and non-work initiatives. In fact, a slightly higher percentage of unionized workers and former unionized workers oppose such expenditures by unions (72%).

One can see how the Alberta bill could be a hit with many unionized workers right across Canada.

Consider that CUPE Ontario signed on to supporting the Leap Manifesto – a radical environmental agenda that seeks to, among other things, create a society where public transit replaces the need for “more cars.” It’s not hard to imagine a member of CUPE Ontario being married to an autoworker in that province who might take exception to that idea.

Similarly, the union that represents Canada Post employees has supported “peace” flotillas to Gaza in the past. It’s certainly a headscratcher to understand why postal workers in Canada should be forced to fund advocacy activities related to the age-long conflict in the Middle East.

Back in Alberta, the province’s teachers’ union flew in anti-oil speakers David Suzuki and Tzeporah Berman to speak at their events in 2018. Spending union dues on such speakers probably wasn’t too popular a move in households where an Alberta teacher had family members whose livelihood is dependent on a prosperous oil and gas sector.

It should be clear why union bosses are calling the change an “attack” – some of the immense power enjoyed by union leaders will now shift to their members. So what exactly is the problem?

We developed a great friendship. I recently invited another girl, “Trina,” into our friend group. Trina does not work with us, but we have other common interests.

Recently, though, Marilee and Trina seem to have bonded and are gradually excluding me from things — tubing, brunches, beach trips, etc.

I am feeling left out and hurt by this. The only time they do want to hang out with me now is to take part in my photography hobby, which involves using my expensive equipment. I feel like they are taking advantage and don’t actually want to hang out with me. I don’t know what I did wrong.

They’re not trying to hide it from me, either, as I see — almost daily — posts on social media of them together.

At the risk of alienating myself more, I have not confronted them.

Are they trying to be hurtful or are they genuinely oblivious to how their actions could be perceived?

Left Out in Lancaster, PA

Dear Left Out: “The rule of three” refers to the symmetry inherent in a trio. This surfaces in art, music, design – and even comedy (listen to a classic “rim shot” – it’s a three!). The triangle conveys a sort of pleasing and complex balance – and this balance seems to work — except for when it comes to human relationships. That’s when an equilateral triangle becomes an isosceles, often with one person isolated at the farthest point.

This challenging “odd man out” human dynamic happens at every stage of life — from childhood to old age.

I very much doubt that you have done anything wrong. You should accept that these two women seem to have formed an exclusionary friendship.

It doesn’t matter whether they are trying to be hurtful; they are being hurtful. Even if they aren’t being deliberately malicious, at the very least – they simply don’t care how you feel.

Your choices are to swallow your own honest reaction and accept your new status as the equipment provider, or to be honest regarding how this makes you feel. It is brave to admit your own vulnerability, and I think you should, understanding that you cannot change them or urge them away from their friendship with each other.

You say, “I understand that you two have developed a good friendship, but I have to be honest with you – I feel really left out, lately.”

Dear Amy: I am very concerned about your answer to “Anxious,” who was worried about encountering people in stores who were not wearing masks properly.

You wrote: “No, I don’t think you should call out another customer for wearing a mask incorrectly (because this involves them and their body).”

That is not true! The way other people wear their masks affects all of us!

Upset and Concerned

Dear Upset: Absolutely. Many readers contacted me to correct my statement. I concur: Wearing a mask protects others. Absolutely. Although a mask does seem to offer some protection to the person wearing it, I wear my mask for you, and you wear your mask for me.

My point in framing my answer the way I did was to discourage confrontations between people regarding mask-wearing. People who either don’t wear masks at all or who wear masks improperly seem to take the issue very personally, because the mask is (or isn’t) attached to their own face.

I’m not sure what is so frightening about wearing a thin piece of cloth across your nose and mouth in order to help protect others (and yourself) from a potentially dangerous virus, but I believe it is wisest in the moment to give these people a wide berth – yes, to avoid confrontation, and also – importantly — to avoid transmission.

However, if you patronize a business where employees aren’t wearing masks properly, this is an issue that should definitely be brought to the manager’s attention.

Dear Amy: “Caught Couple” described themselves as doctors who treated COVID patients. They were on the fence about whether to attend a large family wedding in another state.

Thank you for responding the way you did! As doctors – they should know that they – and others – are at substantial risk. As you noted, if doctors are unsure about this, what are the rest of us supposed to do?!

She is a compulsive shopper and was shopping almost every day when she was driving. Last year she had a minor car accident that totaled her car, so she does not drive anymore and depends on me to take her for groceries, errands, doctor appointments, etc.

I had to clean out her car, which was so full of stuff that it took me five hours to clean it out. I filled five large garbage bags of trash and 12 boxes of stuff.

I have had to “clean up her mess” many times over the years, sometimes at my insistence, and sometimes because she needs to let someone into her apartment and they can’t get in because of the mess. Clothes are piled on the bed, groceries on the counters, and boxes on the floor.

My daughter, who has helped me clean in the past, has very good organizational skills and works quickly. She has agreed to help me this weekend. (I have a sister who lives locally but isn’t very helpful.)

In the past, Mom has told me that my cleaning makes her anxious.

Should I insist she let us do this? Mom’s apartment makes me sick and I feel so overwhelmed when I am there because it is so bad. I have trouble sleeping because it bothers me so much.

I have tried to get her counselling help in the past, but she only went to a few sessions.

If I clean now, it would be on my terms, but if I don’t force it now and something comes up with her apartment or health, I would be forced to clean it immediately.

She procrastinates until things become urgent with her; then she makes me deal with this urgency.

I want to honour my mother and also be the responsible daughter. Any advice?

Loving Daughter

Dear Daughter: At the age of 90, your mother is probably not going to make dramatic steps to change. She might not be physically and emotionally able to deal with her hoarding disorder in any truly substantial way. (Hoarding seems to be related to anxiety, and — longer-term — you should ask her primary care physician about appropriate anti-anxiety medication that might help.)

Because you seem to be her primary caretaker, I suggest that you take this on – on your terms.

Ask your sister if she can take your mother on errands/outings for the day. Tell your mom that you and her granddaughter are going to handle this for her, and reassure her that when she returns, her home will be much easier for her to navigate. If your mother isn’t in the space and is instead distracted during the day, she might feel less anxious.

Dear Amy: In the past two years, I have given monetary gifts for graduations, birthdays, a bridal shower and a wedding.

I have not received any acknowledgment or thanks for any of these gifts.

At this point, I would settle for two words in a text message: “thank you.”

Do young people feel so entitled that acknowledging a gift is not necessary?

One of the recipients is now pregnant and her mother-in-law is throwing a baby shower.

Of course, I’ll be invited. I don’t want to go.

Friends have told me that I am being petty. Am I?

Petty in Maryland

Dear Petty: You don’t seem petty, as much as worn out. And I don’t blame you. A natural consequence of this lack of appreciation is that you will be less inspired to keep giving.

My only caution here is that baby showers are intended as celebrations centred on a new baby, who is obviously innocent.

I think it is also time to contact the recipients of these gifts to tell them, “I believe I’ve been generous to you, and I’ve always been happy to celebrate your milestones with gifts. But you have never acknowledged or thanked me for a gift. I’m not sure why this is, but it is quite discouraging.”

Dear Amy: “Tom, in Los Angeles” expressed extreme distress in where this country is headed. I have to say, I was shocked (pleasantly) by your response. Your first line got me: “I think you should celebrate the freedom we each have to either launch an insurrection, or go to the movies.”

Her correspondence to me has since dropped down to nothing, I miss it and feel truly hurt by this. My wife knows nothing of this, and I find that my wife and I have less and less in common anymore.

Should I continue to correspond with her and hope things will go back to normal, or should I just end things altogether and try to move on?

Hurt Online

Dear Hurt: When I comment on the insidious effect (and often damage) that secret “friendships” have on a marriage, people often respond: “But married people can — and should — have friends!”

YES, committed partners can (and should!) conduct their own friendships, but when the friendship is a secret, over time the secrecy amplifies a feeling of intimacy between the friends, leaving the primary partner out.

Your situation is a perfect example of this phenomenon. As your online friendship grew, your in-person relationship shrank. And now – unfortunately, both relationships have dwindled.

Maybe you pursued your online friendship in the first place because you believed that something important was missing in your marriage. But – if you aren’t at least going to try to be a full partner to your spouse, then you should own the consequence.

You should respect your online friend’s choice to maintain some distance from you. You could express concern about her but then you should respect the choices she is making.

Then – you could take the extra relationship energy and recommit to trying to reconnect with your wife. You might start by sending her a warmly written email.

Dear Amy: My granddaughter is barely scraping along. She is divorced from her vindictive and nasty husband. They have three teenagers for whom she is mainly responsible.

She had a good job when she divorced, so the court-ordered child support was low. She has a part-time job now, but with no benefits, and she has had some serious health issues. I help her out by sending her about $1,800 a month.

My husband and I are retired and are comfortably well-off. There is nothing that we need or want that we can’t get for ourselves.

However, our granddaughter sends us gift cards for things that we don’t want or would not get for ourselves.

To me, that is akin to robbing Peter to pay Paul.

The last time she sent me something, I wrote to her and asked her not to send us anything of monetary value. A card or a Zoom call would be more than enough to make us happy.

We are also very old and try to go out as little as possible until there is a vaccine for the virus.

Well, she has just sent my husband a Father’s Day card for $25 to spend at Starbucks. He doesn’t want it.

I have sent it back to her and asked her again not to send us such gifts.

I am sure that I am hurting her feelings and I don’t know what to do about it.

Do you have any suggestions about how better to handle this?

Grands

Dear Grands: You are so generous – and your granddaughter obviously appreciates it very much. She is trying, in her way, to thank you and reciprocate.

I realize this is frustrating for you, but after your second admonition and correction, I think it’s time to let it go. You might be able to re-gift or donate any gift cards to someone who might use them.

Dear Amy: “Too Nice” described being so nice that people always take advantage of her.

That used to be me! Thank you for telling her that people will react poorly when she attempts to establish boundaries. This is just their way of struggling to adjust.

Here's the story behind the numbers",'Sharon Kirkey',2020-07-13 16:25:23+00:00,"In late June, doctors at the Toronto General Hospital were still placing near-death people with COVID-19 on ECMO, or extra corporeal membrane oxygen machines, medicine’s most extreme form of life support.

ECMO works by pumping blood outside of the body, oxygenating it and then sending it back in. Calls were still coming in daily from doctors in the Toronto region hurrying to rescue people in “advanced respiratory failure.” Sixty people were transferred to the General; 32 went on ECMO.

“That’s gone away in the last few weeks,” says Dr. Niall Ferguson, head of critical care medicine at Toronto’s University Health Network, who practises at Toronto General. “We’ve seen a dramatic drop off in the number of severe cases in the Toronto region.”

It’s a similar story across the country. As new infections tear across the southern and western United States, setting new daily records for deaths that epidemiologists say were utterly predictable and disastrous, the virus is largely under control in Canada.

Nearly 8,800 lives have been lost, but the daily number of reported case and deaths, the daily numbers of people hospitalized and ICU admissions, have been steadily declining since the peak of the epidemic in April, federal modelling data released this week shows. Transmission rates are tumbling steeply among the oldest, and most vulnerable, with a slower decline among 20- to 39-year-olds. There are hot spots, outbreaks in long-term care homes and among migrant workers, and too many unnerving cases where the source of exposure is a mystery. But otherwise the news is “good,” Canada’s Deputy Chief Public Health Officer Howard Njoo told a media briefing. But relax too much, too soon, he warned, and the epidemic “will most likely rebound with explosive growth as a distinct possibility.”

A second wave is mathematically inevitable, says University of Ottawa epidemiologist Raywat Deonandan. Researchers have only started to get a grip on just how many of us have been exposed, but the majority are still vulnerable. As long as the virus exists in the environment, “it’s going to find purchase and attempt to reassert itself,” Deonandan says. “That’s the way these things work.”

And so comes the quiet anxiety of waiting for the next surge, and wondering, what are our chances of getting seriously sick? How can the SARS-Cov-2 virus cause lethal blood clotting, sudden cardiac collapse or multi-organ failure in some people and not a whisper of a symptom in so many others? How deadly is this really?

It’s too soon to know. The true case fatality rate won’t be known until the end of the pandemic, Deonandan says.

“This infection messes with me,” Toronto infectious disease physician Dr. Jeff Powis tweeted in late June after having called his 700th patient diagnosed with COVID-19. “Those I expect to do worse do well and those without traditional risk factors get admitted to ICU.”

What increases the risk of death and other bad outcomes?

According to a study of more than 17 million people in England published this week in Nature, advanced age, and being male. Diabetes, severe asthma, obesity, chronic heart or liver disease, dementia, reduced kidney function and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or psoriasis — were also associated with a higher risk of death based on an analysis of the anonymized health records of 17,278,392 adults, slightly less than 11,000 of whom died with COVID-19.

Black and South Asian people were nearly two times more likely to suffer a COVID-related death than white people, for reasons that aren’t fully clear. The most socio-economically deprived were 1.8 times more likely to die than the least deprived, and as Powis noted, health inequities means that, like most infectious diseases, COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting the vulnerable — people living in racialized populations and in poverty, in multigenerational families living in cramped housing, and those with low-paying essential-service jobs and no paid sick leave.

In Canada, people over age 60 make up 96 per cent of deaths. While age and underlying health problems have been identified as risk factors, there are other things at play. The only drug that has so far been shown to keep people from dying from COVID-19 is dexamethasone, a steroid that keeps the body’s immune response from going haywire in response to the virus that causes it.

According to preliminary findings published by British researchers in June, the steroid cut deaths in people on ventilators by one-third. “That really points to the fact that it’s our body’s own immune response to the virus that may have a worse effect than the viral infection itself,” says Dr. Mark Downing, an infectious diseases physician at St. Joseph’s Health Centre in Toronto.

Different underlying medical problems might put people at higher risk of a hyper inflammatory immune response, but there’s no test that can predict, “this is someone who is going to have a runaway immune response his body won’t be able to rein in,” he says.

However, more people in Canada are surviving an ICU admission for COVID-19.

In a study of 117 people admitted to one of six ICU’s in Vancouver, 61 per cent survived to be sent home alive at the time study was published. From the original reports out of China, “they were reporting crazy things, like 90 per cent morality for people on ventilators,” Ferguson says. The experience here suggests the prognosis for those who do get critically sick may not be as bleak as the early reports made it out to be. That’s partly because the system was better prepared. Canada’s ICU’s weren’t saturated and stressed to the breaking point. “We were able to rescue patients with ECMO when we needed to,” Ferguson says. Doctors didn’t have to make wrenching decisions over which patients to route to ICU and who to leave behind. Unlike Italy, obstetricians and ear-nose-and-throat specialists weren’t called in to care for the dying in besieged ICUs.

A greater proportion of cases in Canada are now occurring in younger people, and a smaller in older people. “In some ways that’s unsurprising, because many older people know that they are especially vulnerable and so they’re taking extra precautions,” says Irfan Dhalla, a general internist and a vice-president at Unity Health in Toronto. After a disastrous start, we’re now taking greater precautions with seniors living in long-term care and retirement homes.

But it would be a mistake to think young people are invulnerable from COVID-19. They obviously can get sick and die: Hamilton-born, Tony-nominated Broadway star Nick Cordero died last Sunday at the age of 41. He had been hospitalized for three moths and had a leg amputated. “Just because the fatality rate is incredibly high in people who are in their 80s or 90s does not mean the fatality rate is zero in their 40s, 50s and 60s,” Dhalla said.

So what is the true mortality rate? It’s hard to nail down. In March, the World Health Organization pegged the case fatality rate — the fraction of known cases that die — at 3.6 per cent globally. The case fatality rate is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the virus and the number of confirmed cases, not the actual number of cases or infected people that are floating out around there.

A recent paper in the Canadian Medical Association Journal estimates that, if the reporting rate is less than 50 per cent in Canada, the case fatality rate for COVID-19 is likely to be around 1.6 per cent.

Even then a case fatality rate isn’t constant. It varies with how much we test, with the fragility of the population, and the robustness of our health-care system, Deonandan adds.

The true measure of lethality, he says, is the infection fatality rate — of all the people who get it, whether or not they show symptoms or are even tested, how many will die?

Nature reports that a growing number of studies from different regions is pegging the infection fatality rate at between 0.5 and one per cent, meaning five to 10 people will die for every 1,000 infected.

For seasonal flu, it’s 0.1 to 0.2. Not only is COVID deadlier, it’s profoundly more infectious. More people are going to get it. And although some doctors are reporting that the nose swabs being taken now are different from the swabs at the beginning of the pandemic — there seems to be less viral load — to Deonandan that just means we’re testing fewer symptomatic people. Lower the thresholds for who gets tested, and you’re going to get people who are less sick.

“That should not be confused with having a less severe disease present in the community,” Deonandan says.

A pandemic has a way of revealing the nature of a society, he says. “It either exacerbates the disparities or it highlights the strengths.” Canadians, more so than our neighbours to the south, “have embraced this ethic of communal responsibility,” says Deonandan. “For the most part, people are onboard with protecting other people, with wearing masks, with doing what’s right for the community. That’s not a message you see coming out of the USA.”

Other positive signs: Transmission by fomites (contaminated surfaces and objects) doesn’t seem to be as serious as once thought.

According to a commentary published last week in the Lancet, most studies used large amounts of virus, higher than what would happen under real-life scenarios. “In my opinion, the chance of transmission through inanimate surfaces is very small, and only in instances where an infected person coughs or sneezes on the surface and someone else touches that surface soon after the cough or sneeze,” within one to two hours, writes Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology, biochemistry and molecular genetics at Rutgers University.

Cleaning surfaces is still important, Deonandan says, but perhaps we don’t have to be obsessed with it. The WHO this week acknowledged airborne transmission is a thing, but it’ s not the primary way people get COVID-19. It’s by droplets, and masks diminish droplet transmission, Deonadan says. “It tells me we have the tools to contain this well.”

Dhalla believes so, too. “The overall story I see is that Canada has the resources and expertise to both contain COVID-19 and re-open schools and workplaces at the same time.” That’s provided we keep outbreaks from spinning out of control with well-resourced strategies to test, trace, isolate, support and mask, and hotel rooms for the homeless, or somewhere they could be supported and physically distanced.

Still, it bothers him when people want him to say that COVID-19 isn’t that serious. “I have a hard time with numbers, everybody has a hard time with numbers. It’s hard to get your head around concepts like 0.5 per cent or exponential growth at 1.1 — what do these things mean?

“Ninety-nine-point-five per cent sounds pretty safe. But really, would you take a one-in-200 chance of dying? I woudn’t. It’s very clear now, four months into the pandemic, that this is a serous illness that has resulted in great loss of life.",[],1800,0.8467411468487882

Avoid frailty,'Dr. John Muscedere',2020-07-13 12:03:29+00:00,"The global pandemic has struck a death blow across our senior population. Canada has had almost 9,000 deaths from COVID-19 so far, with the vast majority (97 per cent) occurring in those over age 60.

Canada also holds the unenviable record among developed nations for the highest percentage of COVID-19 deaths occurring in long-term care facilities: 81 per cent compared to just 28 per cent in Australia or 31 per cent in the United States, for example.

Many who died from COVID-19 were living with frailty.

Frailty is a state of vulnerability when an individual is more susceptible to major and minor health events, including infections, illness and chronic disease, and may experience a decline across many body systems.

Frailty directly affects quality and quantity of life and can be used as a measure to predict functional impairment, falls, loneliness, depression, institutionalization and death.

Over one and a half million Canadians are estimated to live with frailty — affecting another 3.75 million Canadians who act as family caregivers. The prevalence of frailty in Indigenous populations is double the national average, where 50 per cent of those over age 65 are living with frailty.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the pitfalls of how we approach ageing in our society. Currently we use a reactive, problem-based approach to ageing instead of a preventive, holistic approach.

Preventing or delaying frailty won’t prevent COVID-19, but it will help make Canadian seniors more resilient generally, it will add quality of life to remaining years, and reduce the stress on our health and social services and on family caregivers. And it will help us prepare for the next pandemic and/or looming social care crisis.

So, what can be done?

At the individual level, we can AVOID frailty by:

• Activity: Regular exercise, particularly strength training, balancing exercises and activities that get your heart rate up daily.

• Vaccination: Keep your vaccinations and boosters up to date, including for flu, shingles and pneumonia.

• Optimizing medication: Have your health provider review your medications annually, including prescriptions and over-the-counter drugs, vitamins and supplements so you are only taking essential medications.

• Interacting: Social isolation can lead to frailty and advanced aging, is linked to high blood pressure, depression and dementia.

• Diet and nutrition: As we age, we need more vitamin D, calcium and protein found in meat, fish, eggs and beans to keep our muscles and bones strong.

We also need governments to create programs and policies that promote an active and healthy lifestyle.

Governments at all levels need to fund programs that promote independence and physical function, focused on daily living activities that would allow seniors to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. Nursing homes should be the last option, not the only option, for seniors that need assistance with daily living.

Governments also need to combat social isolation and fund programs to reduce social vulnerability in seniors, including innovative online programming during the pandemic.

We also need governments to support policies to encourage healthy food options and better nutrition for seniors, with specific attention to the needs of older adults living with frailty, including establishing nutrition standards for care facilities, acute care and programs like Meals on Wheels.

Importantly, governments need to address poverty amongst seniors by funding and implementing a national pharmacare program, a housing strategy specific to seniors and providing adequate income supports for seniors to enable financial security and healthy retirement.

Finally, together, we need to combat ageism. It is not acceptable that so many of our older adults have died during COVID-19. They are not expendable. Older adults can have quality lives if we give them the safeguards and the supports they need — to live through the pandemic and well beyond it.

The 179 postings on international job board medical.careers.global include ads for everything from generational practitioners in Crowsnest Pass, Alta., to spine surgeons in Edmonton. The surge of new postings, which multiple Alberta physicians described as highly unusual, came over the past two weeks as tensions between the province and doctors continue to escalate over a months-long row that began when the government terminated its master agreement with physicians and imposed changes to their pay formula.

Earlier this week, the Alberta Medical Association released a survey of its members revealing that 42 per cent were considering leaving the province due to the dispute with the government. Edmonton-based psychiatrist Dr. Christine Froelich said the job postings are akin to the government bringing in scab workers. Rather than convince the doctors who are looking to leave, or have already left, to stay, it’s attempting to replace them with international doctors who aren’t familiar with the challenges their colleagues are facing.

“That’s exactly what it is,” Froelich said about scab work. “We’re doctors and we don’t have a union but that’s as close as it gets to that. They want replacement workers. It’s ‘if you don’t agree with us, this worker will replace you.’ ”

Dr. Jillian Ratti, who specializes in family medicine in Calgary, made similar comments on Twitter in a series of posts about the job postings. She accused the Alberta Health Services and Health Minister Tyler Shandro of “searching abroad for unknowing-scabs to replace the docs who poured their hearts and souls into their communities.”

We’re doctors and we don’t have a union but that’s as close as it gets to that

In a statement emailed to the National Post, a spokesperson for Alberta Health Services, which is responsible for job searches and hiring, said the province has “long relied on many foreign-trained physicians to provide care in many areas across the province.” The positions, she said, are also listed on Alberta Health Services’ website and are often reposted on local and national job boards as well.

Dr. Ed Aasman, president of rural medicine with the Alberta Medical Association, doesn’t believe there’s an agenda behind the postings made for positions in rural communities, at least. “They’re legitimate,” he said, and correspond to long-term needs that those communities have.

Aasman couldn’t speak to the volume of postings and how that’s compared to past hiring surges. Froelich, however, said the number of job postings was unusual.

While there are dozens of rural postings, more than 50 of the new positions are Edmonton based while nearly an additional 30 are split between Lethbridge, Alta., and Calgary.

The rural positions don’t set off any red flags for Aasman. That would change, for example, if the international doctors brought in no longer had to do the customary three to six months of training under another physician in Alberta before starting the jobs they were brought in for. Another red flag, Aasman said, is if the positions came with lower salaries than those offered to doctors who are currently working in the province.

Although Aasman hasn’t seen any doctors leave the province yet — that might take some time, he admits, because of the complications of moving during a global pandemic — he has already seen the effects of the confrontation between the United Conservative Party and the province’s doctors. Aasman knows of three doctors working in rural communities who retired early because of the changes made by the government.

NDP MLA and health critic David Shepherd is also concerned about physicians in rural communities leaving for greener pastures. The job postings, he said, make it clear that there isn’t sufficient back-up to cover a potential exodus. Incoming international doctors may also not fully understand the situation they’re stepping into, he said.

Shepherd also shares the concerns of some doctors, such as Froelich and Ratti, that the UCP is edging closer to privatizing health care.

Bill 30, the Health Statutes Amendment Act, which the UCP introduced last week, gave corporations the ability to bill the government as if they were physicians, Shepherd said.

“This is the first step to breaking down the legal barriers to prevent full privatization of health care in Alberta,” Shepherd said. “We’re beyond this being a question of incompetence. This is no longer a mistake.

“This shows the incredible damage (the UCP) has done in only a few short months with health care and doctors in the midst of a global pandemic.”",[],761,0.964812323837198

But a new Statistics Canada survey reveals that only 52 per cent of Quebecers say they would wear a mask in public when physical distancing is difficult, compared to 78 per cent of people living in Ontario.

Four months after the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown, why do so many Quebecers still refuse to wear a mask when they leave the house?

“I think there are some obvious reasons,” said McGill psychology professor Ross Otto. “It’s uncomfortable and it looks weird, but I believe social pressure could work. I think once we hit a point where enough people are doing it, it will start to feel funny not wearing one.”

See More +

Another factor, according to Otto, may be the lack of tangible cause and effect to wearing a mask.

“The psychology of it is interesting,” he said. “If you put on sunscreen, or if you don’t, within a couple of hours you will have either avoided getting burned or gotten burned. Masks are not really to protect yourself, but to protect others, so you wouldn’t see the effects of wearing one versus not wearing one. It’s too diffuse, abstract and slow.”

Ultimately, Otto muses, Quebecers’ resistance might come down to our long-standing status as a distinct society, and how that affects people’s feelings about following the crowd.

“I’m not from here,” he noted, “but I would say that outside Quebec, there’s a stronger adherence to rules and community norms.”

Dr. Nima Machouf was part of a group of health-care professionals that in June called on the province to make masks mandatory in closed public spaces as well as open areas where physical distancing is difficult. Yet the epidemiologist doesn’t believe Quebecers have an inherent problem wearing masks.

“For anything, people resist measures,” she said, “but when there’s a measure and they have to, people do it. I don’t like seatbelts, but I wear one; before, people didn’t because it wasn’t against the law. If there’s no rule, people think it’s not necessary.”

Machouf has seen encouraging changes in Quebecers’ attitudes regarding masks over the past few months.

“Now you see a lot of people wearing them,” she said. “In stores and other closed areas, maybe half of people are doing it. Now that people will be obliged to wear them, everyone will be protected.”

Her only complaint is that the new regulations could have come sooner.

“I find it late,” Machouf said. “If they had imposed masks earlier, it could have shortened the confinement period. Now, with deconfinement, masks are even more important, to avoid a second wave.”

McGill law professor Daniel Weinstock also thinks the Quebec government has a share of the blame in Quebecers’ slow adoption of masks.

“At the beginning of the pandemic, Dr. Arruda was quite adamant, saying there was no need to wear a mask if you didn’t have symptoms,” Weinstock said. “For weeks and weeks, it was repeated. It’s hard to undo that messaging overnight.”

Weinstock also wondered if an ongoing political discourse of a different kind in the province may be having a subconscious effect on people’s aversion to wearing masks.

“This is purely speculative, and would need empirical research,” he said, “but Quebec has spent the last (several) years with three different governments — the Liberals, the PQ and the CAQ — talking about the value of giving and receiving services with an uncovered face.

“This was obviously in a very specific context, (but) is that playing into this?”

Whatever the reasoning, Weinstock thinks the new regulations are a good thing, and that Quebecers will come around to wearing masks.

“It is, after all, just a thing over your face,” he said. “If the benefits are as great as a lot of epidemiologists say it is … it seems like a no-brainer.”

First, Paul Tagliabue, who ran the NFL for 17 years, was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s Class of 2020 in Canton, Ohio. It took 10 years and a one-time only expanded class for the NFL’s 100th-year celebration to get across the goaline. Tim Finchem didn’t have to sweat out “golf’s highest honor.” He was a first-ballot guy as a finalist, just like his fellow Class of 2021 inductee, Tiger Woods.

“To be included in that group is very powerful,” Finchem said in a press conference on Monday of being elected in the “contributor category” to join the World Golf Hall of Fame in St. Augustine, Florida. “I want to certainly thank those that thought that I was deserving of it. I kind of in many ways don’t feel like I am deserving because I just had so much fun being in the job for so long. It was absolutely captivating for me year after year after year.”

Finchem isn’t the only one who doesn’t think he’s deserving. Social media was not kind when the announcement was made this morning.

it’s ridiculous. he happened to be sitting there when Tiger arrived and just got swept up in the hurricane. A rubber tree plant could’ve done that. — Rick Reilly (@ReillyRick) April 20, 2020

And why should they be? Just days ago, my colleague Beth Ann Nichols and others applauded the World Golf Hall of Fame for finally electing Marion Hollins also through the contributor category. (Quick aside: If the Hall is going to continue with this category, please at least limit it to a max of one per induction.) Hollins was a trailblazer and while her inclusion won’t send people turning off I-95 at International Golf Parkway in droves, hopefully some of those visitors who spring for a ticket to go and see the locker for Tiger Woods will learn her story too.

But the World Golf Hall of Fame needed another plaque of an administrator about as much as it needed one for Augusta National chairman Billy Payne two years ago. This isn’t so much a knock on Finchem as much as a wider complaint that we’re honoring the wrong people. The Hall of Fame should be for the greats of the game, the players who achieved the moments etched in our memory. There is still one more inductee to be named later this week, but all of the other players who will be left on the outside looking in are far more deserving of recognition in the Hall of Fame than Finchem.

He led the PGA Tour through very prosperous times during his 22-year tenure that began in 1994 after Deane Beman passed him the baton, but Finchem’s been richly rewarded for it. According to the Tour’s 2017 Form 990, he earned $12 million and another $6 million in reportable compensation from related organizations.

“Deane’s left him a Mercedes with the tank a quarter full, and all Tim has to do is keep putting gas in it,” Tour pro Peter Jacobsen once said.

That is an oversimplification, of course, but best I can tell Finchem wisely followed the Deane Beman playbook and had the good fortune of having Tiger, the world’s most famous athlete, come along and lift the sport to new heights during his tenure. As Beman used to say during his good years, “we’re not selling here, we’re enrolling.” (Last side note: Beman, Michael Bonallack of the R&A, and former USGA president Bill Campbell, who are all previously inducted, could have earned this distinction for their amateur record alone.) I’m not saying Finchem had an easy job, but it would have been hard to fail at the job with Tiger and an ever-expanding TV contract.

Even Finchem conceded as much when he told the following story about Tiger.

“There was some magazine that ranked me in the top 10 or 20 powerful people in sports one year. Obviously a lousy magazine. But people called me to say, what do you think?” Finchem recounted. “Well, I’m not — you know, the person that’s the most powerful person in sports is Tiger Woods, and they said, what do you mean by that. I said, well, I’ll give you an example. If I wanted to convey something, we’re building a tournament in Tokyo or something, I wanted to convey some information, I’d have to spend a week getting people charged up figuring out some communications, who are the people we have to go to to get this message across, this, that and the other. Tiger Woods doesn’t have to do any of that. Tiger Woods, all he has to do is issue a little statement, and his name is on it, Tiger Woods, everybody in the world knows about it. And to me, that’s real power. That is real power.”

And when asked about how much more difficult a job it would have been without Tiger, Finchem channeled his inner Captain Obvious and said, “It would have been a much more difficult job.”

You don’t say? Give Finchem a gold watch on the way out the door for a job well done and I’m OK if you want to let him continue as a board member of The First Tee. But membership in the World Golf Hall of Fame should be sacred. His election further validates claims that it is merely a popularity contest and charges of cronyism. (PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan, who was Finchem’s handpicked successor, and other leaders in the game whose chances of being honored in the future probably also improved with Finchem’s election are among the voters. It all adds up to too much potential conflict of interest.) Interestingly, Finchem was a semi-finalist in 2019 and didn’t even make it to the list of finalists. It makes you wonder what changed in the last two years during his retirement. But his election is just another reason why the number of members returning for the ceremony is often low and why Hall of Famers continue to give their best mementos elsewhere. The last thing it needed was to enshrine another administrator, even if Finchem says he has a great letter from Arnold Palmer that he will donate to his exhibit along with some photographs of the greats that he bumped elbows with – from Gene Sarazen to Tiger.

When asked if he felt administrators should be honored at the Hall of Fame, Finchem demurred. “I’m not going to comment on that now, but when I speak at the induction, I will comment on it. I’m not trying to be cagey, but I’d just prefer to do it that way.”

I’ll save his speech writer some time. He’s going to say that it’s an honor to be recognized but the players are the real heroes and that he and his fellow administrators just support them. And people will clap politely and then we’ll move on to the induction of Tiger and the next time some guest says they want to see Finchem’s plaque will be the first time, but he’ll be housed there all the same between Nick Faldo and Raymond Floyd.

But as long as the Finchem’s of the industry continue to be enshrined, “golf’s highest honor” will remain just what it is – another empty slogan.",[],1244,0.9667570821420678

That much was evident with the news that former PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem will join Tiger Woods and Marion Hollins in the next class to be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. The announcement was greeted with griping that was as predictable as it is tedious, an exercise in collective eye-rolling intended to suggest not only that Finchem is undeserving but that his inclusion dilutes the Hall’s credibility.

That argument is familiar and has been leveled against more deserving targets who got a call to the Hall, like George H.W. Bush, Bing Crosby or Bob Hope. But there’s no sound basis for raising it against Finchem.

There is a sentiment that says lockers in St. Augustine ought to be earned for exploits on the field of play, and the only field of play that matters is a golf course. Not a boardroom or a factory or a production trailer or a media center. It’s an absolutist position that would disqualify plenty of current Hall of Famers.

Like C.B. Macdonald or Pete Dye, who only designed those fields of play,

Like Karsten Solheim, who innovated the instruments used on those fields.

Like Dan Jenkins or Herb Graffis, whose only mastery was of a typewriter on the sidelines.

The reality is that most sports halls of fame are intended to acknowledge not just quantifiable achievement but immeasurable impact. Charlie Sifford wasn’t inducted for his two PGA Tour victories but for what his presence, courage and determination symbolized in golf’s ugliest era. Frank Chirkinian wasn’t given a locker to store his Emmy awards, but because the legendary CBS producer’s influence far exceeded that of most players he put on living room TVs.

It’s why the football and tennis Halls have “contributor” categories to enshrine non-players, and it’s why the golf Hall is welcoming Finchem, just as it did his predecessor Deane Beman, Augusta National’s Billy Payne and the European Tour’s Ken Schofield before him.

This is hardly to say Finchem is beyond criticism. He forged a colorless culture at Tour HQ and enforced a level of secrecy around disciplinary proceedings and drug testing that would have been envied in Pyongyang. But it can’t be argued that he didn’t leave the Tour in a considerably better place than he found it.

When he took over as commissioner in 1994, total prize money on Tour was $56.4 million. Toss in the Champions and then-Web.com Tours and the fund was just over $90 million. This season the Tour’s prize money is nearing $400 million, before bonuses at least until COVID-19 upended things. He created the oft-maligned World Golf Championship events, which if nothing else helped temper Greg Norman’s plans for world domination, and the FedEx Cup playoff system 13 years ago.

It’s a popular though specious suggestion that Finchem owes his success to coat-tailing on Tiger Woods. Sure, he was dealt a strong hand, but he played it well for what was demanded of him. If subsisting on crumbs from Tiger’s table was sufficient to earn a spot in the Hall, then Mark Steinberg would have his own wing.

Arguing over Hall of Fame inductees is a staple of most every sport, moreso during a quarantine when we’re happy for any meat to chew on, no matter how lacking in nutrition it is. And golf’s Hall has richly deserved much of the criticism it has received over the years. The last class inducted Peggy Kirk Bell. The famed teacher was eminently worthy, but she was deserving of the honor when she was alive. She lived for 95 years, but the Hall only saw fit to induct her three years after her death. That kind of standard can’t be encouraging to others who deserve a spot and have been thus far denied, like Tom Weiskopf or Butch Harmon.

There are obvious shortcomings surrounding golf’s Hall of Fame. There are those who deserve the honor who have been overlooked and those who’ve been given a spot they didn’t merit. But whatever his failings, Tim Finchem doesn’t belong on either list.",[],704,0.9716844006710698

That triggered a Special Weather Statement from Environment Canada, warning of heavy rains and the possibility of flooding.

The advisory was soon upgraded to a Severe Thunderstorm Warning, as the storm unleashed torrents of rain, strong winds and frequent lighting.

As the storm neared Lake Ontario, localized rotation prompted Environment Canada to also issue a Tornado Watch, which was rescinded about 10 minutes later as the rotation weakened.

Wind gusts approaching 100 km/h were possible along the storm’s western fringes, Environment Canada said.

Videos and images shared to social media showed flooded streets and parking garages, trees knocked down and downpours reducing visibility to near zero.

As of 4 p.m., sporadic power outages were spread across the city’s western regions, according to Toronto Hydro.

“Crews are making progress with restoring power across the city,” Toronto Hydro tweeted at around 6 p.m. “Crews are focused on safety emergencies first including downed wires and trees on wires.”

And boy is it ever going to pour in Toronto this weekend.

A major rain storm on “steroids” will start overnight Friday and could leave up to 50 mm of the wet stuff by the time it’s all over Sunday night.

“A real whopper of a system,” Environment Canada’s senior climatologist David Phillips said Friday, describing the storm as “a significant event.”

“Every single conceivable weather warning and condition is part of this massive system. It’s a powerful storehouse of weather even for January,” he said. ” It’s got subtropical moisture from the gulf of Mexico just loaded with moisture and it is coming northward.”

“The question (for Toronto) is when will it turn to freezing rain? And most of the indications right now are that it will be the evening on Saturday,” Phillips added.

Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for Toronto calling it “a soaker” with “very strong southwest winds Sunday.”

The temperature, meanwhile, is expected to get up to a balmy 11C on Saturday (the record high for Jan. 11 of 11. 7C was set in 1975) before plunging to a high of 2C (still above normal) on Sunday.

The rain is expected to be continuous and heavy at times all day Saturday and into Sunday morning.

“The average we get of rain in Toronto in January would be around 25 mm,” said Phillips. “So what we’re going to get in one day, in one 24-hour period, is going to exceed what we normally get in 31 days.”

Strong southwest winds are also expected Sunday morning, especially along the Lake Ontario shoreline, with gusts up to 90 km/h.

The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) also issued a statement Thursday saying “a flood outlook” was in effect until Sunday and “all shorelines, rivers and streams within the GTA should be considered hazardous,” and “any children or pets should be kept away from any slippery or unstable banks.”

Meanwhile, the City of Toronto sent out a press release Friday saying “Toronto Water’s storm readiness plan is in place,” and crews are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to answer flooding calls at 311.

Otherwise, residents are being asked to clear catch basins on their streets to avoid potential street and basement flooding and “move valuables from basement to shelves or upper floors, and take cleaners, paint or chemicals off the floor as not to further contaminate potential floodwater.”

They’re also being told to keep eavestroughs and downspouts clear and shovel any snow or ice away from their foundation and onto their lawn not the road.

""I can't say no to a good time,"" said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. ""I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.""

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

""Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,"" he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

""You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,"" said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

""The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,"" Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when -- not if -- his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

""We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,"" said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

""It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,"" Merhej explained.

""I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.""

The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld City's appeal against the UEFA ban, but imposed a 10 million euro ($11.3 million) fine on the club for failing to co-operate with independent investigators.

Some UEFA allegations accusing City of finance rules violations dating back several years were not proven and others were “time-barred,” the court said.

CAS plans to publish a detailed written verdict within days. That could help explain why UEFA's case did not comply with its own internal rules, and show how other evidence was weighed.

Man City joins Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and Galatasaray in beating UEFA in appeal cases related to finance monitoring rules in the past two years.

The decision by the three CAS judges clears the team coached by Pep Guardiola to play in the group stage of the Champions League next season. The case does not affect City's place in this season's competition, which resumes next month.

City's win guarantees tens of millions of dollars in UEFA prize money next season. It also protects against players leaving to seek Champions League action with another club.

Guardiola had pledged to stay in Manchester “no matter what happens” in the courts.

“The club welcomes the implications of today's ruling as a validation of the club's position and the body of evidence that it was able to present,” City said in a statement.

UEFA punished Man City in February for “serious breaches” of finance monitoring rules and failing to co-operate with investigators. The allegations included that City, owned by Abu Dhabi's royal family, misled UEFA over several years to meet financial integrity rules - known as Financial Fair Play - required to enter European club competitions.

City denied wrongdoing, and said it had “irrefutable evidence” the claims were not true.

“The CAS award emphasized that most of the alleged breaches reported by the Adjudicatory Chamber of the (UEFA club finance panel) were either not established or time-barred,” the court said.

City's win will raise doubts about the future of the UEFA Financial Fair Play program, created in 2009 after the global financial crisis.

The system was used to ban several clubs, including Galatasaray in 2016, from one season of UEFA competitions. City was the first club to be banned for two years.

In a statement, UEFA pointed blame at its own club finance investigators and judges for “insufficient conclusive evidence to uphold all of the (panel's) conclusions” and not meeting a five-year statute of limitations.

UEFA could choose to challenge the CAS ruling at Switzerland's supreme court. Federal appeals in CAS cases rarely succeed and only consider narrow grounds of legal procedure.

The urgent ruling came one month after a three-day hearing held by video link between Switzerland and England. A full verdict detailing the evidence, expert witness testimony and the judges' reasons is due within days.

UEFA-appointed investigators opened a case after leaked club emails and documents from City officials were published by German magazine Der Spiegel in November 2018. They were likely obtained by a hacker from Portugal.

The published evidence appeared to show City deceived UEFA by overstating sponsorship deals from 2012-16 and hid the source of revenue linked to state-backed companies in Abu Dhabi.

City never disputed the documents were authentic, but argued the evidence was stolen and reported out of context. It was unclear Monday what part the leaked documents ultimately played in the case.

UEFA had previously signed off on City's submitted accounts since 2014. That year, UEFA fined City 20 million euros ($22.6 million) of its Champions League prize money in a first wave of assessments of European clubs' finances. French champion PSG got the same fine in a similar case.

UEFA decided to create the FFP system 11 years ago to stabilize the soccer economy by monitoring finances of 200-plus clubs which qualify each year for its competitions. Clubs must approach break-even on commercial income and spending on transfers and salaries. Sponsor deals linked to wealthy owners must be set at fair market rates.

Critics of FFP argue it protects storied clubs with a huge fan base from being challenged by ambitious rivals with state support, like Man City and Qatar-owned PSG.

UEFA said Monday it and the European Club Association “remain committed to its principles.”

The UEFA rules will be challenged again at CAS this week. Turkish title contender Trabzonspor is appealing against a one-year ban for failing to abide by an earlier settlement deal.

The fine to be paid to UEFA will benefit other clubs, including City rivals Liverpool and Manchester United. UEFA rules require that Financial Fair Play fines - in most cases, prize money deductions - must be redistributed among other clubs who play in the Champions League or Europa League that season.",[],783,0.9542661604309051

Westbrook made the revelation on social media. As recently as Sunday, the Rockets believed that Westbrook and James Harden - neither of whom travelled with the team to Walt Disney World near Orlando last week - would be with the team in the next few days.

In Westbrook's case, that now seems most unlikely.

“I tested positive for covid-19 prior to my teams departure to Orlando,” Westbrook wrote on his Instagram page. “I'm currently feeling well, quarantined, and looking forward to rejoining my teammates when I am cleared.”

Westbrook is averaging 27.5 points, eight rebounds and seven assists per game for the Rockets this season. Houston has clinched a playoff spot and resumes its season with the first of eight seeding games on July 31 against Dallas.

Westbrook also offered a word of caution in his post.

“Thank you for all the well wishes and continued support,” he wrote. “Please take this virus seriously. Be safe. Mask up!”

Westbrook's announcement came on another day where case numbers in Florida and Texas - two of the nation's coronavirus hotspots - keep rising to levels that have officials and residents deeply concerned.

At the NBA bubble, however, optimism that the rules established by the league and the players will work - even though some Disney parks reopened to visitors over the weekend and the MLS restart, also at the campus, has seen two teams leave after a spate of positive tests.

“Our protocols are unbelievable,” Toronto Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said Monday. “I think our protocols and our health and safety measures have been top-notch. I think this thing will work perfectly. ... We're doing everything that we can possibly do to make sure that we're healthy, we're safe and we're in an environment where we can be successful and do our jobs at a high level.”

A new name must still be selected for one of the oldest and most storied teams in the National Football League, and it was unclear how soon that will happen. But for now, arguably the most polarizing name in North American professional sports is gone at a time of reckoning over racial injustice, iconography and racism in the U.S.

The move came less than two weeks after owner Dan Snyder, a boyhood fan of the team who once declared he would never get rid of the name, launched a “thorough review” amid pressure from sponsors. FedEx, Nike, Pepsi and Bank of America all lined up against the name, which was given to the franchise in 1933 when the team was still based in Boston.

“The NFL and Dan Snyder, we have to commend them on making the right call to change the name,” said Oneida Indian Nation Representative Ray Halbritter, leader of the “Change the Mascot” campaign. “Dan Snyder won today because now he has a legacy that will be different from the racial slur that was the team name. I know that's not an easy thing to do, but it was the right thing to do.”

The team said it is “retiring” the name and logo and that Snyder and coach Ron Rivera are working closely to develop a new moniker and design. The announcement came on the old letterhead with the Redskins name because the team technically retains it until a new one is chosen and approved.

Native American advocates and experts have long criticized the name they call a “dictionary-defined racial slur.” Over a dozen Native leaders and organizations wrote to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last week demanding an immediate end to Washington's use of the name. Goodell, who has fielded questions on the topic for years, said he supported the review.

Protests against the name predate Snyder buying the team in 1999, and, until now, he had shown no willingness to consider a change. Strong words from sponsors - including a company run by a minority stakeholder of the team - changed the equation.

FedEx earlier this month became the first sponsor to announce it had asked the organization to change the name, particularly important because CEO Frederick Smith owns part of the team. FedEx paid $205 million for the long-term naming rights to the team's stadium in Landover, Maryland.

The lease at FedEx Field expires in 2027, and dropping the name keeps open various possibilities in Maryland, Virginia and Washington for the team's new stadium and headquarters. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser has said the name was an “obstacle” to Snyder building on the old RFK Stadium site, which is believed to be his preference.

The team recently started cutting ties with racist founder George Preston Marshall, removing his name from the Ring of Fame and renaming the lower bowl at FedEx Field for the team's first Black player, late Hall of Famer Bobby Mitchell. Marshall, who renamed the Boston Braves the Redskins in 1933 and moved the team to D.C. four years later, was a segregationist and the last NFL owner to integrate his team. The current logo shows the profile of a red-faced Native American with feathers in his hair.

Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves and the National Hockey League's Chicago Blackhawks have said they have no inclination to change their names. Some advocates would like to see all Native American names, mascots and imagery out of sports.

“Our fight continues,” Crystal Echo Hawk of the Native American advocacy group IllumiNative said in a statement. “We will not rest until the offensive use of Native imagery, logos and names are eradicated from professional, collegiate and (other school) sports. The time is now to stand in solidarity and declare that racism will not be tolerated.”

Halbritter said it was important to note those other names are not a slur, but he hopes a “broader discussion” can be had. He pointed out that Florida State spoke with the Seminole tribe about its name, the same thing a minor league baseball team in Spokane, Washington, did with local Native Americans.

It was not immediately clear if the organization is consulting Native Americans on a new name or if any imagery will even be used.

“I think it's striking that the NFL and other owners of other sports teams don't have a conversation with Native America on these names,” Halbritter said. “It's about respect, and I don't understand why they just don't have a conversation with the affected people.”

Long removed from the glory days of winning Super Bowl titles in the 1982, 1987 and 1991 seasons under coach Joe Gibbs, Washington's NFL team has just five playoff appearances in 21 years and no postseason victories since 2005. The team has lacked a nationally marketable player since Robert Griffin III's short-lived stardom, and the 2020 schedule features zero prime-time games for a franchise that used to be a draw.

Re-branding with a new name and logo - and perhaps the same burgundy and gold colours - coupled with turning football operations over to Rivera could be a boon for Snyder on and off the field. Even if a segment of the fan base opposes the change in the name of tradition, winning would more than make up for those losses.",[],903,0.9432772010759508

He couldn't have imagined all the fun was just starting.

Still three shots behind Justin Thomas with three holes to play, Morikawa made only one birdie and it was enough for a 6-under 66 to force a playoff.

The three times he played the 18th hole, he twice could only watch as Thomas had 10-foot putts for the win.

The other time, Morikawa had to make a 25-foot putt to keep playing.

The only dull moment Sunday at the Workday Charity Open was the end, when Morikawa took two putts for par from just inside 10 feet to beat Thomas on the third playoff hole and win for the second time in his career.

""Amazing,"" Morikawa said when asked how he would sum up the day to someone who only saw the result.

That covered a lot of territory.

Morikawa never looked like the winner until it was over.

Thomas had 10 straight one-putt greens, the last one a 25-foot eagle putt on the par-5 15th for the three-shot lead with three holes to play. And while he made two bogeys for a 69 that allowed for a playoff, he had reason to think it was over when he made a 50-foot birdie putt from the back of the 18th green.

""I never assumed it was over,"" Thomas said. ""Percentages would say that it heavily is close to being that way. ... I just tried to keep my head down and think he's going to make it, but hoping he's not, selfishly, but he did.""

Roger Sloan of Merritt, B.C., was the top Canadian, finishing in a tie for 27th at 7 under, 12 off the pace. Adam Hadwin of Abbotsford, B.C., tied for 35th at 5 under, Corey Conners of Listowel, Ont., tied for 39th at 4 under, and Abbotsford's Nick Taylor and Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., tied for 48th at 3 under.

Thomas missed a 10-footer for par in regulation, and a putt close to that same line for birdie on the second extra hole. He was done in by a tee shot on No. 10 that wound up in the rough behind a tree, forcing him to pitch out 102 yards short of the green. He missed his 15-foot par putt, leading to Morikawa's two-putt par and the win.

It was a wild ride for Thomas, too. He started with a two-shot lead, trailed by three after just five holes, made four straight birdies and was ahead by three shots 10 holes later, and ultimately lost in a playoff.

""It's completely unacceptable to give up a three-shot lead with three to go,"" Thomas said. ""I'm upset, I'm disappointed in myself. But at the end of the day it's over with now, and I just need to take some time this afternoon and tonight to build on it and figure out what I can do better going into next week.""

They return in four days for the Memorial on a Muirfield Village course expected to be as fast as a U.S. Open.

This was a big win for the 23-year-old Morikawa, who in his 13 months since graduating from Cal already has established a reputation for a high level of consistency. His only victory was at an opposite-field event last summer. He beat a field at the Workday Charity Open that featured five of the top 10 in the world.

""This is a huge kind of stepping stone,"" said Morikawa, who goes to No. 13 in the world, one spot ahead of Tiger Woods. ""We got No. 1 out of the way. We got No. 2. Let the gates just open and let's keep going.""

It was his second playoff since the PGA Tour returned June 11 from the COVID-19 pandemic. Morikawa lost on the first extra hole at Colonial by missing a 3-foot putt. He had a 2-foot putt in regulation on Sunday that caught the left edge of the cup and swirled in. ""My heartbeat must have skipped a billion times,"" he said.

The only thing missing was a handshake from Jack Nicklaus. He'll be there next week for the Memorial, as the PGA Tour stays at Muirfield Village.

Viktor Hovland of Norway had a 71 and finished alone in third. He was in the final group of three young stars, all of whom had the lead at some point during the final round.

Hovland's hopes ended with two shots -- finding a bunker from the 10th fairway for bogey, and a driver on the reachable 14 that only missed by about 5 feet, enough to slowly tumble down the bank and into the water.

Morikawa also hit driver on the 14th that rolled 12 feet away. He narrowly missed the eagle putt, while Thomas hit a splendid wedge with side spin to 3 feet for birdie to stay one ahead. That's when it appeared the tournament turned in Thomas' favour.

Morikawa was in thick rough right of the fairway on the par-5 15th, unsure he could get over the slope to the next section of fairway. It came out heavy, just through the fairway into light rough 190 yards away. By then, Thomas hit 3-wood to 25 feet. Morikawa went through a bunker to the steep slope by the green, and did well to chop that chip high in the air to 5 feet. Thomas made his eagle putt. Morikawa made his par to stay alive.

""A three-shot cushion with three to go is a lot different than four with three to go,"" Morikawa said. ""And then him hitting somewhat of a poor tee shot on 16, I knew this was my window of opportunity.""

Thomas missed a 10-foot par putt. Morikawa caught a good bounce with an ordinary 8-iron to the 17th and made a 10-foot birdie. Thomas found the fairway bunker off the tee at the 18th, played short of the green and couldn't make his par.

The starting times were moved up to avoid a forecast of thunderstorms, so the final round was broadcast on a delay, available live only on streaming.

With no fans on the course, it was the wildest finish that hardly anyone saw.",[],1024,0.9778318522712417

""My 'exercise' is playing, almost never during the week, a quick round of golf. Obama played more and much longer rounds, no problem,"" Trump tweeted.

CNN has previously fact-checked Trump's claim that he has played less golf than his predecessor; Trump has played more than twice as many rounds of golf than former president Barack Obama had at the same point in his presidency. Trump paid his 276th visit to one of his golf properties on Saturday.

Trump also defended his frequent golf-playing by arguing he often gets work done on the links.

""I play VERY fast, get a lot of work done on the golf course, and also get a 'tiny' bit of exercise. Not bad!"" he tweeted.

Before winning the presidency, Trump was a frequent critic of Obama for playing golf in office. But Trump has spent many weekends at his various golf properties in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia, sometimes bringing lawmakers or business leaders with him.

Trump has long reacted strongly to scrutiny of his physical or mental health, last week claiming to have ""aced"" a cognitive test without providing proof.

It was the president's latest attempt to dismiss questions about his mental capabilities and attempt to call into question those of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

The White House would not provide details of the test or say whether he was referring to a more recent evaluation than the one he underwent in 2018.

Trump's general medical status has frequently been the source of speculation.

In June, the White House provided a positive look at an annual physical, saying the president's cholesterol was down from previous years, but it has never provided a complete explanation for an abrupt November 2019 trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center that the White House claimed was meant to get an early start on his yearly physical.

At the time, the White House said it was a ""routine checkup,"" though it was unannounced and wasn't on the President's internal schedule the morning he went there.

New questions about the president's health surfaced last month when he appeared unsteady while descending a ramp at West Point's commencement ceremony. Trump later raised the episode repeatedly, insisting his leather shoes made walking down the ramp difficult.",[],393,0.930889709832485

The team's news cycle followed a similar model Friday.

Infielder Travis Shaw got things rolling with a string of tweets about the team's closed environment at Rogers Centre and adjoining hotel. Manager Charlie Montoyo then dropped news that Vladimir Guerrero Jr., would be moving to first base. And finally there was word that players who spent the week in Florida had arrived in town.

There is no shortage of storylines in this one-of-a-kind summer that's only just beginning. Where things go from here is anyone's guess.

A main issue remains where the Blue Jays will play home games this season. The federal government granted the team approval to modify the 14-day quarantine rule during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing training camp to begin this week at the domed stadium.

""I'm glad that we're here,"" Montoyo said on a conference call. ""I really am and we're going to follow all the guidelines. I promise you that.""

Earlier in the day, Shaw voiced his concern about the length of time players may need to stay in their current environment. He replied to a tweet from TSN reporter Scott Mitchell, who reported that multiple sources told him players could face a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ballpark -- which also are maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act.

""We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much,"" Shaw tweeted.

We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much https://t.co/6S7euLbHWA — Travis Shaw (@travis_shaw21) July 10, 2020

New York Mets pitcher Marcus Stroman, who spent five seasons with the Blue Jays, added more fuel to the social-media fire when he replied to Mitchell's tweet.

""This is absolutely ridiculous,"" Stroman tweeted, adding in a subsequent post: ""Guys are going to be walking around in full disguises. Lol.""

In an email reply, the club confirmed that before arriving in Toronto, players understood the maximum penalties for leaving the Rogers Centre footprint during camp.

The team has expressed its desire to play home games at the dome during the 60-game regular season. A decision is expected in the coming days.

Players are expected to be advised of specifics on the setup for the upcoming campaign once a finalized plan is in place.

Toronto will travel to Boston for pre-season games July 21 and 22 before the season opener July 24 at Tampa Bay. The Blue Jays' first home game is set for July 29 against Washington.

If Rogers Centre is ruled out for the season, the Blue Jays would likely play at TD Ballpark at their spring-training facility in Dunedin, Fla., but that backup plan has not been finalized.

Florida has been dealing with a spike in COVID-19 cases of late. The state reported 11,385 new cases on Friday while Ontario reported just 116 new cases.

Shaw, who signed with the Blue Jays last December, posted two additional tweets after his original reply but they were later deleted.

""1) Let me be clear. We are on board with the TWO week quarantine. I currently have a PAID for condo a block away from the stadium that I can't use. At no point would I risk public safety or not follow rules. Is it wrong to want to live in a place that I've already paid for...""

He added: ""2) to be able to go on a walk (WITH A MASK) to be able to get fresh air, walk to go get takeout food (not eat inside). We aren't looking to party, hit the patios, go out at night, anything like that. Public safety is priority number 1....""

As Major League Baseball's lone Canadian team, the Blue Jays face an additional hurdle because of the border and quarantine rules during the pandemic. Players and team staff have been isolating from the general public in the so-called 'bubble' of the stadium and hotel at the north end of the building.

""I wanna make it clear, we're not asking for special treatment,"" Blue Jays outfielder Randal Grichuk tweeted Friday. ""We understand that we need to stay in a ""quarantine bubble"". We wanna make sure everyone is safe.

""The toughest part is them not allowing our family to come with us. That's what makes it tough for a lot of guys.""

The Blue Jays have not commented on reports that a single player recently tested positive for COVID-19 in Florida. The positive result forced 12 players to remain in Dunedin, according to USA Today.

Most players -- about 46 in total, Montoyo said earlier in the week -- flew to Toronto on a charter last Sunday.

Without providing specifics, Montoyo said other players arrived in town Thursday and planned to work out before the team's intrasquad game Friday evening.

During his 15-minute video call with reporters, Montoyo confirmed that Guerrero would cross the diamond and focus on first base.

""It's all about a player having the best chance to compete,"" Montoyo said. ""It's going to be a short season. So for me, the best (plan) for Vlad is to play first, DH and also play third.""

Guerrero, who hit 15 homers and drove in 69 runs in his rookie season, said he was on board.

""Wherever the team needs me, I'm going to be ready,"" he said via translator Hector Lebron. ""So I'm OK with that.""

She was 57.

Travolta said in an Instagram post that his wife of 28 years died after a two-year battle with breast cancer.

""It is with a very heavy heart that I inform you that my beautiful wife Kelly has lost her two-year battle with breast cancer,"" Travolta said. ""She fought a courageous fight with the love and support of so many.""

The couple had three children together.

""Shocked by this sad news,"" Maria Shriver said on Twitter. ""Kelly was such a bright loving soul, a talented actress, and a loving mom and wife. My heart breaks for her family who have already known such sadness and grief.""

Born Kelly Kamalelehua Smith on Oct. 13, 1962, in Honolulu, Hawaii, Preston had a lengthy acting career in movies and television beginning in the 1980s, including the 1985 teen comedy ""Mischief,"" 1986's ""Space Camp"" and her breakthrough, 1988's ""Twins."" Preston played Marnie, the woman who marries Schwarzenegger's character.

Preston was first married to actor Kevin Gage. They divorced in 1987.

The year after, Preston met Travolta while shooting the 1989 film ""The Experts,"" a box-office flop about a Soviet KGB agent who hires hip New Yorkers to update the spy program's understanding of American society. They meet on the dance floor after Travolta asks, ""Does anyone here know how to dance."" Preston responds: ""I know how to dance.""

They were married in 1991 at a midnight ceremony in Paris while expecting their first son, Jett.

Preston starred opposite Kevin Costner in the 1999 film ""For the Love of the Game."" In 2003, she starred in ""What a Girl Wants"" and as the mom in the live-action adaptation of ""The Cat in the Hat."" The following year she appeared in the music video for Maroon 5's ""She Will Be Loved.""

Preston gave one of her most well-received performances in ""Jerry Maguire"" as the ex-fiancee of Cruise's sports agent who dumps him early in the movie. The Daily News called her ""icily effective.""

On Monday, Russell Crowe recalled knowing Preston in the '90s. He said he hadn't seen her much since, ""but when I did, she was always the same sparkly eyed gem.""

Preston occasionally appeared in films with her husband, though the results were seldom among either's best work. Among them: the box-office bomb ""Battlefield Earth"" in 2000 and the 2009 Disney comedy ""Old Dogs,"" also with their daughter, Ella Bleu.

In January 2009, Jett Travolta, 16, died after a seizure at the family's vacation home in the Bahamas. The death touched off a court case after an ambulance driver and his attorney were accused of trying to extort $25 million from the actors in exchange for not releasing sensitive information about their son's death.

Travolta testified during a criminal trial that ended in a mistrial and was prepared to testify a second time, but decided to stop pursuing the case and it was dismissed. He cited the severe strain the proceedings and his son's death had caused the family.

Both Preston and Travolta returned to acting, with Preston's first role back in the Nicholas Sparks adaptation, ""The Last Song,"" which starred Miley Cyrus and her future husband, Liam Hemsworth.

In addition to Jett and Ella Bleu, who was born in 2000, the couple had son Benjamin in 2010. Ella wrote on Instagram Sunday: ""I have never met anyone as courageous, strong, beautiful and loving as you. Anyone who is lucky enough to have known you or to have ever been in your presence will agree that you have a glow and a light that never ceases to shine and that makes anyone around you feel instantly happy.""

The couple last starred together in the 2018 film ""Gotti,"" with Travolta playing John Gotti and Preston playing the crime boss's wife, Victoria.

""Kelly's love and life will always be remembered,"" Travolta said on Instagram. ""I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don't hear from us for a while. But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal.""

""I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions, given our family's history, and I'm sincerely sorry about not having done that,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau said he is sorry for how the rollout of the Canada Student Service Grant program went, and he regrets the “unnecessary controversy” it’s caused.

“The mistake that we made was on me, and I take responsibility for it. We will continue to work very, very hard to deliver the program,” Trudeau said, speaking about the ongoing controversy during his first national address on the federal government’s latest COVID-19 response plans from Rideau Cottage in two weeks.

Over the last two weeks, the controversy surrounding the government’s decision to allow the WE Charity to deliver a now-halted $900 million COVID-19 student grant program has grown considerably.

WE Charity backed away from administering the grants amid questions about Trudeau’s involvement, but also in light of a series of news stories about racialized former employees’ experiences with the organization.

The ethics commissioner also launched a probe into a potential conflict of interest with Trudeau’s decision to grant the organization the contract to administer the program, given the prime minister’s close personal ties to the charity.

“This was my mistake. This was me not stepping back from an organization that I should have known to not get involved with, even as prime minister, and allow the public service and non-connected ministers to move forward on delivering this program,” said Trudeau on Monday.

'I DIDN'T KNOW THE DETAILS'

Last week WE Charity confirmed that, over the years, Trudeau’s wife, mother, and brother have received a range of payments amounting to around $300,000 for speaking at WE events. Sophie Gregoire Trudeau is an ambassador with the organization and hosts a mental health podcast under its name. She received a ""one-time speaking honorarium"" of $1,400 for participating in a youth event in 2012, before Trudeau became leader of the Liberal Party.

On Monday, the prime minister faced a series of questions from reporters about whether he knew his family members got paid by WE, and said that, while he was aware of their professional speaking roles, he was unaware of just how much money his family members received.

""I have known, obviously, for many years that my mom has been an extraordinary advocate for mental health issues, a professional public speaker who works with a range of different organizations. Obviously I knew she worked with WE, I didn't know the details of how much she was getting paid by various organizations but I should have and I deeply regret that,” Trudeau said on Monday.

Trudeau said he also regrets bringing his mother, Margaret Trudeau, into the controversy, saying that it was “unfair.”

“I should have been thoughtful enough to recuse myself completely from any discussions around WE because of these connections from the very beginning, and I did not and I'm very sorry about that,” he said.

MORNEAU ALSO APOLOGIZES

Last week Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s office confirmed his daughters have connections to the charity and he also did not recuse himself from the decision-making table. The finance minister’s daughter Clare has spoken at WE events, and his daughter Grace is currently employed by WE Charity.

On Friday, Morneau also apologized for not removing himself from discussions about the student grant program.

“Given the fact that my daughter works for the organization in an unrelated branch, I now realize I should have in order to avoid any perception of conflict. I apologize for not doing so, and moving forward, I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE,” Morneau said in a statement.

STUDENTS LEFT IN LIMBO

Initially, WE Charity was selected to set up placements and administer grants to students and new graduates for their volunteer work this summer.

With the program halted, thousands of students are now in limbo without summer jobs and, for now, no chance for volunteer grants to help cover costs like fall tuition.

The grant to post-secondary students and recent graduates was designed to provide one-time payments of up to $5,000 for volunteering in pandemic-related programs, depending on the number of hours worked. For every 100 hours spent, a student will receive $1,000.

On Monday, Trudeau repeated his regret that his error in judgment has resulted in students hoping to help their communities being left in limbo instead.

“Because of the mistake I made in not withdrawing from these conversations when the public service recommended we move forward with the WE organization, it has gotten a little slower for young people who are facing a difficult time right now, to be able to get involved in their communities and make a difference,” Trudeau said.

Now, Trudeau says the government is looking to Service Canada as a potential avenue to run the program, despite doubling down on the statement that the public service had initially suggested outsourcing the program to WE Charity.

OPPOSITION PARTIES DIG IN

The Conservatives have written to the RCMP suggesting they look into the matter, while two House of Commons studies are underway into various aspects of the controversy.

Now, the opposition is looking to convene a third committee probe, with the intent to uncover as many documents as possible and aiming to call and a slate of cabinet ministers to testify.

Trudeau said a series of cabinet ministers will be testifying this week about the affair, and if he gets an invitation, he will consult with his House of Commons leadership team about attending.

“Obviously, the opposition parties have their job to do and they will keep doing it. I have my job to do as well, which is to make sure that Canadians are well supported through this pandemic and we have an economic restart that goes smoothly,” Trudeau said.

“Revelations that Justin Trudeau’s family was paid to speak at events for an organization, which later received a $900 million sole-source contract, are deeply disturbing,” said Conservative MP and ethics critic Michael Barrett in a statement about the push for a third committee study. “This new information has raised concerns about the way this Liberal government operates and whether the appropriate processes are in place to avoid conflicts of interest,” said Barrett.

Critics have pointed to the WE Charity affair as the latest in a series of ethical oversights Trudeau has had over his time as prime minister.

Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion’s ongoing investigation is now the third ethics investigation Trudeau has been subjected to, with the two previous times — his trip to the Aga Khan’s private island and in relation to the SNC-Lavalin prosecution — resulting in findings that Trudeau had breached federal ethics law. In both cases Trudeau apologized for his improper behaviour, and both times he said he had learned his lesson.

“I feel like it's Groundhog Day. We've seen so many instances where the prime minister gets caught… seems outraged that anyone could question him, and then as the scandal deepens then he apologizes,” said NDP MP and ethics critic Charlie Angus in an interview on CTV News Channel. He said what is most concerning is that no one around Trudeau seemed to try to stop him from getting involved given his close personal ties to the organization.

Angus said the controversy should have never happened and if the proper standards and protocols were in place, it wouldn’t have. He called it “one of the stupidest scandals in Canadian history.”

Asked if he was worried that the controversy puts his minority government on unstable footing after months of positive polling numbers, Trudeau said on Monday that he trusts Canadians will make judgments on his leadership based on the pandemic response as a whole.

In a new statement on their website, WE Charity co-founders Craig Kielburger and Marc Kielburger say they want to “set the record straight” about the entire affair. The brothers wrote about how their organization was qualified to stickhandle the administration of the Canada Student Service Grant program, which had 35,000 applicants a week after launching. But, as their statement notes, “the program was immediately enmeshed in controversy,” and handed back over to the government along with the funding.

“WE has not profited from this contract in any way,” said the Keilburgers, adding that the last two weeks have been “extremely difficult.”

“The charity’s integrity and purpose has been called into question. It has had direct impacts on our staff, supporters, and beneficiaries. We have made mistakes that we sincerely regret,” says the statement.",[],1463,0.5616939631272969

Trevor Florence, owner of the Invermere Soaring Centre, tells CTV News that he had just landed his glider shortly before 7 p.m. on July 10 and conditions were great. He began monitoring the unusual path of another glider using a device for collision avoidance on-board his glider.

The pilot of the airborne glider — who Florence says is a member of a Vancouver-area gliding club — was flying in an area that sparked concern. It appeared from the flight path that the glider was ""flying itself"" for several minutes before coming to an abrupt halt.

An emergency call was placed to RCMP, B.C. Ambulance and local search and rescue.

Ahead of the arrival of emergency personnel, Florence asked a helicopter pilot to help him survey the area for the downed glider. Within minutes, the pair spotted it from the air and the aircraft's cockpit appeared unscathed.

Florence was dropped near the site with a first-aid kit and he made his way to the wreckage where he discovered the pilot was alive and semi-conscious.

A helicopter with a doctor and members of Columbia Valley Search and Rescue arrived on scene and retrieved the man using a gurney and rope-rescue system.

Florence says the search and rescue crews did a ""marvelous job"" in reaching the scene in short order and commends the doctor for her actions.

""She was fantastic,"" he said.

The pilot of the downed glider was transported by helicopter to the Invermere Hospital and arrived within three hours of the crash.

According to Florence, the pilot had suffered a neurological issue in the minutes prior to the crash and suffered no serious injuries.

Due to the nature of his medical concerns, the pilot was airlifted from the Invermere Hospital and arrived at the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary early Saturday morning.

Florence says, as of Monday morning, the glider pilot remains in hospital in Calgary where he has been able to sit upright and talk.

It's a record of which the Nishnawbe Aski Police Service is proud, especially in light of the recent uproar in North America over police killings and brutality involving Indigenous, Black, and mentally distressed people. It's a record achieved in communities frequently in social distress, places where hunting rifles and shotguns are ubiquitous.

The key difference from urban, non-Indigenous policing, insiders and observers say, is the relationship building between officers and the people they serve.

""In the past, you might have been the only officer in there,"" Roland Morrison, chief of NAPS says from Thunder Bay, Ont. ""You would have no radio, you've got no backup, so you really effectively have to use your communication and talk to people. You have to develop relationships with the communities in order to have positive policing.""

Inaugurated in 1994, NAPS is responsible for policing more than 38,000 people in 34 communities, many beyond remote, across a vast, largely untamed swath of northern Ontario. Currently the service has 203 officers, about 60 per cent of them Indigenous, Morrison says. Its mandate is culturally responsive policing.

Erick Laming, a criminology PhD candidate at the University of Toronto, says people from First Nation communities -- many with an ingrained suspicion of police given the brutal realities of generations of enforced residential school attendance -- have a higher level of trust when officers are Indigenous.

In contrast, he said, new RCMP recruits with no such background might find themselves in Nunavut or Yukon confronted with significant language and cultural barriers.

""If you're from the community, you have those lived experiences. You can relate to people. You just know how to deal with the issues,"" says Laming, who is from the Shabot Obaadjiwan First Nation north of Kingston, Ont.

""If you don't have that history, you can have all the cultural-sensitivity training in the world, you'll never fully be able to fully integrate into that situation.""

Another example, he said, is the service in Kahnawake, Que., which calls itself the Kahnawake Peacekeepers rather than a police force.

While all officers in Ontario undergo the same basic training, the province's nine Indigenous police services are fundamentally different from their non-Indigenous counterparts.

For one thing, they are not deemed an essential service, although federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said last month that policing First Nations communities should be. Nor are those in Ontario subject to the provincial Police Services Act, which mandates standards, including for an extensive oversight framework.

Now, the process for filing complaints against members of an Indigenous police force is ad hoc, although NAPS does have a professional standards branch and will on occasion call in Ontario Provincial Police. Officers have been disciplined, charged or even fired for excessive use of force.

Another difference is that Indigenous forces are completely reliant on the vagaries of government program funding -- with Ottawa footing 52 per cent of the bill and provinces 48 per cent. The current operations budget for NAPS, for example, is around $37.7 million -- more than its peers -- with expenses approaching $40 million.

The upshot, particularly in years gone by, has been a dire shortage of officers and even of basic facilities and equipment that urbanites can scarcely imagine. In more than a dozen cases, Indigenous self-administered police services in Canada have simply folded.

Now retired, Terry Armstrong, who spent 22 years with Ontario Provincial Police as well as five years as chief of NAPS, says people would be shocked to find out just how poorly funded First Nations policing has been.

Armstrong recounts how a few years ago, in the Hudson Bay community of Fort Severn, Ont., a NAPS officer found himself dealing with a homicide. Besides having to secure three crime scenes and the body, the lone officer had to arrest the suspect and deal with a separate gun call. Bad weather prevented any forensic or other help flying in until the following day.

One thing he always stressed to newcomers as chief, Armstrong says, is the importance of treating people respectfully.

""Some day, they're going to be your backup. When stuff goes south, you're going to need people to support you,"" he says. ""If you're going to be a dick ... when you need help, they aren't going to be there for you.""

One frigid afternoon in February 2013, the only on-duty NAPS officer in Kasabonika Lake First Nation in Ontario's far north detained Lena Anderson, an intoxicated young mother upset over the apprehension of her daughter. The new detachment portable was unheated. The old holding cell was unusable because prisoners could escape through holes in the floor.

The arresting officer left Anderson, 23, in the caged back seat of his Ford 150 police truck for warmth while he went to get help from his off-duty colleague. Alone for 16 minutes, Anderson strangled herself.

The tragedy, combined with a threatened strike over working conditions by NAPS officers, caused an uproar. The situation, says Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler, prompted his Nishnawbe Aski Nation to take a stand. Governments, he said, had to do better or face the far more daunting prospect of doing the policing themselves.

As a result, Fiddler says, a new funding agreement was reached in 2018 that allowed the hiring of 79 new officers over five years and critical infrastructure upgrades to detachments and poor or non-existent communication systems. Most importantly, he said, the deal set in motion pending Ontario legislation that would finally allow First Nations police services to opt in to the Police Services Act, putting in place solid standards and accountability mechanisms.

""That's something our communities and citizens deserve."" Fiddler says. ""If they have an issue with NAPS, there should be a forum for them to pursue their grievance.""

However, giving investigative authority to the province's Special Investigations Unit or Office of the Independent Police Review Director must come with cultural safety built in, he says.

Stephen Leach, current review director, says his office is not yet involved in the opt-in process.

""My expectation is that once the Community Safety and Policing Act is proclaimed and the opt-in process is further along, then I would be involved in explaining how the public complaints process works, and listening to how it might have to be adapted to meet the needs of First Nations communities,"" Leach says.

Stephen Warner, a spokesman for Ontario Solicitor General Sylvia Jones, confirmed the government was working on regulations to the new act. Part of the work, he said, was to set clear and consistent standards for policing delivery ""informed by, and responsive to, the views of the communities that police are both a part of and serve.""

Toronto-based lawyer Julian Falconer calls the new legislation a game changer. Despite having devoted much of his career to holding police accountable, he says he has no qualms in representing NAPS.

Despite, or perhaps because of, their chronic lack of resources, Falconer says Indigenous police behave much differently from their urban counterparts. He cites the dearth of police killings and racist behaviours that have sown deep mistrust of policing among Indigenous, Black and marginalized groups.

""Mainstream policing has a lot to learn from Indigenous policing,"" Falconer said. ""The relationship between community and policing is so dramatically different.""

""If the basics aren't followed, there is only one way this pandemic is going to go,""said the director of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""It's going to get worse and worse and worse.""

Debate over the risks the virus poses, and how best to fight it, were spotlighted in Florida after it shattered the record among U.S. states for the largest single-day increase, with more than 15,000 newly confirmed cases.

Officials and health experts in hard-hit Miami pushed back against pressure, both from Gov. Ron DeSantis and President Donald Trump, to bring students back to classrooms next month.

""We just absolutely cannot risk the health of children, their well-being and safety, or any of our colleagues,"" said Karla Hernandez-Mats, president of the United Teachers of Dade union and a middle school teacher herself. ""We're probably going to have to go to a full shutdown mode. I can't see the schools reopening except with the 100% virtual model.""

Parents have until Wednesday to notify the Miami-Dade school district of their decision whether they will send their kids to school this fall or have them study online from home.

""Children can get get the virus in their bodies and get contaminated just like anybody else,"" said Florida International University epidemiologist Dr. Aileen Marty, who has been advising the Miami school district on its reopening plans.

DeSantis has argued that children have not proven to be vectors for the disease and that if retailers like Walmart can be reopened safely, then schools should be able to as well. But he made those arguments with a notable caveat, saying that each county should make it own decision on reopening in consultation with local health officials.

The debate is hardly limited to Florida.

In Detroit, where summer school classes for hundreds of students opened Monday, protesters blocked a school bus yard with tree branches.

""When I visited schools this morning I knew we were doing the right thing for children,"" schools Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said, in a post on Twitter.

""COVID is not going away. Many of our children need face-to-face, direct engagement,"" he said.

But lawyer Shanta Driver said she planned to file a lawsuit to stop the in-person instruction.

""I'm not going back until this pandemic is defeated. There is not a safe way to return to school while this virus is spreading uncontained,"" said teacher Benjamin Royal.

Officials in California's two largest school districts, Los Angeles and San Diego, announced Monday that students will stick to online learning from home when school resumes next month, rather than return to classrooms.

The districts cited research about school safety experiences from around the world, along with state and local health guidance.

""One fact is clear: Those countries that have managed to safely reopen schools have done so with declining infection rates and on-demand testing available. California has neither,"" the districts said in a joint statement. Los Angeles, the second largest school district in the U.S., has about 730,000 students and San Diego serves about 135,000 students.

In North Carolina, which reported its highest one-day number of cases and hospitalizations, Gov. Roy Cooper has asked school districts to prepare three re-opening plans that include options for in-person and fully remote learning. His decision is expected later this week.

But teacher Becky Maxam, whose husband is considered high-risk for the virus because of a genetic heart condition, said she doesn't plan to return if her Charlotte middle school reopens.

""I'm not going back if we're opening up. I can't risk my family,"" Maxam said. ""I think we should be virtual until we find a vaccine or cases go down much more than what they are.""

The debate over what to do about schools came as a pair of WHO experts were in China for a mission to trace the origin of the pandemic. The virus was first detected in central China's city of Wuhan late last year. Beijing had been reluctant to allow a probe but relented after scores of countries called on the WHO to conduct a thorough investigation.

China has argued that the virus might have originated outside of China and has angrily denied allegations that it covered up the scale of the outbreak as infections first began to spread.

Also Monday, the United Nations warned that the pandemic could cause 130 million more people worldwide to go hungry this year.

U.N. officials estimate there were about 690 million people in 2019 who went hungry worldwide, with the majority in Asia and Africa.

""While it is too soon to assess the full impact of the lockdowns and other containment measures,"" the agency said that, at a minimum, another 83 million would go hungry as a result of the pandemic.

The WHO's Tedros said the consequences would be worst for the world's most vulnerable populations. But he noted Monday that the most recent surge in cases had come in the Americas. The United States and Brazil alone account for more than a third of all global deaths from the disease.

""I really do think we could control this, and it's the human element that is so critical. It should be an effort of our country. We should be pulling together when we're in a crisis, and we're definitely not doing it,"" said University of Florida epidemiologist Cindy Prins.

But with Trump pressuring school districts to reopen this fall, and with the academic year in some southern states just weeks away, the debate over how to respond to the resurgence is growing more heated.

Trump has harshly criticized the WHO over its response to the coronavirus pandemic and accused it of bowing to Chinese influence. The Trump administration formally notified the U.N. last week of its withdrawal from WHO, although the pullout won't take effect until July 6, 2021.

In Japan, more than 30 Marines tested positive at the Futenma U.S. air station on Okinawa, where infections among American service members have rapidly risen to more than 90 since last week. Okinawa is home to more than half of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan.

In other parts of the world, the number of infections has been rising dramatically in India, South Africa and Brazil, whose virus-denying president has tested positive.

India, which has the most confirmed virus cases after the United States and Brazil, on Monday reported a record daily surge of 28,701 new cases reported in the past 24 hours. Authorities in several cities are reinstating strict lockdowns after attempting to loosen things up to revive an ailing economy.

In South Africa, which accounts for over 40% of all the reported coronavirus cases in Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa reimposed a ban on alcohol sales and a nighttime curfew to reduce the number of people needing emergency treatment so hospitals have more beds to treat COVID-19 patients.

""We are taking these measures fully aware that they impose unwelcome restrictions on people's lives. They are, however, necessary to see us through the peak of the disease,"" Ramaphosa said in a letter to the nation Monday. ""There is no way that we can avoid the coronavirus storm. But we can limit the damage that it can cause to our lives.""

The moves to undercut Fauci come just days after he gave an unvarnished look at his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, including that they have not spoken in weeks.

The tension between the two men -- who are no longer speaking, CNN reported last week -- has grown publicly as they have responded to one another through interviews and statements. But recent moves by the White House to publicly diminish the nation's top infectious disease expert amounts to a significant escalation as it seeks to divert attention from the government's failure to contain the coronavirus and instead push Trump's call to reopen the country. That effort continued Monday morning, when the President retweeted a baseless claim by game show host Chuck Woolery that ""everyone is lying"" about the coronavirus -- including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In a statement Saturday, a White House official told CNN that ""several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things."" The official went on to provide a lengthy list of examples, citing Fauci's comments early in the pandemic and linking to past interviews.

These bullet points, which resembled opposition research on a political opponent, included Fauci downplaying the virus early on and a quote from March when Fauci said, ""People should not be walking around with masks,"" among other comments. Not included were previous statements from the surgeon general urging people not to buy masks or an acknowledgment of the President's own false claims and misstatements about the virus.

Fauci did not return a request for comment by CNN. But in a recent series of newspaper and radio interviews, Fauci, who has worked under six U.S. presidents from both parties, has at times openly disagreed with Trump.

In particular, a recent interview with the Financial Times in which Fauci disclosed that he has not briefed the President in weeks prompted the White House to distribute the list of Fauci statements, an aide familiar with the matter said. Among other things, Fauci disputed Trump's claim that ""99%"" of coronavirus cases in the United States were ""totally harmless"" -- saying that was ""obviously not the case"" -- and drew a connection between his insistence on ""speaking the truth at all times"" to his noticeably diminished television appearances.

A person familiar with the situation acknowledged that Fauci has been appearing on television less frequently because Trump is annoyed by his public statements. Though Trump was already miffed by Fauci's television appearances early on, the White House has sought to downplay tension between the two for several months. The press shop stopped approving Fauci's television appearances, believing it would help alleviate the situation, though they continued to allow him to give interviews with print outlets.

Another person familiar has said the rare in-person meetings between Trump and Fauci are not awkward and don't involve raised voices, but Trump has complained about Fauci privately. Sources say part of that irritation is over the ""good press"" Fauci has received. Trump's irritation with Fauci has also, at times, been encouraged by Peter Navarro, Trump's trade adviser who has repeatedly blamed Fauci for doubting the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.

Navarro once told Fauci he would be personally responsible if it was later shown that hydroxychloroquine worked to treat coronavirus, despite multiple studies questioning its use.

One senior administration official told CNN that some officials within the White House do not trust Fauci. According to the source, those officials think Fauci doesn't have the best interest of the President, pointing to some of Fauci's interviews. Other administration officials have told CNN that while they have disagreements with Fauci's methods, they don't doubt his motives, and that his only concern was public health.

In an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday, Adm. Brett Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said there is ""open discourse"" within the team.

""I respect Dr. Fauci a lot, but Dr. Fauci is not 100% right and he also doesn't necessarily -- and he admits that -- have the whole national interest in mind. He looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view,"" Giroir said.

Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at Health and Human Services Michael Caputo said Sunday there was no White House-versus-the scientists narrative.

""We have great faith in the capacity of all of our scientists and doctors on the coronavirus taskforce to impart necessary public health information. People like Admiral (Brett) Giroir, Surgeon General (Jerome) Adams and others are carrying these messages very effectively,"" Caputo said in the statement, although he did not directly answer questions about Fauci.

Fauci is scheduled to be in the West Wing Monday for meetings.

TRUMP PUBLICLY CRITICIZES FAUCI

Trump -- who in April retweeted a message calling for Fauci to be fired, though he later downplayed the significance of the message when asked -- has recently intensified his public criticism of Fauci in recent weeks.

""Dr. Fauci is a nice man, but he's made a lot of mistakes,"" Trump said last week, undermining the public health expert whom Americans say in polls they trust more than the President.

In recent interviews, he openly questioned the advice he'd received from Fauci at the start of the outbreak.

""I think we are in a good place. I disagree with him,"" Trump said in an interview Tuesday when questioned about Fauci's assertion the U.S. is still ""knee-deep in the first wave"" of the pandemic.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said Sunday evening that any effort by the White House to sideline or discredit Fauci is ""just atrocious.""

Schiff told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" that such a move ""is so characteristic of Donald Trump. He can't stand the fact that the American people trust Dr. Fauci and they don't trust Donald Trump -- and so he has to tear him down.""

""We need people more than ever to speak truth to power, to be able to level with the American people about what we're facing with this pandemic, how to get it under control, how to protect ourselves and our families,"" Schiff continued. ""That's what Dr. Fauci has been trying to do and by sidelining him the President is once again interfering with an effective response to this pandemic.""

Kathleen Sebelius, who served as secretary of Health and Human Services under former President Barack Obama, told CNN efforts to discredit Fauci and other scientists are ""potentially very, very dangerous"" as the US and other countries work toward a coronavirus vaccine.

""I think people want to know from the scientists that the vaccine is safe, that it is effective, that it will not do more harm than good,"" she told Blitzer on ""The Situation Room.""

""And if the public scientists have been discredited, if the President says 'don't believe them, you can't listen to them, they're often wrong,' we have then undermined a national vaccination campaign which is an essential step to bringing this horrible period to an end.""

Prosecutors made the revelation in court papers as they argued there is no reason to free Ghislaine Maxwell on bail.

The 58-year-old British socialite has been held without bail since her recent arrest at a $1 million New Hampshire estate she bought late last year.

Prosecutors told a Manhattan federal judge in written arguments that at least one woman and possibly more were expected to exercise their right to appear at Tuesday's hearing and ask that Maxwell be detained until trial.

“The Government is deeply concerned that if the defendant is bailed, the victims will be denied justice in this case,” prosecutors wrote.

The filing came a day before an arraignment and bail hearing for Maxwell, who has been held for the last week at a federal jail in Brooklyn.

On Friday, her lawyers filed arguments that said she's being made a scapegoat after Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan lockup last August. They said she should be freed on $5 million bail with electronic monitoring.

“Ghislaine Maxwell,” they wrote, “is not Jeffrey Epstein.”

They said their client denies any allegations of misconduct, has had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade and has never been charged with a crime or found liable in civil litigation stemming from the allegations against Epstein.

Prosecutors noted that Maxwell's defence lawyers proposed offering as collateral property their client owns in the United Kingdom, but they said that was beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.

Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges of women and girls in Florida and New York in the early 2000s when he died by suicide in custody.",[],308,0.974256530922277

In the first study of its kind, a team led by researchers from King's College London examined the levels of antibodies in more than 90 confirmed virus patients and how they changed over time.

Blood tests showed even individuals with only mild COVID-19 symptoms mounted some immune response to the virus.

Of the study group, 60 per cent showed a ""potent"" viral response in the first few weeks after infection.

However, after three months only 16.7 per cent had maintained high levels of COVID-19-neutralizing antibodies, and after 90 days several patients had no detectable antibodies in their bloodstream.

When the body encounters an external danger such as a virus, it mobilises cells to track down and kill the culprit.

As it does so, it produces proteins known as antibodies that are programmed to target the specific antigen the body is fighting, like a key cut for a particular lock.

As long as someone has enough antibodies, they will be able to snub out new infections, giving them immunity.

But Monday's research suggests immunity cannot be taken for granted and may not last more than a few months, as is true with other viruses such as influenza.

'PLAYING THE LOTTERY'

Experts said the findings may change how governments plan for the next phase of the pandemic, including how they fund and organise vaccine research and development.

""This is an important study that starts to define the longer-term dynamics of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2,"" said Lawrence Young, professor of Molecular Oncology at the University of Warwick, using the full name of the virus strain.

""It further emphasises the need for us to better understand what a protective immune response looks like if we are to develop an effective vaccine,"" said Young, who was not involved in the research.

James Gill, an honorary Clinical Lecturer at Warwick Medical School, said the research reiterated the need for everyone to continue taking measures to mitigate the virus spreading, particularly at the start of Europe's holiday season.

""In the same way that these patients were surprised to have antibodies to COVID19, we should NOT be surprised if any protective benefit is mild, or at least transient,"" he said.

""If you played the lottery and won £10, you wouldn't immediately think that you had acquired increased natural luck, and used your life savings to buy further lottery tickets.

""Even those with a positive antibody test -- especially those who cannot account for where they may have been exposed -- should continue to use caution, social distancing and appropriate mask use.""",[],445,0.9674550578656056

Both said they had chosen to publicize the infections on their own, with one deciding to close for cleaning too, without being asked by authorities to do either thing.

“Although we have not been contacted by Quebec Public Health,” wrote management of La Voûte bar in Old Montreal on Friday, “it is our civic responsibility to inform you.”

They’re right, say public health authorities: bars are not required to warn clients in these cases, or to close.

“A bar does not have to close if there has been a [person who tested positive] that frequented it during his or her infectious period,” said Marie-Claude Lacasse, a spokeswoman for Quebec’s health department.

This, however, is because health authorities are supposed to already be on top of the situation through contact tracing, and their system doesn’t rely on establishments reporting this kind of concern.

Instead, it starts with individual people’s positive test results and works backwards, including checking if they’ve been at a bar or restaurant.

“These are assessments that are made by the public health [regional authorities], depending on the situation,” wrote Lacasse.

For example, in the case of a bar, was the infected person an employee or a client? How long did they spend in the bar, and were people complying at the time with other health measures?

“In the same vein, a public place or a workplace is not necessarily closed if a positive case has been present,” she said. It depends on a variety of factors.

It’s not that being forthcoming is to be discouraged, others said.

“It would be weird for us to say no, right,” if a bar owner wanted to take that initiative, said Jean Nicolas Aubé, a spokesperson for Montreal’s public health department.

However, he thinks people should know that contact tracers get to work quickly on every single positive test result, contacting the person involved.

“It generally is within the day. It’s very fast,” said Aubé.

Montreal’s public health department doesn’t comment on specific contact tracing cases, including the two bar-associated ones this week, he said.

An infectious diseases specialist agreed that it can’t hurt to give people more warning,

“As a physician I would say that is an admirable effort,” said Dr. Matthew Oughton of McGill, speaking of bar owners’ COVID-19 transparency.

However, he’d want to make sure they “can do it in a way that, as much as possible, protects the right to privacy of people's medical information,” he said.

Oughton also said people shouldn’t panic at the idea that they won’t always hear about cases they crossed paths with. The risk should still be fairly low, and it’s important to remember that prior to this kind of announcement, “what [public health] did behind the scenes is invisible.”

Closing and doing a deep clean makes a lot of sense for a business owner for other reasons, however, said Oughton.

“From a practical perspective, if I were a customer and I found out there were cases at a bar and the bar knew and didn't say anything… I don't think that would be a very smart public relations route,” he said.

There’s one last thing to keep in mind about human nature—a reason not to announce every single positive case, he said.

“Would I recommend that every single business declare every time they have an employee or customer who's positive?” he asked.

“My concerns there are... you hear an alert the first time, it catches your attention. You hear an alert the hundredth time, it loses its impact.”",[],598,0.8988316760771291

This comes as Trudeau spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday morning, though the border was not among the range of topics the prime minister said the two world leaders discussed — despite the looming July 21 deadline.

""Every month we have been able to extend the border closures to all but essential goods and services and those discussions are ongoing with the United States right now as we are a week from the next deadline for closures,"" Trudeau said.

""We're going to continue to work hard to keep Canadians safe and to keep our economies flowing, we will have more to say later this week I'm sure.""

Canada has been under renewed pressure to reopen the shared border, despite surging COVID-19 case numbers in the United States. At the end of June, the U.S. became home to the world’s highest number of reported infections: more than 2.2 million. That number has since soared to more than 3.3 million, according to the New York Times, with more than 134,000 deaths.

Despite these figures, 29 bipartisan members of U.S. Congress penned an open letter to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair calling on the Canadian government to plan a phased reopening of the Canada-U.S. border and to consider easing existing measures.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions,"" read the letter, which was published on Western New York Congressman Brian Higgins' website on July 3.

The members of Congress, who represent the northern states along the border, also implored the Canadian government to consider easing restrictions on family members and property owners impeded by the restrictions.

The Canadian government pushed back on the request, with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland's office telling CTVNews.ca in a statement that the health and safety of Canadians is ""absolutely priority.""

""Decisions about Canada's border are made by Canadians, for Canadians,"" Freeland's spokesperson Katherine Cuplinskas said in the statement on Friday.

The suggestion was also unpopular with non-politician Canadians, who took to social media to express their staunch opposition.

In response to a tweet from Higgins, who had shared the open letter on his Twitter account, hundreds of Canadians slammed the suggestion.

""No thank you...clean up your backyard before you attempt to enter ours..sincerely Canada,"" wrote a user who goes by the name @MichelletypoQ.

Another user, @rachelinTO, wrote that ""most of our earliest cases came from the U.S. So......that's a firm 'no'. Sorry, eh.""

Users called the request ""disastrous"" and multiple accounts said they’d only be comfortable easing restrictions after seeing improvement in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.

TRUMP, TRUDEAU DISCUSS TARIFF THREAT

While Trudeau did not give any indication in his press conference that he and Trump had touched on the border issue during their phone call on Monday, he did confirm that the two discussed a host of other issues — including China and the two detained Canadians, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the U.S. president’s renewed aluminium tariff threat.

""I impressed upon him that it would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time where we’re celebrating NAFTA , and at a time where we want our businesses and our manufacturers to get going as quickly as possible,"" Trudeau said.

""We pledged to keep working on it together.""

Trudeau also said he told Trump that the pandemic had disrupted the usual supply chains and manufacturing processes, but that this disruption is slowly subsiding.

""That is starting to realign itself, given the economies are starting up again and manufacturing is getting going,"" Trudeau said.

CTV News confirmed the possibility of the U.S. slapping another set of tariffs on Canada at the end of June. The tariffs would fall under Section 232 of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act, and the threat comes amid U.S. claims that their aluminum market is being flooded by Canadian product.

Two Canadian sources told CTV News at the time that the announcement is possible in the coming weeks, though to date no formal announcement of tariffs has transpired.

Should the U.S. decide to re-impose tariffs on Canada, it would reopen a trade rift between the two countries that had been healing since a spat just over a year ago, that saw the U.S. impose tariffs on steel and aluminum and Canada answer with tariffs on a wide array of U.S. products including quiche, mayonnaise, and toilet paper.

Trudeau has been outspoken in his defence of Canada's aluminum industry, noting when the possibility of the U.S. imposing new tariffs emerged recently, that the U.S. ""needs Canadian aluminum"" and would only be hurting its own economy.

""Our economies are so interlinked that punitive actions by the United States administration end up hurting Americans the same way they end up hurting Canadians,"" Trudeau said at the time.",[],837,0.845492647524094

The liftoff of the UAE's Mars orbiter named Amal, or Hope, on a Japanese H-IIA rocket is scheduled for early Wednesday from the Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan, in what would be the Arab world's first interplanetary mission.

A final decision will be made Tuesday before the roll out of the rocket, said Keiji Suzuki, launch site director for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

A seasonal rain front was expected to cause intermittent lightning and rain over the next few days, he said.

""But this thunder is not expected to be severe or lasting, and our assessment is that there will be a chance for a launch,"" Suzuki told an online briefing Monday from Tanegashima. ""We will make a careful decision based on data.""

Heavy rain has continued for more than a week in large areas of Japan, triggering mudslides and floods and killing more than 70 people, most of them on the southern main island of Kyushu.

Hope is set to reach Mars in February 2021, the year the UAE celebrates 50 years since its formation. A successful Hope mission would be a major step for the oil-dependent economy seeking a future in space.

Hope carries three instruments to study the upper atmosphere and monitor climate change and is scheduled to circle the red planet for at least two years.

Emirates Mars Mission Project Director Omran Sharaf, who joined Monday's briefing from Dubai, said the mission is not just a repeat of what other countries have done. It will provide a complete view of the Martian atmosphere during different seasons for the first time, he said.

Two other Mars missions are planned in coming days by the U.S. and China. Japan has its own Martian moon mission planned in 2024.",[],318,0.9840219402295656

Locals said waves of waste -- mostly plastic bottles, fishing nets and buoys -- floated ashore late Saturday. They spotted turtle carcasses among the sand dunes early Sunday.

Bangladesh's forestry department said it was the first time such a large volume of plastic had washed onto the 120-kilometre beach along the Bay of Bengal.

""Hundreds of locals rushed to the beach since early morning to rescue the wounded turtles,"" forestry spokesman Sohail Hossain told AFP.

""We have buried the dead ones and are trying to release the rescued turtles back to sea.""

Beach clean-up charity Plastic Bank Bangladesh said their volunteers found and buried at least 20 Olive Ridley turtles among the estimated 50 tonnes of waste spread out over a 10 kilometre stretch of the beach at Cox's Bazar.

""I haven't seen these many dead turtles lying on the beach in my life and also haven't seen such a massive pile of waste floating ashore,"" fisherman Jashim Uddin told AFP.

Leading Bangladesh turtle and tortoise expert Shahriar Caesar Rahman of the NGO Creative Conservation Alliance said most of the turtles were at least 30 years old.

""The turtles often get trapped in gigantic waste patches floating in the sea and eventually die of suffocation. This seems to be a similar case,"" he told AFP.

About 26 tonnes of waste produced from ships and neighbouring countries float into Bay of Bengal every year, said Moazzem Hossain of local conservation charity Save the Nature Bangladesh.

""This is a unique case of plastic invasion. It sends a great danger signal to our marine biodiversity,"" he said.

It was not clear how many turtles were rescued.

Local district administrator Kamal Hossain said authorities were investigating the incident.

Olive Ridleys are the most abundant of all sea turtles around the world, according to conservationists.

The case, brought by Amnesty International in January, called on the court to prevent NSO from selling its technology abroad, especially to repressive regimes.

The Tel Aviv District Court ruled that Amnesty's attorneys did not provide sufficient evidence ""to prove the claim that an attempt was made to track a human rights activist by trying to hack his cellphone"" or that the hacking was done by NSO.

""Granting a license is done after the most rigorous process and also after granting the permit, the authority conducts oversight and close inspection, as necessary,"" the court said. If human rights are found to be violated, that permit can be suspended or cancelled, it added.

The court issued its ruling on Sunday, but only made it public on Monday.

Gil Naveh, spokesman for Amnesty International Israel, said the group was disappointed but not surprised.

""It's been a longstanding tradition for the Israeli courts to be a rubber stamp for the Israeli Ministry of Defence,"" he said.

The group doesn't know what evidence NSO or the Defence Ministry gave to the court, because the hearings were closed. ""Even if we knew, we were not able to talk about it,"" he said.

In 2018, Amnesty claimed one of its employees was targeted by NSO's malware, saying a hacker tried to break into the staffer's smartphone, using a WhatsApp message about a protest in front of the Saudi Embassy in Washington as bait.

NSO, an Israeli hacker-for-hire company, uses its Pegasus spyware to take control of a phone, its cameras and microphones, and mine the user's personal data.

The company has been accused of selling its surveillance software to repressive governments that use it against dissidents. It doesn't disclose clients, but they are believed to include Middle Eastern and Latin American states. The company says it sells its technology to Israeli-approved governments to help them combat criminals and terrorism.

NSO Group said in a statement that the company ""will continue to work to provide technology to states and intelligence organizations,"" adding that its purpose is to ""save human lives.""

In a report published last month, Amnesty International said Moroccan journalist Omar Radi's phone was tapped using NSO's technology as part of the government's efforts to clamp down on dissent.

Most of Schumacher's wins were during a dominant spell with Ferrari, but his old team is struggling badly. For the second time in the past four races, Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel crashed into each other and went out.

When Hamilton stood on the podium he raised a clenched right fist.

Hamilton's record-extending 89th career pole on a rain-drenched track was one of his best in extreme conditions, but during the race he was hardly challenged as he finished a sizeable 13.7 seconds ahead of Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas and 33.7 ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen.

Because of social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic, the drivers on the podium had their trophies delivered by a remote controlled device.

""What a weird year but (it's) great to be back driving with this kind of performance. The team did a fantastic job, it was just for me to bring it home,"" said Hamilton, who finished fourth last week after a time penalty. ""Difficult weekend last weekend but this was a great step forward.""

Montreal's Lance Stroll of Racing Point was seventh, picking up six points. Toronto rookie Nicholas Latifi of Williams Mercedes was 17th.

Bottas won last weekend's season-opening Austrian GP on the same Red Bull Ring track in Spielberg at the foot of the Styrian mountains -- hence the name change.

Despite the sizeable margin of Hamilton's win, Bottas maintains he can challenge for the F1 title. He leads in points 43-37.

""I have no reason to doubt any of my ability or skills. I know what I'm capable of,"" the Finnish driver said. ""I really feel some improvements in my driving since last year that's why I'm confident it will be a good battle for the championship this year.""

Like last Sunday, drivers again wore black T-shirts with ""End Racism"" and most took the knee a few moments before the national anthem.

Red Bull driver Alexander Albon did well to fend off persistent attacks from Racing Point's Sergio Perez and finished fourth ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris and Perez, who dropped to sixth after touching wheels with Albon late on.

McLaren's Carlos Sainz Jr. started from third and finished ninth, but collected a bonus point for the fastest lap.

At the start of the race, Hamilton got away cleanly while Verstappen did well to hold off Sainz.

Leclerc tried to overtake down the right entering a hairpin bend and ended up riding over the back of Vettel's car, mangling his rear wing and prompting a safety car to come out for two laps.

Vettel, who finished 10th last week, had to retire while Leclerc came into the pits on Lap 5 and was soon out of the race.

At last season's penultimate GP in Brazil, both Ferrari cars crashed out. Vettel appeared at fault that time after being overtaken cleanly by Leclerc and trying to regain position.

But this time Leclerc was far too hasty and impatient.

Up ahead, Hamilton was coasting and about five seconds clear of Verstappen when the Dutch driver came in for his first tire change on Lap 25 of 71.

Hamilton came in for fresh tires soon after and then Bottas a few laps later, meaning that by Lap 38 Verstappen was second again -- still five seconds adrift of Hamilton.

Verstappen's front wing was damaged on the right side and, with six laps remaining, his lead over Bottas was down to under a second.

Bottas overtook Verstappen on the next lap but Verstappen regained his position superbly, only to concede it again moments later as Bottas' superior speed proved decisive.

""When Valtteri tried to pass me I tried to make it a bit more difficult,"" Verstappen said. ""The podium is good but there's still a lot of work to do.""

Red Bull showed signs late last season that it was closing the gap on Mercedes, but this time Verstappen is not convinced a serious challenge can be mounted.

""I tried everything I could but it's still not enough,"" Verstappen said. ""As a team we want to win and fight for the championship, and to do that we need to win races.""

Renault driver Esteban Ocon was the other driver not to finish, but teammate Daniel Ricciardo was eighth behind Stroll.

The virus kept them apart for 114 days.

Daniel said the isolation took a toll on her 66-year-old husband, who has Alzheimer's. So when the facility offered her a part-time dishwashing job, she jumped at the opportunity.

""I told them, 'I'm gonna be the best dishwasher you've ever had, because I want to be here, because I need to be with him,'"" she told CNN.

Before COVID-19, Daniel said she would help her husband get ready for bed each night and they would watch TV together before she tucked him in.

""That was our set routine and then all of a sudden I'm gone,"" she said. ""And he doesn't know why. He can't understand why.""

She said they've tried doing window visits, but they upset Steve. He can't carry on conversations, she said, so visiting over FaceTime didn't work well for them either.

Daniel, 57, said that getting to see her husband after she's done working is a perk, but she's scrubbing dishes, mopping floors and cleaning the kitchen just like any dishwasher.

""It is full on legit, I had to do a COVID test, a TB test, 20 hours worth of video training and a drug test,"" she said, adding that she was going to use her paychecks to do something nice for the rest of the staff.

She worked her first shift on July 3, and said Steve recognized her, even with her mask on.

""I walked into his room and he said my name, he said Mary, which was also a relief,"" she said. ""So when he said, Mary, and gave me the biggest hug, I mean, we both cried.""

She said her husband seems much more relaxed since she's been able to see him, and he even gave her a hug during a recent shift.

""He came up from behind me and put his arms around the front of me ... which is an incredible feeling,"" she said. ""So, he knows who I am. There's no question, he knows who I am even in a mask.""

Florida issued an emergency order in March that prohibits visits to nursing homes, assisted living and other long-term care facilities, except for families and friends in end-of-life circumstances. Gov. Ron DeSantis extended the restrictions this week for another 60 days.

The state has become a hotspot, and officials on Friday reported 11,433 new COVID-19 cases and 93 deaths, according to data on the Florida Department of Health (DOH) website.

""Visitor restrictions have been put in place at communities across our state as a safety measure, aimed at protecting the vulnerable population we serve. But it has been hard on families and residents alike, so we felt creative solutions were necessary, especially in the case of Mary and Steve,"" said Kelley Withrow, the executive director for Rosecastle at Deerwood, in a statement.

""We are happy to report that Mary is off to a great start in her new role, and we are excited to see the positive changes in Steve's demeanor as well.""

Daniel said that she understands why the rules are in place and she appreciates the hard work everyone is putting in, but she thinks there has to be a better way.

She's urged the state and Gov. DeSantis to adjust the restrictions and has started a Facebook group with other families to try to find other options.

""It's incredibly sad to see that these patients are significantly declining because they are isolated,"" she said. ""We are isolating these patients to save them, but the isolation is killing them.""",[],597,0.9428191724464661

When coronavirus first hit in March, the freelance production manager paid about $30 for a three-month premium subscription on the dating app Hinge -- and he figured he'd just keep swiping until that ended.

Like many, the 29-year-old used dating apps like Hinge as a way to connect with others, especially since making in-person connections had become nearly impossible with COVID-19 shutdowns. He went on one Facetime date -- the girl, he said, seemed like she was ""just going through her matches ... like on a spreadsheet.""

But on May 29, he had plans to meet up with a different match -- this time in person. A 28-year-old nurse named Brooke, with whom he would hike Runyon Canyon -- Los Angeles' picturesque, influencer-ridden trail.

It was in the middle of their approximately three-mile hike, when the two decided they felt comfortable enough to remove their face masks, that he knew this was different. Their guards were down, or as he described it, ""all caution (regarding coronavirus) was thrown to the wind.""

Now, less than one month and many dates later, they split most of their time between his West Hollywood apartment and hers in Long Beach. He's done what many initially considered impossible with social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders:

He found love during a global pandemic.

""This is truly two people finding their soulmate during the most unlikely of times,"" he told CNN in a phone interview. ""We're thinking about eloping to Vegas if the chapels open.""

While this may sound extreme, many formerly single people -- and dating experts -- say the pandemic has actually helped people find their matches more easily.

""I think people are more likely to find love during this time than not during this time,"" Yue Xu, co-host of the popular ""Dateable"" podcast, told CNN in a video call.

""Because we have this dedicated time to find love, there are no distractions -- you're not a bar looking at people around you or looking at your drink. Everyone's more present and they are more conscious about the way they are showing up to these virtual or real-life dates.""

Xu and podcast co-host Julie Krafchick, who are based in San Francisco, said they've noticed an overall change for the better in terms of the dating landscape over the past few months.

""Consider this a reset,"" Xu said. ""Even though we're losing magic of that first date -- the first kiss, first touch -- we're forced to think about how we can reinvent dating.""

The 'fail fast mentality'

Dating has never been -- and never will be -- perfect. Before the pandemic, Xu and Krafchick answered questions on their podcast such as ""Do Millennials even want to find love?"" and ""Is monogamy dead?""

""We can't have amnesia that dating wasn't perfect before,"" Krafchick said. ""Part of the reason we created the podcast in the first place was to answer the question, 'What the f**k is wrong with modern dating?'""

The biggest challenge for the singles out there before the pandemic, Krafchick said, was that many spent a lot of time in relationship limbo.

""No one wanted to say they were excited about someone,"" she said. ""No one wanted to define the relationship.""

Now, however, the pandemic has led to what Krafchick described as the ""fail fast mentality.""

""People are starting to feel it's better to fail fast than be in this constant state of equilibrium,"" she said. ""Like, let's either get it off the ground or end it.""

The podcast hosts have heard countless stories during these past few months of people who have successfully found love, and people who have felt more encouraged by their dating experiences even if their quarantine relationships didn't work out.

""Coming out of quarantine, everyone has a really strong feeling of a yes or no,"" Xu said.

Many have also taken this time in quarantine to self reflect, which has helped pave the way to finding healthier relationships.

""I think this time has given people a lot of clarity into what they want in life,"" Krafchick said. ""It's shown life is short and at the end of the day, relationships are what matters most. A lot of people have used this time to do self work, especially in the dark middle period of quarantine, where it didn't feel like there was any way to meet someone.""

Virtual dates have also made people throw their old notions of dating out of the window, as they are forced to get creative. For example, ""there are 'Zootie' calls now,"" Xu explained. ""Zoom booty calls.""

'A whole other dimension of consent'

With this uncharted era of dating also comes new conversations around consent: Do you feel safe meeting in person during a pandemic? Do you agree to wearing masks on the first date? Do you feel comfortable being less than 6 feet apart?

Jessica Gerhardt, a Santa Monica, California, native, and her new partner -- they have not labeled the relationship yet -- waited three months before they decided to meet in person for the first time last week.

""He's way more conscientious than me,"" the musician said of the new guy in her life, who is also a musician.

The two, who had mutual friends in the music scene, began talking after he ""slid into her DMs"" on Instagram. Before they met up, he researched and looked into data about social distancing, Gerhardt said.

""We both consented to hug when we first met,"" the 30-year-old told CNN. ""There's a whole other dimension of consent during this pandemic. Under normal circumstances, of course I'd want to hug -- but it was helpful to have that conversation before and nice to know if we don't do something it's not necessarily a sign of 'Oh, I'm not attracted or interested, but I'm trying to be considerate of your safety and vice versa.'""

The lack of touching before meeting, Gerhardt said, made her feel like the two were cultivating ""deeper intimacy"" as they got to know each other.

They ended up going on a social distance walk in her neighborhood while both wore face masks. At the end of their walking date, he asked whether he could use her bathroom before he drove home.

""He came inside, and we both took off our masks after I asked, 'Do you feel comfortable being maskless?' and he said, 'I feel comfortable.' It was a nice surprise,"" she said. ""We ended up feeling comfortable enough to also hold hands and cuddle. It was really sweet.""

While they do not have plans to move in together any time soon, Gerhardt said he has now joined her quarantine pod, which includes her roommate and her roommate's boyfriend.

Learning each other's values early on

On top of the pandemic, these past few months have seen nationwide protests demanding justice and an end to police brutality in the aftermath of the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks.

How people have acted during this time has helped provide a window into their beliefs, which for some singles has helped narrow down their pool of potential matches.

For example, on dating apps, many have said they have encountered photos of people holding ""Black Lives Matter"" signs at protests on their profiles. Others said they've seen people sporting face masks in their pictures, to highlight the fact that they are following social distancing guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in order to curb the spread of the virus.

""With the Black Lives Matter movement, COVID, and everything else that's been going on, it's been causing people to have way deeper conversations,"" Krafchick said. ""You can really quickly realize who has same values as you and who would be a better long-term partner. (Talking about) those things can really help you understand someone a lot better on a deeper level and get you past those basic dating questions.""

Liz Dwyer, who lives in LA, fell for a guy named Demis Courquet-Lesaulnier, who she has been messaging on Instagram since before the pandemic. He lives in Paris, and they had plans -- pre-coronavirus -- to meet abroad. Now, that plan has been put on hold.

But that hasn't slowed their relationship down at all. In fact, it's sped things up. Dwyer said she's gotten closer to her now-boyfriend these past few months virtually, thanks to many of the current events they discuss.

""We have completely different cultural backgrounds,"" the writer and editor told CNN. ""I'm American, he's French. I'm Black, he's White. We had to get to know each other -- not just on the 'I think you're good looking' and 'you're cute too' conversation.""

Dwyer said Demis created a list of 54 films -- including ""BlacKkKlansman,"" ""13th"" and ""When They See Us"" -- ""to try and understand what it's like to be Black in America."" The two have conversations about them, and discuss what he noticed, observed and learned from them. He even wrote a post titled ""A Love Letter to Black America"" to reflect on his takeaways.

""He was open to understanding what was happening in terms of racism,"" she said.

Without the pandemic, she doesn't know what their relationship would look like today.

""I don't know what the future holds,"" she added, ""but no matter what, the experience has changed me for the better.""

Finding your 'apocalypse partner'

Ronni Morgan, 32, and her partner Adriane (AJ) Johnson, 41, met on the HER app -- a dating app for queer people -- on March 23.

They started by texting, having FaceTime dates and watching Netflix together virtually, with Morgan in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Johnson in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

When they finally reached a point where they felt safe enough to start planning an in-person meeting, they found an AirBnB in between their two locations that they considered secluded and off-the-beaten path.

From the beginning, Morgan said, the two were ""on the same page about how to handle the pandemic.""

""We have both taken it very seriously,"" Morgan told CNN. ""I don't think we would've made it this far otherwise.""

When they finally did meet, on June 26, Morgan said their weekend together ""legitimately was like a lesbian romance novel, complete with a fireplace, velvety red blanket and epic thunderstorm.""

""When we did finally get to meet in person, we were already so deeply connected there was no question of what the chemistry would be like,"" she told CNN.

Their relationship is still a long-distance one -- but Morgan said there's no doubt in her mind that she's found her ""apocalypse partner,"" aka the person to ride out the pandemic with.

""There's this meme that talks about how dating in 2020 is about choosing your apocalypse partner wisely and honestly I couldn't agree more,"" Morgan said. ""I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, there's no one I'd rather be braving the new world with than AJ.""

The two have created a Facebook page and Instagram page dedicated to their love story.

""I never imagined I'd meet the love of my life during a global pandemic but here we are,"" Morgan wrote in a post sharing their story on Facebook.

""Anything is possible.""

Meeting at the virtual bar

Back in March, Krafchick and Xu decided to bring their community of listeners together in a Facebook group they called ""Love in the Time of Corona by the Dateable Podcast."" They said they felt it was important for people to feel less alone as quarantine began.

So far, the group has amassed more than 500 members -- who all actively utilize the group to share their experiences with dating in comments, over virtual happy hours, and, sometimes even with the two hosts as guests on their show.

Thursday afternoon, a ""Dateable""-hosted virtual happy hour was in full swing, with about 20 people from across the United States -- some returning faces, others new to the hangout -- hopping on a video chat on Facebook.

Group members could check out different Facebook rooms, including: ""The Bar,"" where Krafchick and Xu kicked off the afternoon with intros. Then, some stayed behind to play a game of ""Would You Rather?"" with dating-themed questions.

""Would you rather date someone who is in a lot of debt but donates to charity on a regular basis,"" Xu asked the group, ""or someone who has no debt, but doesn't donate to charities?""

Others joined the ""Playtime"" room, where they participated in dating-themed trivia. And some joined a new ""room"" called the ""Dance Floor,"" where one member taught a dance class.",[],2049,0.8873419201983871

The first was in 1918, during the Spanish flu when Stallworthy was just three years old. The second, today, when she turned 105 during Covid-19.

She admits she doesn't remember much about her first pandemic birthday, but this was one she will never forget.

Dozens of people gathered down the street from the Kingston Road home where Stallworthy has lived for more than half a century, and then, on foot, paraded past her house to offer their best wishes. Sitting on her front porch, Stallworthy watched as person after person came to pay their respects from a safe social distance.

""It's just tremendous,"" Stallworthy told CTV News, ""I'm absolutely blown away.""

Stallworthy was born on July 12, 1915, in London, England. Before moving to Canada in 1951, she'd already lived through two world wars and the great depression. One of the first things she did upon settling in Toronto, was to join the congregation of Kingston Road United Church. ""I've been working my bottom off ever since,"" Stallworthy said with a laugh. To this day, she remains active in the church.

And it's her faith that she credits with getting her to 105, an age she admits she never thought she'd reach. When asked for the secret to her longevity, Stallworthy replies, ""I think it's my belief in good old God.""

Sunday's birthday parade was organized by her fellow parishioners. Granddaughter Sheri Gardiner told CTV News, ""she just loves people, and I think it's pretty obvious today that people love her too​.""

Finding a way to safely celebrate a 105th birthday during Covid-19 can be a challenge.

""I feel as if I'm living my life in a bubble,"" Stallworthy said.

The normally active and social centenarian says she's been trying to stay social but at a safe distance from those who visit. And she says while she heard stories about the 1918 pandemic from her mother, Covid-19 gives her pause. ""Well this one is so different, I'm not sure how we're going to come out of it.""

Stallworthy has been married twice, and along with remaining active in her church, she's a lifetime member of the Girl Guides and speaks to students about her experiences during the war each Remembrance Day.

Those at her birthday celebration marvelled at how active she remains at her age. Stallworthy says with a smile, ""life has to be lived. And you have to get up in the morning and say 'thank God I'm alive,' even though it hurts a little everywhere.""

As for what she might do to celebrate her 106th birthday next year, Stallworthy thinks for a second, and then says she'd like to fly to British Colombia, to visit family- including a new great-grandson she has yet to meet.

But for this birthday, Stallworthy sat back, and blew kisses from her porch- celebrating a milestone most will never achieve, and looking back at a life most could never imagine.

""It's been an incredible journey, and I feel that I'm the luckiest woman in the world to have gone through it.""",[],515,0.9573952715873228

Ready to return to Vancouver after two years in China, Robertson and her husband ran into hurdle after hurdle trying to book a plane ticket for their rescue terrier mix as the coronavirus pandemic was taking hold of the world -- shutting cities and airports down.

Soon they'd realize they were far from alone in their efforts to get their dog on a plane. Five hundred people joined a WeChat group the two created -- initially meant as a tool to gather ideas and information on transporting pets.

Other owners were mostly from cities throughout Canada and the U.S. Many had left China hurriedly months ago to see friends or family, thinking they'd be back with their furry roommates in days. But then coronavirus hit and hundreds of travelers were stranded, while their pets remained in the care of either boarding facilities or acquaintances.

Soon, an idea emerged: They'd charter a plane from Shanghai to fly their dogs and cats home, which would touch down in Vancouver, then Seattle. That plane will also help reunite families by bringing back Americans or Canadians stuck in China.

They're calling the effort ""Mission Impawsible.""

'CAN WE EVEN PULL OFF SOMETHING LIKE THIS?'

Arranging the flight was no easy task. Dozens of group members -- from China, the U.S. and Canada -- collaborated on different parts of the plan often with more than half a day's hour difference between them. Nights were long and sleepless.

Many, like dog owner Catherine Hildreth, tasked themselves with learning how to edit videos and design T-shirts, in order to help the group raise awareness of their efforts and fundraise.

The group shared details of the flight on social media and messaging apps and began selling tickets to other Canadian or American citizens hoping for a flight back to their families, after meeting with each consulate. And they enlisted some of those passengers to accompany each dog and cat on the flight.

""It's been a whirlwind and definitely never in my wildest dreams did I think that creating a WeChat group was going to lead me here six weeks later,"" Robertson told CNN. ""Chartering a flight across the ocean for my dog.""

And finally, the group secured a flight for July 18. One hundred furry passengers are booked.

The journey has been a ray of light amid dark times, some group members say, a reminder of what strong collaboration can look like when everyone feels so isolated.

""It's just been kind of one of those things where we've been like, .... at first, 'Whoa, can we even pull off something like this?'"" Robertson said. ""We don't even know each other, we haven't even met in person, we're from different places.

""If you kind of just put your mind to it and just work really hard... you can make this happen,"" she said. ""I think that's what's been amazing for me.""

A COMPANION ON HIS WAY

One of the people waiting for her dog on the other side of the ocean is Kaitlyn Hooper, who now lives in Ontario after a string of devastating news she had to endure without her best friend.

One of the last moments she recalls spending with her rescue, Ted, was the dog's long licks on her face, shortly before a phone call let her know her dad had passed away.

Hooper, who until December taught at a Canadian international school, flew back with return tickets scheduled in three weeks' time. But then another piece of news hit: her mom was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer and passed away shortly after.

""The world was just in a dark place,"" she said. ""So I started looking for ways to get my dog home.""

She tried working with an agent and once she gathered the money to get Ted on a plane, the flight was no longer operating. So when a friend passed along information of the charter flight that would get pets to their owners, she started paying attention. But having no one to accompany her dog on the flight, as required, she shared her story with the group in hopes of a volunteer to accompany him.

That volunteer was Robertson, who along with her husband and their one dog, signed up to be Ted's plus one.

""I've never met Kyla and she's willing to accompany my dog on a 12-hour flight. And that's amazing,"" Hooper said. ""When the world has been so dark for the last few months, it's really added a lot of light in the last few days.""

And it's brought light to the past few weeks as well, she says, seeing a group of strangers form their own determined committee to bring their pets back home. The long nights and endless communications, she says, have been worth it.

""It's hard to get out of bed in the morning and having a dog, it makes you get up, go outside, get some fresh air,"" she says. ""And I think that mental health benefit of having a pet outweighs any costs or frustrations or 3 a.m. text message exchange trying to coordinate all aspects of the flight.""

ANOTHER 20-HOUR DRIVE HOME

In North Carolina, Hildreth has busied herself creating videos and designing T-shirts for the cause -- and counting down the days until she's reunited with her ""fur baby.""

Hildreth and her husband, who both worked for the U.S. Army, rescued their German short-haired pointer in 2015. She says the dog looked so sad, she instead decided to name him -- fittingly -- Happy. The two planned a four-day trip in January to the U.S. from China to begin coordinating for a hopeful move here over the summer.

But the trip, amid a spreading virus, turned into a permanent change.

She is now coordinating efforts to bring dogs to the East Coast once the charter flight lands in Seattle -- about a 2,000-mile journey from North Carolina. During a global pandemic when more families across the world were separated or remain stranded, the group's efforts have given her hope.

""Every night, I stayed up to talk to people in China,"" she said. ""Can you imagine? Those people back in China stayed up all night to talk to Canada and to talk to everybody to try to figure these things out.""

While her friends in China suggested she give her dog to another family, it wasn't an option for her.

""He's my family. I cannot give up on him. I've got to do anything I can to bring him home,"" she said.

""So it is a Mission Impawsible,"" she said. ""Right now, the people who love their pets is the main focus.""",[],1089,0.9492710609196561

Health Canada announced May 16 that it had approved Ad5-nCoV for human trials in Canada, to be carried out by the Canadian Center for Vaccinology (CCV) at Dalhousie University in Halifax.

Human trials of the vaccine candidate are further along in China, with results promising enough that the Chinese government has approved it for use in its military.

Dr. Scott Halperin, the CCV's director, said in May that the tests would be carried out ""in a more accelerated fashion"" than the usual process, which can take five years or more. He told The Canadian Press that he expected the first phase of the trial to get underway within about three weeks.

Nearly two months later, though, not a single Canadian has been given Ad5-nCoV – because, as was first reported by iPolitics, not a single shipment of the vaccine candidate has arrived in the country.

A spokesman for Health Canada told CTVNews.ca on Monday that Chinese authorities have yet to sign off on sending the potential vaccine here.

""The vaccine candidate for Phase 1 clinical trials has not yet been approved by Chinese customs for shipment to Canada,"" Andre Gagnon said in a statement.

""Once the Canadian Center for Vaccinology receives the vaccine candidate it will start the clinical trial for CanSino, under the regulatory supervision of Health Canada.""

CanSino Biologics, the biopharmaceutical company that developed the Ad5-nCoV along with Chinese government scientists, did not respond to a request for comment before this story was published.

In a statement to CTVNews.ca, a spokesman for Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains described Ad5-nCoV as ""one of the leading candidate vaccines against COVID-19 in the world"" and said an arrangement is in place that will allow it to be manufactured in Canada ""for emergency pandemic use"" if it is approved for distribution by Health Canada.

The government announced in May that it was planning a $44-million upgrade to a National Research Council of Canada facility in Montreal to prepare for the possibility of a large-scale Ad5-nCoV manufacturing effort.",[],358,0.9735425448328432

There have been several well-documented cases of female COVID-19 patients giving birth while positive for the disease. Doctors were even able to deliver a baby boy in Colombia last month 14 weeks early, after the mother slipped into a coma.

Researchers have also found evidence of the novel coronavirus in at-term placenta, an umbilical cord and breast milk of infected mothers.

However, there had been no known examples of a baby born to a COVID-19-positive mother also testing positive for the disease – not until Friday, when researchers affiliated with the University of Texas published their findings in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal.

In this case, the baby was born prematurely, at 34 weeks. Because of that and because of the possible exposure to COVID-19 through her 37-year-old mother, she was placed in a neonatal intensive care unit for observation.

Although all her vital signs were normal on the day of her birth, the researchers say, she developed a fever and some mild breathing difficulty the following day. A test administered 24 hours after her birth came up positive for SARS-CoV-2, as did a second test 24 hours later.

Further tests of the placenta revealed the presence of coronavirus particles and a protein that is believed to be specific to the virus. Because of these results, the researchers concluded that COVID-19 was passed on to the baby in the womb, not during or after her birth.

The researchers say this sort of transmission ""appears to be a rare event"" given that no other documented cases of it have come to light.

The baby was given supplemental oxygen for a few days and continued to test positive through her first two weeks of life. Three weeks after she was born, she and her mother were sent home, and both are said to be in good condition.",[],333,0.9373238944830026

What PM Trudeau's COVID-19 messaging reveals,'Rachel Aiello',2020-07-13 07:15:00-04:00,"OTTAWA -- It became a scene most Canadians could recognize: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emerges from Rideau Cottage and descends six steps to a podium, notes in hand. This was how the prime minister chose to speak to the country, day in and day out between March and July. In his morning updates, COVID-19 aid packages amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars were unveiled and public health advisories were driven home, but what else did Trudeau have to say?

CTVNews.ca has analyzed the 81 national addresses and following media availabilities that Trudeau held during the 110 days between entering a 14-day self-isolation, on March 12, to his June 29 announcement that, going forward, he would only convene the Rideau Cottage updates when he had big news to share.

The day after Trudeau entered quarantine on account of his wife Sophie having symptoms that were soon confirmed to be from COVID-19, the prime minister began what quickly became a daily routine: addressing the nation from Rideau Cottage, his family’s temporary home on the grounds of Rideau Hall.

Those morning addresses, mostly from the grounds of Rideau Hall, became a seven-day-a-week ritual, with few days off in the first two months. Then, as the public health crisis entered into the initial phase of reopenings, the routine was eased, with no press conferences on weekends and eventually only a few times a week.

Analyzing the transcripts of his English-language remarks from all those Rideau Cottage updates, as well as the few offsite, CTVNews.ca identified his commonly used phrases and terms, as well as his go-to nouns and adjectives, before asking political communication experts and a linguist to assess the words he was using to deliver his messages, and whether they were effective.

WHAT WORDS DID HE USE?

CTVNews.ca’s analysis found that the most repeated phrase was “right across the country,” followed by variations of “keep Canadians safe.” Others that topped the list included “make sure,” and “move forward.”

Speaking to the use of “keep Canadians safe,” former lead speechwriter for Trudeau, Jeni Armstrong, said she thinks it was a great choice.

“It's simple, it's direct, it appeals to the kind of worries that we all have about our families… It’s memorable and like I said, it is the kind of reassurance that I think people were seeking especially in the early days,” said Armstrong, who is now an instructor with the Clayton H. Riddell Graduate Program in Political Management at Carleton University after working as the director of communications for Finance Minister Bill Morneau and helping to author the Liberal Party’s 2019 and 2015 federal election platforms.

Other phrases that appeared often included: “long-term care”; “continue to work”; “public health”; “social distancing”; “people need”; “staying home”; and “coming weeks.”

CTVNews.ca also searched for the frequency of other key words, which may not necessarily be the words said the most. The word “recognize” came up 183 times over the 81 addresses, “virus” was said 127 times, “parliament” got named 108 times and “unprecedented” was said 63 times. Further, “racism” was said 53 times, “China” was found in the transcripts 45 times, and “budget” just nine times.

Armstrong said Trudeau has a personal verbal habit where he builds formulas for responding to questions, which could explain the frequency of the word “recognize”—which often was how he started an answer to reporters’ questions: “we recognize…”

“He'll often say—and this has been true for a number of years… ‘Canadians expect us to ABC, and we are doing just that.’ It's kind of a formula that he has,” she said.

Trudeau’s go-to verbs, in order of frequency: “need”; “get”; “make”; “continue”’ “know”; “keep”; “ensure”; “want”; “think”; and “help.”

As for adjectives, he most often said: “many”; “sure”; “safe”; “able”; “right”; “important”; “different”; “new”; “Canadian”; and “possible.”

Linguist Shana Poplack told CTVNews.ca that Trudeau’s word choices show he wants to evoke he is in charge and has things under control.

“If this is the message he's trying to relay, those words are consistent,” said Poplack, who is the director of the Sociolinguistics Laboratory at the University of Ottawa and Canada Research Chair in Linguistics.

Poplack also said what stood out to her were the phrases that didn’t crack the top of the list of things Trudeau said, despite them being so frequently said in society writ large these days, including “in these uncertain times,” and “the new normal.”

“That does not tie in with the message that he's trying to get across,” she said, suggesting it’s possible he didn’t want to highlight the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“That's why we see “ensure,” we see the word “safe,” reappearing... He also has to convince us that he's on top of it,” she said.

BUILT UP LEXICON OF PHRASES

What the frequent repetition of these and other phrases indicates, experts said, is that Trudeau and his relatively small team of speechwriters had developed a dictionary of key phrases to reinforce and repeat in his prepared remarks. The messaging was first built into his speeches, but after their near-daily repeating, they became a reflexive part of his vocabulary when responding to questions, too.

Poplack said these are referred to as “fixed expressions,” some of which are commonly used by all, others are created, as seen with terms for aid programs to establish a clear message. The use of such phrases can be seen across political lines and in past prime ministers’ speaking habits as well.

“For Paul Martin it was ‘let me be clear,’ for Stephen Harper it was ‘obviously’,” said Garry Keller, vice president at StrategyCorp and a past adviser to former prime minister Stephen Harper.

Armstrong said the repetition of the COVID-19 benefit-specific phrases also helped to build up familiarity with new programs. “Emergency Response Benefit” — referring to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit of $2,000 a month to out of wok Canadians — was in the top-five most said three-word phrases, and “wage subsidy” was in the top five two-word phrases spoken.

“What he's attempting to do there is to get people familiar with the name of any program… When you're working on that, repetition is your friend,” she said.

STRUCTURE SUITS THE PM

Strategic communication professional and political commentator Scott Reid said that the formula of “political communication by dint of news conference” has become a go-to form of communicating COVID-19 crisis updates around the world and across Canada, where provincial premiers have all taken a similar approach.

The format plays to Trudeau’s strengths, Reid said, contrasting the PM’s comfort and skill delivering on-message remarks without relying on rote responses to the communication approach of other world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, who Reid said failed at being consistent in his messaging and shut down his routine of regular press conferences long before Trudeau did.

“A crisis such as this, which has created a made-for-television daily news conference, it's almost perfectly built for his [Trudeau’s] talent set and instincts because he has a preternatural sense of self… He's extraordinarily conscious of his presentation and of his representation to the public, and that serves him extremely well in this situation,” said Reid, who also worked as an adviser to former prime minister Paul Martin.

Keller noted that opting to keep Trudeau’s addresses to the high-level details and letting a cadre of ministers follow after him to take reporters’ more detailed questions also meant that Trudeau was usually out of the spotlight by midday, rather than facing reporters and opposition MPs multiple throughout the entire day.

“It quite frankly has worked for them,” said Keller, adding that all of the opposition parties found it challenging to compete with.

BOOST TO APPROVAL RATING

The more frequent prime ministerial appearances also had positive returns on his approval ratings, according to CTV News’ pollster and Chair of Nanos Research, Nik Nanos.

“What I'll call the ‘relentless chain of press conferences’ … they've effectively done a bit of a reset on his brand,” Nanos said. “There's been a complete reset on Justin Trudeau’s personal brand. His brand is now strong again— it's not as strong as the honeymoon [phase]— but it's strong and the Liberal numbers are strong.”

Nanos Research asks Canadians weekly whether they feel the various federal party leaders have the qualities of a good political leader, and Trudeau’s trend line shows that Canadians surveyed are viewing him more positively since March than they have in the entirety of the last four years.

KEY MOMENTS LIKE 'SPEAKING MOISTLY'

These routine speeches also provided several key moments over the initial four months of the COVID-19 pandemic, from Trudeau’s infamous “speaking moistly” slip-up when describing how the coronavirus can transmit through droplets, to his conspicuously long pause when asked about Trump's handling of anti-racism protesters in the United States.

While the combination of “speaking” and “moistly” was swiftly removed from Trudeau’s lexicon, Armstrong said even when such moments inspire mockery, they are generally well-received.

“That ended up being really funny at a time when people needed to laugh right? And he's, he's very much able to laugh at himself in moments like that,” she said of Trudeau. She cited the first time that he spoke directly to children as another notable moment.

“Kids are an overlooked constituency… They're not even spoken to directly by people in power very often. But they are feeling and experiencing this moment, in a very, very profound way, and I as a mom, and as a citizen, and as a communicator, I really love that he acknowledged that,” she said.

WHY THE ADDRESSES ENDED

By the time Trudeau said he’d be cutting down his regular press conferences, the announcements he was making had already become incremental and small, while the questions he faced were predominately about non-COVID-19 news.

The political communication experts CTVNews.ca spoke with largely agreed that, while the near-daily addresses were key in reassuring Canadians that the federal government was on top of the rapidly unfolding crisis early on, continuing to come out and face reporters was having diminishing positive returns for the prime minister as other big news stories began to bubble up, notably the ongoing WE Charity controversy.

Another reason some suggest could explain why Trudeau’s team opted to wind down what some critics call “the morning show”? Canadians had begun tuning them out.

“I think that they've rightly recognized that should there be a second wave, should there be a need to start communicating again on a daily basis in a way that was happening in March for example, they don't want to kind of burn the goodwill and the listening potential of the audience by continuing to speak every day if there's not something new to share,” said Kate Harrison, vice president at Summa Strategies Canada and Conservative political commentator.

WILL SEE THIS FORMAT AGAIN

Going forward, the experts interviewed said to expect the format to resume should there be a new resurgence in the virus’ spread.

Reid said that if there is a second wave of COVID-19 infections, the public and the media has come to expect the prime minister will be front-and-centre.

“This is now how it is done. It has quietly become a matter of consensus among political leaders, media, public audiences, that this is how this gets prosecuted, and so it will recur, and it will overwhelmingly benefit political leaders who are capable of commanding the podium and follow those very simple rules of being thematic, being consistent, demonstrating empathy,” Reid said.

Methodology: For this project we used the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python to run a word frequency and N-gram analysis on the transcripts. An N-gram analysis counts the occurrences of two or more words together. The code stripped the transcripts to leave only those words spoken by Trudeau in English.

Florida health officials reported Sunday a staggering record of new cases in a single day: 15,300. If Florida were a country, it would be the fourth highest in the world in reporting new cases. The state would rank 10th in the list of nations with the most cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University data.

The state added at least 12,343 cases since Sunday, according to the Florida Department of Health.

At least 35 states are seeing a rise in new cases compared to the previous week, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

The U.S. has recorded more than 3.3 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, meaning nearly 1 out of every 100 Americans has tested positive for COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins University. At least 135,379 Americans have died.

Across the world, 12.9 million people have tested positive for the virus.

Both local and state leaders in the U.S. have said in recent weeks new cases are largely driven by Americans who have opted to resume gatherings and outings to bars. In many states, the average age of new cases has shifted downward, with more young people testing positive than ever before since the start of the pandemic.

The rising U.S. numbers could just be the tip of the iceberg, as experts have often highlighted infections could be around 10 times higher than what is reported, as many go untraced.

To blunt the rise in case, at least 36 states now have some type of mask requirement order in place, and more than half of U.S. states have paused or rolled back their reopening plans in efforts to contain the spread of the virus.

But precautions have been met with heavy backlash from many officials and residents and some governors have stayed away from statewide mask orders, including Florida.

PEOPLE NEED TO 'FOLLOW THE RULES'

Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said on CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday that the numbers are ""out of control.""

Americans need to follow the rules on social distancing and wearing masks, which are required for citizens in public in the city of Miami, the mayor said.

""If they don't follow the rules, things are going to continue the way they are going,"" he said.

In Atlanta, where the mayor attempted to require citizens to wear masks and revert the city back to its first phase of reopening to combat a rise in cases, Gov. Brian Kemp slammed the decision saying it was ""both non-binding and legally unenforceable.""

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said on CNN that Kemp had not criticized other cities in Georgia for issuing mask mandates.

""I think that it's unfortunate that when we know the science says wearing a mask is one of the easiest ways to stop the spread, that we had the leader to our state taking exception with it,"" she said.

Miami's Suarez said officials need to have a consistent message at the local, state and national levels.

""A lot of the decisions have been pushed down to local officials that probably should have been done at the federal and state levels,"" he said.

""There's a total disconnect between what is happening and being said out of Washington and even Tallahassee and what is happening in some of these communities right here,"" Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said.

U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said the country could turn the rise of cases around in ""two (to) three weeks."" But that is based on whether ""we can get a critical mass of people wearing face coverings, practicing at least 6 feet of social distancing, doing the things we know are effective,"" Adams said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

The surge in cases comes as the White House is making a concerted effort to discredit Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, as he becomes increasingly vocal about his concerns over reopening the country during the national surge in coronavirus cases.

The moves to undercut Fauci come just days after he gave an unvarnished look at his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, including that they have not spoken in weeks.

During a webinar with the Stanford School of Medicine, Fauci said the pandemic is ""clearly the most challenging"" public health crisis he's ever dealt with, including HIV, the Ebola virus, anthrax and Zika virus.

""We haven't even begun to see the end of it yet,"" Fauci said of the novel coronavirus.

'THIS THING IS JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE'

Across the country, health officials are sounding the alarm over the number of infected patients seeking medical care.

In Florida, 8,038 patients are hospitalized across the state with the primary diagnosis of coronavirus as of Monday morning, according to numbers released by the state's Agency for Health Care Administration. At the peak of the pandemic in New York, the highest number of hospitalizations for COVID-19 was 18,825.

Florida's three most populous counties, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, are experiencing the highest numbers of coronavirus-related hospitalizations.

In Broward County, home to Fort Lauderdale, there was a 279% increase in hospitalizations overnight, the agency reported.

In the past 13 days, Miami-Dade County has seen a 65% increase in the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized, a 67% increase in the number of ICU beds being used and a staggering 129% increase in the use of ventilators, according to the latest data released by Miami-Dade County government.

Across the state, there are more than 7,500 patients hospitalized with the virus, state data showed Sunday. In Orange County, where Disney World reopened over the weekend, more than 540 patients were in hospitals.

Leah Carpenter, CEO of Memorial Hospital West in Pembroke Pines, a community in Broward County, said the hospital has canceled all elective procedures and converted those surgical spaces into temporary ICUs.

""Basically, we're creating space in every inch of the building as needed,"" she said.

In Los Angeles County, health officials reported more than 3,300 new cases Sunday -- the second highest daily case count in the last week. There are nearly 2,100 people hospitalized, a number ""substantially higher"" than hospitalizations a month ago, officials said.

Texas reported 8,136 new cases, down from the record 10,351 new cases reported on Saturday. County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the executive overseeing Harris County, the largest in Texas, called on Sunday for a stay-at-home order to be issued.

""Not only do we need a stay home order now, but we need to stick with it this time until the hospitalization curve comes down, not just flattens,"" Hidalgo tweeted. ""Many communities that persevered in that way are reopening for the long haul. Let's learn from that & not make the same mistake twice.""

And in Arizona, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego told CNN that health care professionals are reporting they are ""already tired"" and worried about additional strains on hospitals stemming from the July 4 holiday, even as the city is already seeing record-breaking ventilator usage.

In Arizona, 89% of ICU beds are currently in use and 86% of all hospital beds in use, according to the Arizona Department of Health Services. Dr. Ross Goldberg, president of Arizona Medical Association, said the longer length of stay by COVID-19 patients is putting pressure on hospitals.

""Here it's a much longer kind of hospital stay, which takes that bed out of circulation,"" he told CNN. ""So if you get people coming in and coming, it just adds pressure on the system.""

There was a glimmer of good news.

In New York City, the epicenter of the virus in April, there were no confirmed or probable COVID-19 deaths reported Saturday, according to preliminary data from the New York City Health Department.",[],1253,0.7818809658524482

PETERSBURG, FLA. -- With the United States grappling with the worst coronavirus outbreak in the world, Florida hit a grim milestone Sunday, shattering the national record for a state's largest single-day increase in positive cases.

Deaths from the virus have also been rising in the U.S., especially in the South and West, though still well below the heights hit in April, according to a recent Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.

""I really do think we could control this, and it's the human element that is so critical. It should be an effort of our country. We should be pulling together when we're in a crisis, and we're definitely not doing it,"" said University of Florida epidemiologist Dr. Cindy Prins.

Adm. Brett Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, called mask-wearing in public, which has been met with resistance in some U.S. states, ""absolutely essential.""

Giroir, the assistant secretary at the Health and Human Services Department, told ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday that ""if we don't have that, we will not get control of the virus.""

President Donald Trump wore a mask in public for the first time Saturday, something Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday showed he has ""crossed a bridge.""

Pelosi told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that she hopes it means the president ""will change his attitude, which will be helpful in stopping the spread of the coronavirus.""

In hard-hit Houston, Texas, two top Democratic officials called for the nation's fourth-largest city to lock back down as area hospitals strained to accommodate the onslaught of sick patients.

In Florida, where parts of Walt Disney World reopened Saturday, 15,299 people tested positive, for a total of 269,811 cases, and 45 deaths were recorded, according to state Department of Health statistics reported Sunday.

California had the previous record of daily positive cases -- 11,694, set on Wednesday.

The numbers come at the end of a record-breaking week as Florida reported 514 fatalities -- an average of 73 per day. Three weeks ago, the state was averaging 30 deaths per day.

Researchers expect deaths to rise in the U.S. for at least some weeks, but some think the count probably will not go up as dramatically as it did in the spring because of several factors, including increased testing.

The World Health Organization, meanwhile, reported another record increase in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases over a 24-hour period, at over 230,000.

The U.N. health agency said the United States again topped the list among countries, with more than 66,000 cases. The figures don't necessarily account for delays in reporting cases, and are believed to far underestimate actual totals.

Countries in Eastern Europe were among those facing rising waves of new infections, leading to riots in Serbia, mandatory face masks in Croatia and travel bans or quarantines imposed by Hungary.

""We see worrisome signs about an increase in the number of cases in the neighbouring countries, Europe and the whole world,"" said Gergely Gulyas, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of staff. ""Now, we have to protect our own security and prevent the virus from being brought in from abroad.""

Hungarian authorities said Sunday they have sorted countries into three categories -- red, yellow and green -- based on their rates of new coronavirus infections, and will impose restrictions, including entry bans and mandatory quarantines, depending on which country people are arriving from.

Serbia, where health authorities are warning that hospitals are almost full due to the latest surge, reported 287 new infections on Sunday, although there have been increasing doubts about the accuracy of the figures. Officially, the country has over 18,000 confirmed infections and 382 deaths since March. Sunday's report of 11 coronavirus deaths was the country's second-highest daily death toll.

Serbian police clashed with anti-government protesters for four nights last week, demonstrations that forced the Serbian president to withdraw plans to reintroduce a coronavirus lockdown. Many of the increasing infections have been blamed on crowded soccer matches, tennis events and nightclubs.

In Bulgaria, authorities reintroduced restrictions lifted a few weeks ago because of a new surge in cases.

Albania also has seen a significant increase in infections since mid-May, when it eased lockdown measures. The Balkan nation reported 93 new cases, over twice as many as the highest daily figures in March and April, and the health ministry called the situation at the main infectious disease hospital ""grave.""

Croatia, whose island-dotted Adriatic Sea coast is a major tourist destination, is making wearing masks mandatory in stores beginning Monday.

Yet the numbers of infections in Eastern Europe pale in comparison to daily coronavirus reports from India, South Africa and Brazil, whose virus-denying president has tested positive.

India, which has the most cases after the United States and Brazil, saw a record surge of 28,637 cases reported in the past 24 hours. Authorities also announced a weeklong lockdown beginning Tuesday in the key southern technology hub of Bangalore, where the offices of top tech companies like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon are located.

South Africa has reported over 10,000 new daily cases for several days in a row, including 13,497 new infections announced Saturday night. Johannesburg's densely populated Soweto township is one of the virus hot spots. With over 264,000 cases and 3,971 deaths, South Africa accounts for over 40% of all the reported coronavirus cases in Africa.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Sunday the country would return to a ban of alcohol sales to reduce the volume of trauma patients so that hospitals have more beds to treat COVID-19. The country is also reinstating a night curfew to reduce traffic accidents and has made it mandatory for all residents to wear face masks in public.

Meanwhile, in Taiwan, which kept its coronavirus outbreak to a few hundred cases, an annual film festival wrapped up with an awards ceremony this weekend where actors and others lined up for photo shoots with no social distancing, and participants didn't wear masks.

Kimberley Chavez Lopez Byrd, 61, died June 26, less than two weeks after she was hospitalized. The other two teachers -- Jena Martinez and Angela Skillings -- said they're still struggling with the effects of the virus that has killed nearly 135,000 people nationwide.

All three teachers wore masks and gloves, used hand sanitizer and socially distanced, but still got sick, according to school officials at the small community in the eastern part of the state.

Kimberley Byrd had worked at the Hayden Winkelman School District for 38 years -- so long that she'd started teaching the children of her former students.

""Losing Mrs. Byrd in our small rural community was devastating. She was an excellent educator with a huge heart,"" said Pamela Gonzalez, principal of Leonor Hambly K8. ""We find comfort in knowing her story may bring awareness to the importance of keeping our school employees safe and our precious students safe in this pandemic.""

THE INFECTION STARTED IN JUNE

Kimberley Byrd started feeling unwell in June. She was prone to sinus infections, and also had asthma, diabetes and lupus. Her doctor gave her antibiotics and steroids and on June 13, she went to the emergency room, according to her husband, Jesse Byrd Sr.

She was admitted to the hospital and immediately put on oxygen, but her husband was not allowed to be with her. The next morning, she called him to say doctors were putting her on a ventilator. That was the last time they spoke.

""I just had this horrible gut-wrenching feeling just knowing how much of a struggle this was going to be because I knew her lungs were compromised even before this ... fear, just the worst fear that you could feel,"" Byrd said. ""I knew it was going to be rough on her.""

Days later, Jesse Byrd, his daughter, son, daughter-in-law, 4-year-old granddaughter and several other relatives contracted COVID-19. His wife's brother's also tested positive and has been on a ventilator for over 27 days, he told CNN Saturday night.

Jesse Byrd said his wife's condition started improving and the doctors woke her up to see if she could tolerate being intubated while semiconscious. When she woke, she had a panic attack and started regressing.

""We just prayed for a miracle, and we put her in God's hands and we said either he's gonna work a miracle in her and save her or he's gonna take her home,"" Jesse Byrd said. ""She didn't make it ... It's been devastating for us here in our home.""

She died just short of their 24th wedding anniversary.

HUSBAND WARNS ABOUT REOPENING SCHOOLS

Kimberley Byrd loved the outdoors, said Jeff Gregorich, the superintendent of Hayden Winkelman Unifed School District. ""One of my fondest memories was every time I would see her, she would show me [pictures of] her last weekend fishing at the lake,"" he said.

Jesse Byrd said his wife had a passion for teaching and cared for her students. ""A lot of her classroom rules were based around kids respecting each other and being kind to each other and not bullying -- that was really important to her,"" he said.

Gregorich reiterated the three teachers were careful and still got COVID-19.

""I think that's really the message or the concern that our staff has is we can't even keep our staff safe by themselves ... how are we going to keep 20 kids in a classroom safe? I just don't see how that's possible to do that,"" he said.

Byrd said reopening schools will put people in their small community at risk and he does not want to see other families go through a similar experience.

""Many grandparents, wind up being caretakers to kids when they get off school- mom and dad are working and a lot of grandparents are even raising their grandchildren. So, many of these grandparents fall into this high risk category of being older with more health issues,"" he said.

""They have no business opening the schools to try and get back to a traditional classroom ... let's get through this pandemic first before we try to get back to normal.""",[],691,0.9179347332063367

The majority of Ontario's 34 local public health unit regions will move forward to Stage 3 on July 17, the province announced on Monday.

Health units in the Greater Toronto Area, along with a few others like Niagara and Windsor, are not included on the list of regions moving forward to Stage 3. The regions excluded from the list will remain in Stage 2 of the restart phase until further notice.

""We will keep working until every part of this province gets to Stage 3,"" Premier Doug Ford said Monday. ""My friends, this is great news. We are moving forward as a province but we can't stop, we won't stop until we get every worker in Ontario back to work and back on their feet.""

For the regions moving forward to Stage 3, there will be a significant increase to social gathering limits.

Indoor gathering limits will increase from 10 to a maximum of 50 people, while outdoor gathering limits will increase to a maximum of 100 people.

Physical distancing is still required during any gathering with people from outside an individual's social circle. The province is not increasing the number of people a person can gather with without physical distancing measures in place.

The government is also banning a number of high-risk businesses and activities from resuming in Stage 3, including amusement parks, water parks, buffet-style food services, dancing in restaurants and bars, overnight stays at camps for children, private karaoke rooms, prolonged or deliberate contact while playing sports, saunas, steam rooms, bath houses and oxygen bars.

Casinos will be allowed to reopen but table games are banned.

All restaurants, bars, concession stands, and other food and drink establishments are allowed to reopen for indoor dining in Stage 3. Nightclubs are still banned from reopening, except for the purpose of serving food or drinks.

Gyms and fitness studios can also reopen with safety protocols in place. Organized sports can also resume, with the exception of contact sports.

Playgrounds, community centres and libraries will also reopen.

The province will also allow personal support services to resume that involve a customers' face, such as facials and some piercings.

""All other businesses and public spaces will be permitted to be open, subject to ensuring the appropriate health and safety measures are in place, as well as limits on gathering sizes,"" the government said.

The government said that as more businesses and activities reopen, COVID-19 trends will be monitored closely and restrictions can be “further loosened, or if they need to be tightened.”

People are still being asked to work remotely ""as much as possible,"" the government said.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said that Ontario will remain in Stage 3 for the ""foreseeable future.""

""Certainly we are all hoping there will be a vaccine in short order but apart from that we will remain in Stage 3,"" she said. ""But depending on how Stage 3 moves forward in different parts of the province, if we keep our numbers down, if there are no new outbreaks of COVID-19, then we will be able to gradually expand things like the size of gatherings for example.""

""That will be a gradual loosening of the health restrictions, still within Stage 3.""

Ontario also extended the province's state of emergency on Monday until July 24.

When will the Toronto area move to Stage 3?

Elliott said that the province needs more COVID-19 data from the regions who are not heading into Stage 3 before a decision can be made about moving forward.

""There are several other communities that moved into Stage 2 before Toronto did. We expect that will happen in the same way because the chief medical officer of health and the public health experts need to see about four weeks of data to understand what is going on locally, to make sure there are no further public health concerns,"" Elliott said.

""We expect that the next group will be the second group that moved to Stage 2 will be the second group to move to Stage 3 just because of the time frames that have elapsed and then Toronto will follow.""

Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams, said he hopes all regions will enter Stage 3 by the end of July.

Dr. Brent Roussin, the province's chief public health officer, made the announcement Monday afternoon.

Manitoba has had 325 cases since early March. There is currently one active case in Manitoba, and 317 people have recovered from the virus.

The death toll remains at seven.

On Friday, 798 tests were performed. An additional 1,149 tests were completed on Saturday, followed by another 573 on Sunday. The province's total number of tests is now at 71,559 since early February.

As the province continues to see favourable numbers, Roussin said Manitobans can't let their guards down, and now is not the time to relax on health guidelines, such as physical distancing and consistent hand washing.

""This virus is not done with us and if we don't remain vigilant, we'll be seeing increasing cases. So we need to adhere to the principles that got us here,"" said Roussin.

""If we want to keep our success going forward, if we want to keep reopening our economy, we need to start getting back to the basics that got us here.""

Roussin added Manitoba can't loosen restrictions too quickly and people should look at other jurisdictions when restrictions were lifted too early.

""The last thing we want to do is go backwards, we move so quick, and we end up having to put restrictions on again,"" he said.

RESPIRATORY VIRUS STEERING COMMITTEE

Lanette Siragusa, the chief nursing officer with Shared Health, said health officials are preparing for the upcoming influenza season, even as they continue to deal with COVID-19.

A respiratory virus steering committee has been created, which will help officials prepare for COVID-19 and influenza coming together.

""One of the priorities that we are considering is the vaccine strategy that we will be initiating,"" said Siragusa. ""We are looking to increase the uptake of vaccines this year.""

The committee is also looking at how to shift resources in the province.

The committee is being co-chaired by both Siragusa and Roussin.

PLANNING TO LOOSEN MORE RESTRICTIONS

Roussin said with the case count in the province continuing to be low, health officials are looking at loosening more restrictions in the coming days and weeks.

""We're right now having plans to add to the loosening of restrictions. So I don't I think we are going frame any further ones as a phase necessarily, but there's a few things that are still required to be closed due to the orders and we're looking at how we can open those up and some other loosening restrictions such as outdoor group sizes,"" said Roussin.

Statistics Canada reported July 10 that more than 950,000 jobs were added in the country in June. While only a small fraction of the three million or so positions that were lost as lockdowns were imposed in March and April, the number represents a record increase as those measures are lifted.

""There's a lot of places that are still hiring amidst all the doom and gloom that we've been experiencing over the past few months,"" Carolyn Levy, president of the technologies division of staffing and recruitment agency Randstad Canada, told CTVNews.ca on Monday via telephone from Calgary.

Breaking down the numbers by industry yields clues into where the first wave of rebound hiring is taking place. More than 20 per cent of the added jobs were classified as wholesale and retail trade – with 16 per cent in accommodation and food services, 12 per cent in health care and social assistance, and eight per cent apiece in construction and manufacturing.

This suggests that the retail and restaurant workers who were among the first to be let go when their establishments were ordered to close were also among the first to be hired back when limited activity was allowed to resume.

There is still a long way to go before those sectors can be back to normal, though. In food services alone, it is believed that 400,000 Canadian jobs eliminated during the pandemic have yet to return. Many businesses in the broader service sector say they do not expect to ever return to pre-pandemic staffing levels.

Also notable, StatCan found, is that there were more wholesale jobs in Canada in June than there were in February, before the pandemic hit. Levy chalked this increase up to the surge in online shopping, which has left companies needing extra staff in warehouses and other parts of the supply chain.

On manufacturing, Levy said the increase could be due to companies retooling their lines to produce personal protective equipment or other items suddenly in demand due to the pandemic.

EMPLOYERS RETHINKING OLD ROLES

For the nearly 2.5 million Canadians who remain unemployed, though, knowing where hiring has recently happened only paints part of the picture. More helpful is information about where hiring is happening now.

According to the federal government's job bank, the most in-demand jobs right now are sales associates, administrative assistants and customer service representatives, followed by truck drivers, general farm workers and light-duty cleaners.

A popular website used by job-seekers to connect with employers is seeing similar patterns. Brendon Bernard, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab, wrote July 7 that retail and customer service jobs are among those that saw the biggest drop in new postings on Indeed earlier in the pandemic, and have since seen some of the biggest rebounds.

""Sectors narrowing the gap relatively quickly in recent weeks include ones featuring lower-paying positions, like retail, and customer service,"" he wrote.

""Areas posting roles with many mid-wage jobs have also seen noticeable bounce-backs, like construction, as well as education and instruction.""

Levy said that some employers are also creating new roles as they look to respond to their customers' needs during and after the pandemic. Opportunities created by this include more positions for financial advisers, she said, as well as an even greater demand for tech workers.

Postings on Indeed for higher-paying jobs have been slower to bounce back, Bernard said. Indeed has tracked two categories where new job postings have fallen off since early May – security and public safety, and aviation.

Bernard reported that the number of new job postings on Indeed as of July 3 was 21 per cent lower than it had been one year earlier. That gap had been as large as 70 per cent in mid-April.

This benefits them because it allows them to avoid making long-term commitments in an uncertain environment, she said, but can also be good for those looking for jobs because it gives them a chance to find work that they might not otherwise have.

""There's a reason why they call liver disease the silent killer,"" said Dr. Mark Swain, a University of Calgary liver specialist who led a study published recently in the online journal CMAJ Open.

""It's because liver disease broadly has no symptoms.""

Liver cells are like balloons that can fill with fat over time, especially when someone is obese, he said.

The paper notes an estimated one-quarter of Canadians over the age of 20 have this condition, called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD.

Swain, who directs the university's gastroenterology and hepatology division, said physicians have historically treated it as relatively benign because liver fat usually just sits there and doesn't do much.

But about three to five per cent of those with the disease go on to develop a more problematic condition called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. In those cases, Swain said, an immune response can trigger inflammation, which can lead to scarring or even cancer.

Swain and other researchers with the The Canadian NASH Network, a coalition of doctors focused on the disease, used trends in obesity rates to forecast the prevalence of fatty liver disease in the Canadian population between 2019 and 2030.

The study found cases of NAFLD are on track to rise 20 per cent in that time frame and that its more advanced form, NASH, is projected to rise by 35 per cent.

Cases of liver failure, liver cancer and the need for transplants are expected to rise by a total of 65 per cent to 579,000 by 2030.

Deaths are expected to double to 49,100 in that time.

""There has been a conditioning amongst many health-care professionals that it's not of concern,"" said Swain.

""We really need to be better at increasing awareness, both in the population and amongst health-care professionals and allied health-care workers, that this is an issue.""

A dollar figure for the cost-burden on the health-care system has not been calculated in Canada, but Swain expects it would be ""astronomical.""

Dr. Diana Mager, an associate professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Alberta, said patients are often surprised to find out that they even have fatty liver disease. Symptoms, like a sore abdomen, don't show up until it's well advanced, she said.

""People walk around for years with NAFLD and don't know they have it.""

The biggest culprits seem to be processed foods and sugary drinks, she said. Mager, who specializes in pediatric patients, said fatty liver disease has been showing up in children and adolescents.

A more wholesome diet and more active lifestyle can reverse the disease in its early stages, she said.

There's some debate as to whether the same holds for when the disease is more advanced. But, at the very least, lifestyle changes can slow its progression, said Mager, who also chairs the Canadian Liver Foundation's national education advisory committee.

Simply telling people to go on a diet and lose weight isn't enough, she said.

""It's one thing to tell the Canadian public, 'Don't eat this and don't eat that.'

""But if there isn't an availability of affordable healthy foods, then that's a problem. You can't expect a family, if they can't afford to purchase those foods, to be able to consume those foods on a regular basis.""

JOHN'S, N.L. -- Conservationists are taking issue with this year's annual catch limit regarding Newfoundland's northern cod stock, which federal scientists say is still critically depleted.

The federal Fisheries Department set the catch limit last week for northern cod at a maximum 12,350 tonnes, the same amount as 2019 when the quota was increased by 30 per cent.

Robert Rangeley, science director for advocacy group Oceana Canada, says the decision to maintain the catch limit represents ""scandalous"" fisheries management in Canada, given the current cod population and lack of a formal rebuilding plan for the species.

""It's nothing less than irresponsible,"" Rangeley said in an interview Monday.

Rangeley said the current fishing limit is not a solution to the challenges faced by the once-abundant cod population that famously collapsed in 1992, throwing thousands of people out of work and devastating fishing communities in Newfoundland.

""We all want to see this stock regrow. We need to be patient,"" he said. ""You can't fish yourself out of this kind of biological debt.""

He said federal Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan is not meeting her obligation to prioritize rebuilding fish populations, a duty outlined in the mandate letter issued to her by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Jordan's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Fisheries Department, known as DFO, has not yet finalized a rebuilding plan for northern cod, which Oceana Canada argues is essential for population recovery.

An audit of Canada's fisheries published by the organization last fall indicated only 18 per cent of critically depleted stocks in Canada had rebuilding plans in place.

And while conservationists are calling for a lower catch limit, the Fish, Food and Allied Workers union is arguing it should be raised.

In a statement last week, the union said the current quota is unfair to harvesters because a full stock assessment did not take place this year due to COVID-19. Union president Keith Sullivan said the province's inshore fishery has been hit hard by the pandemic and the quota is intensifying the pressure.

""A rollover for this year's quota is completely unacceptable and must be reconsidered by DFO before the season opens,"" Sullivan's statement said. He argued that the northern cod biomass has increased and a modest increase in the quota is justified.

The Newfoundland and Labrador Groundfish Industry Development Council had argued for an increased quota of 14,350 tonnes and said DFO's approach has been overly conservative.

COVID-19 restrictions prevented federal scientists from holding their annual gathering to assess fish stocks, but a ""regional science response"" meeting was held in April.

During that meeting DFO reported on the results of a fall survey of northern cod biomass, which indicated the population fell within projections from last spring, and it was determined the advice from 2019's assessment was still valid.

DFO's presentation to journalists highlighted continuing concerns from scientists about the health of the stock, which is still considered to be in the ""critical zone."" The department noted there are signs the stock's growth has stalled since 2016.

The April presentation reported evidence of limited food supply for the fish, including declining prey populations of capelin and shrimp as well as increased cannibalism among the cod. It recommends fishing remains at the ""lowest possible levels"" until the stock leaves the critical zone.

Oceana Canada had called for DFO to reinstate 2018's quota of 9,500 tonnes this year, to correct the ""harmful decision.""

Rangeley said fishing mortality is one pressure on the cod population that humans can control and said a cautious approach is necessary for the valuable stock to have a chance at a rebound.

""You can't keep killing the fish and expect the population to grow when they're heavily depleted,"" he said. ""Be patient, wait a few more years, get the house in order in terms of a rebuilding plan, and then we want to see an increase in fishing when the time is right.""

JOHN'S, N.L. -- Cool temperatures didn't stop hundreds of dog walkers, bikers and diners from flocking to St. John's, N.L.'s main downtown street Wednesday evening.

Friends waved to each other across Water Street and approached newly built patio decks to chat, as residents of Newfoundland and Labrador's capital basked in the product of a long-discussed vision that's been fast-tracked by city officials during the pandemic: a pedestrian-only downtown.

""The city really got this right this time. We're very happy,"" Dick Barter, co-owner of Green Door restaurant, said while working on his establishment's patio.

Barter, like other business owners on the colourful downtown strip, said he's advocated for closing the street to cars for years.

Less than a week after the July 3 launch, Barter said he's noticed an increase in business and his customers seem happy to be outside sharing a drink and a meal after staying home for months under restrictions meant to beat back the spread of COVID-19.

With one active case of the illness reported in the province, many restrictions on daily life have been lifted, and in June the capital city green-lit the pedestrian mall on Water Street to support struggling businesses reopening with new limits on capacity.

The experiment will run from July 3 until Sept. 7, closing four blocks of Water Street from noon to 10 p.m. each day, with picnic tables and other seating installed along the route.

Barter noted that businesses had just a few weeks to complete paperwork for their outdoor expansions, but he said the result has been worth it.

Water Street is one example of how cities are making quick changes to support businesses and cooped-up city dwellers in a physically-distanced world where outdoor public space is at a premium.

Cities around the world have introduced similar experiments since the pandemic began, closing some streets to cars and hastily expanding cycling routes, as Toronto mayor John Tory pledged to do in May.

In St. John's, many hope the transformation on Water Street will become an annual fixture -- including Liberal Finance Minister Tom Osborne, who has predicted tough times ahead for the province's already troubled economy.

Osborne had a front row seat to the new Water Street during his outdoor meal at The Merchant Tavern Wednesday. ""It's nice to see the economy start to take shape again,"" he said.

Osborne said he's happy with the outcome that he said resembles the bustling outdoor dining spaces he's admired in other Atlantic Canadian cities that rely heavily on tourist dollars in the summer.

""I hope it lives beyond this year because it does bring more people downtown and it's not only good for the hospitality industry but some of the shops down here may benefit as well,"" he said.

Osborne wasn't the only familiar face on the street Wednesday. Musician Alan Doyle of Great Big Sea fame was impressed by the turnout as he wandered to find a seat. ""It's fantastic, I'm glad to be down here,"" Doyle said. ""I can't believe this is the first year it happened in my lifetime.""

A handful of people were wearing face masks but most had their faces uncovered, including waiters at a number of the busy restaurants. People recognized friends and talked standing close together, but for the most part people appeared to stick to their social groups.

Kelly Whittle spent the evening on Water Street with two girlfriends. The group said it was exciting to see the downtown changed into a vacation-like destination with enough room to safely spread out.

Although it's been lauded as a success by residents and politicians, the modifications to Water Street are still being tweaked after some pointed out the changes didn't consider the needs of residents with reduced mobility.

In Facebook post shared widely this week, Lisa Walters posted 48 photos of herself outside downtown spaces she was unable to enter in her wheelchair. She wrote that the new patios and tables on the street made it more challenging for her to navigate the space.

""The glaringly obvious thing to me was how sad it was that so many businesses could build these elaborate patios overnight, and still not have small wheelchair ramps into their stores or restaurants,"" Walters wrote.

Mayor Danny Breen was one of the many people who commented on Walters' post, saying city staff would review the issues she raised. Walters said in a Facebook message that a subsequent conversation with the mayor left her ""hopeful that some changes will actually be made.""

A Friday news release from the city acknowledged room for accessibility improvements, and discussed a plan to develop a program to install ramps. ""It is important to recognize that this is just the beginning,"" Breen's statement said.

The IWK Telethon for Children, which airs on CTV Atlantic every year, is one of the many charity events impacted by the virus.

“The IWK Telethon is a tradition that has brought Maritimers together for the past 35 years and symbolizes the true spirit of our community. We have always been there for each other united in our connection to the IWK,” says Jennifer Gillivan, the president and CEO of the IWK Foundation.

The telethon, which was scheduled to air on June 6 and June 7, will not go ahead as planned this year.

“We are sad that we can’t go ahead with the broadcast, but we are committed to bring content, as much as we can, using innovative ways to reach our community. We’re forever grateful to our community because they’ve always stayed with us. We’ve been in this relationship for over 35 years with our Maritime community, who in fact have built the IWK,” says Gillivan.

“We know some people are suffering and we would never expect them to do anything other than take care of their selves, and they are in our thoughts, but for those who can continue to support us, we hope they will.”

Much of the fundraising for the telethon has already taken place. Those donations will go towards priority equipment.

“The pandemic is happening and that just heightens and intensifies what’s already happening at the IWK,” says Gillivan.

“Kids can’t wait. They are already there. The sickest of the sick are there and then there is the heightened piece now, with the potential for infection during the pandemic. So the hospital still needs the equipment, they still need the beds, they still need the priority pieces that we fundraise for year-round. Probably now more than ever, they need that support.”

Gillivan says the IWK Foundation is committed to finding ways to celebrate donors and share the stories of patients and care teams at the IWK.

“Thank you to our broadcast partner CTV. Thank you to our many loyal donors who fundraise year-round for the IWK and thank you to our incredible telethon volunteer committees across the Maritimes,” says Gillivan.

“We applaud your unwavering commitment to the IWK. Stay healthy, safe and support each other.”

This comes after 20 million masks were handed out in June in the first phase of the free mask program, something the province's health minister deemed a ""huge success.""

In addition to the new supply at A&W, McDonalds and Tim Hortons drive-thrus, the government is also providing personal protection equipment to the following locations:

Masks are not mandatory in Alberta and Premier Kenney says he would not sign off on any legislation mandating the use of masks, however officials say masks are recommended for situations where maintaining a distance of two metres is not possible.

Calgary is considering joining other major Canadian cities — including Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal — in making masks mandatory in public indoor places. Mayor Naheed Nenshi says the city could implement a bylaw to do so within a week if Calgarians aren’t willing to take matters into their own hands and help prevent a second wave of infections.

Is Alberta prepared for a second wave of infections?

The Alberta government is holding a review of its COVID-19 response to investigate whether the province is adequately prepared to deal with a potential second wave of the virus.

The province has opened a request for proposal to organizations to conduct a third-party review of the government’s handling of the crisis that explore the health system response, economic response, governance and decision-making, procurement, engagement with other governments and stakeholders and communications.

The government wants to see results of the review by the fall, which is when a number of experts believe a second wave could hit to coincide with the annual flu season.

""It’s certainly possible it could happen sooner than the fall depending on behaviors and depending on how people are interacting and taking all of these protective measures into consideration,"" said Dr. Vanessa Meier-Stephenson, an infectious disease expert at the University of Calgary. ""It’s not just the temperatures that are prompting increased infectivity, it’s behaviours as we open more things up, as we have more spaces where people are congregating it puts more people at risk in that sense.""

The bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, were located in a wooded area in St-Apollinaire, Que., but Martin Carpentier, who is suspected of abducting the girls, remains missing.

Provincial police said the focus of their manhunt was an area near where the girls' bodies were found on the weekend and where police found ""pertinent elements"" on Sunday.

""The elements that we possess lead us to think Martin Carpentier could still be around the area, or at least be in transit in that area,"" said Sgt. Ann Mathieu, a Quebec provincial police spokeswoman.

Police did not specify what the items were, but as the search entered a fifth day, police raised the possibility Carpentier could be unconscious or dead, given the weather conditions and the potential he was injured from a car crash right before his disappearance.

""We can't rule out the fact that he could be dead,"" Mathieu said. ""But also, he's a suspect in our case, so it's important for us to find Martin Carpentier, because the key to this event is Martin Carpentier.""

Police deployed a helicopter, a drone and police dogs as needed in the search.

The girls were last seen Wednesday and became the subject of an Amber Alert the next day. Police have said the girls and their father are believed to have been in a serious traffic accident on Highway 20 in St-Apollinaire on Wednesday evening about 9:30 p.m.

Investigators said the car was heading east when it skidded into the median, flipped over and landed on the shoulder on the opposite side of the highway. But police did not find any occupants inside the car when they arrived.

On Sunday, the manhunt for the 44-year-old Carpentier had authorities tightening the search in a thickly wooded area near where the young sisters from Levis, Que., were found.

Residents had helped with the searches until Saturday, but police asked people to stay away from the area Sunday to let officers work.

The case has gripped the attention of the province, especially in the town of just over 6,000 people where it's playing out and in the family's hometown of Levis, Que., across the St. Lawrence River from the provincial capital.

The oldest of the sisters, Norah, was a member of a local chapter of the Association de Scouts du Canada -- which primarily serves the French-speaking scouting community across the country.

Dominique Moncalis, a spokeswoman for the Association de Scouts du Canada, said Martin Carpentier had been a leader with the 128th Groupe Scout de Charny since last September.

It was a brief role, cut short when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the suspension of all activities in mid-March.

She said two leaders from the group have established a makeshift memorial inside a small gazebo in an area park, holding a vigil for Romy and Norah on Saturday night and again Sunday morning.

Stuffed animals, flowers and notes of condolence have filled the gazebo, Moncalis said.

Quebec Premier Francois Legault began a Montreal news conference on Monday by offering condolences to the family of the young victims.

""I'm shocked, and I believe all Quebecers are shocked like me,"" Legault said adding police will do everything they can to find the father.

Legault also urged anyone who sees family members in difficulty or distress to get help, giving out a number for a parent help line.

""If you have trouble, if you don't feel (in) control or if you see somebody close to you not being in control, having difficulties, you don't need to be shy,"" he said.

""You have to do something when you see that you're in trouble before doing something terrible.""

Just one new COVID-19 case was reported in Middlesex-London on Monday, bringing the total in the region to 630.

The single case comes a day after the region saw an increase, with five cases reported on Sunday, after a week of mainly either just one or no new daily cases.

Middlesex-London Health Unit Medical Officer of Health Dr. Chris Mackie said Monday three of five the cases were travel related.

The number of recovered cases rose to by one to 565, while there have been no deaths since June 10, with that total at 57. That leaves 18 active cases in the region.

None of the most recently reported cases have been associated with seniors’ facilities, where the totals stand at 180 cases and 37 deaths.

Meanwhile the total number of people tested at the city’s two assessment centres has exceeded 30,000.

No new cases were reported in other area counties. Here is how the totals stand there as of their most recent updates:

• Elgin-Oxford: Three active, 87 cases, 79 resolved, five deaths

• Huron-Perth: None active, 58 cases, 53 resolved, five deaths

• Sarnia-Lambton: Two active, 286 cases, 259 resolved, 25 deaths

• Grey-Bruce: One active, 115 cases, 108 resolved, six referred, no deaths

Across Ontario, 116 new cases were reported Monday, a slight dip, bringing totals to 36,839, including 2,722 deaths and 32,663 recoveries.

Holder emphasizes safety

As the region moves to Stage 3 on Friday, Holder said his big concern is complacency.

“First it was weariness, now it seems to be us taking for granted the good news of our successful results. And I do worry about that when we see larger groups of individuals that are hanging around that are not within their own circles or established social circles.”

He added that he has seen first-hand a lack of people wearing masks where maintaining physical distancing is difficult.

“I’m in the supermarket on the weekend, I’m wearing my mask and you know there are still a lot of cowboys who think it’s OK, and by the way a lot more men than women, I don’t know why, don’t think it matters to wear a mask in a grocery store.”

He added that he believes at least half the people the store weren’t wearing masks.

City council’s Corporate Services Committee voted 6-0 to recommend turning down an annual scheduled increase to their compensation. A final decision will be made by council next week.

A motion by Deputy Mayor Jesse Helmer proposes a pay freeze in 2020 for councillors, the mayor, or citizen appointees.

“Let’s just keep it the same as last year,” explained Helmer to the committee. “I don’t think this is the year to even be taking inflationary increases. Anything we can do to contain costs is something we have to look at.”

The policy for elected officials and citizen appointees would automatically increase compensation by about 2.1 per cent this year.

The increase is calculated based on the previous year’s change to either the Consumer Price Index or Labour Index, whichever is lower.

Mayor Ed Holder supported the pay freeze for 2020, citing the economic impacts caused by the pandemic both at city hall and in the economy.

“I think it is an important commitment and an equally important symbol to our community.”

Helmer’s motion was co-signed by Councillor Maureen Cassidy and Councillor Arielle Kayabaga.

On Dec. 1, 2018 city councillors’ compensation jumped from about $36,000 per year to $51,181 per year.

That amount rose again on Jan. 1, 2019 with an annual increase of $2.3 per cent ($1,177).

If the 2020 pay freeze is approved, compensation for councillors would remain at $52,358 per year. The mayor’s compensation would remain at $141,200 per year.",[],251,0.9755926093755118

It happened around 7 p.m. Sunday outside of a home on Rita Street in Sudbury’s Valley area.

Officers were called to the residence on a weapons complaint after the accused reportedly shot a 50-year-old man several times with a handgun during an altercation during a social gathering. The accused shooter was also allegedly wounded with self-inflicted injuries during the incident.

""Officers attended and found one male party victim shot and people were working on him. And a suspect was in custody,"" said Insp. John Valtonen, Greater Sudbury Police Service.

Police say the other people at the home were able to disarm the shooter before the police arrived. He was arrested and both men were taken to hospital.

""It was a very violent, chaotic incident and I have to say that the Greater Sudbury Police officers commend the witnesses that were there tending to the victim and subduing the accused person so quickly and being able to ensure that no other injuries were sustained by anybody else,"" said Valtonen. ""The fact is that the accused had attempted to inflict harm on himself, he did sustain self-inflicted injuries, but was taking to Health Sciences North and was treated and remained in our custody.""

The victim of the attack later died in hospital as a result of his injuries. His name is not being released at the request of the family.

""On behalf of all the members on the Greater Sudbury Police Service we send our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the victim and our thoughts are with them,"" said Valtonen.

After being treated for his injuries, the accused was taken to Greater Sudbury Police Service headquarters.

He has been charged with:

First-degree murder

Three counts of possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose

Two counts of careless use of a firearm

Firearm use while committing an offence

Two counts of pointing a firearm

Discharge firearm with intent

The man accused is scheduled for a bail hearing Monday morning. His name has not been released by police at the time of publication.

Police say they believe this was an isolated and targeted incident between two people known to each other and that there is no threat to the public.

""This was by all intents deliberate and the individual was very focused on the one person,"" said Valtonen. ""Anytime that a weapon is used, despite being targeted, the opportunity for anybody else, bystanders, to be injured is top of mind for us. We know that it is a significant concern.""

An investigation into the shooting is continuing.

""There are a couple of scenes that we are conducting, as I said, the criminal investigation is ongoing, "" said Valtonen. ""With anything, once individuals are in the hospital and treated medically and we know the area is safe, then we take a very deliberate measured approach to making sure we collect all the evidence. So search warrants are being executed in a couple of locations, in particular a vehicle at the residence.""

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call police.

""We are actually very encouraged with the information we're receiving from the public, and we would ask that any other witnesses, even if they think that they don't have any relevant information,"" said Valtonen. ""Any information is important, which includes things like video, anything they might have heard, things like that would be really important to piecing this together.""

This is the second murder in Greater Sudbury this year, the other involves the death of a 45-year-old man who has died after a serious and violent assault in the city's Minnow Lake neighbourhood on Canada Day.

""Anytime a violent event takes place in our community, it's concerning. The timeframe, whether it's the next day or two weeks or a month a part, these are two significant, violent offences that certainly impact not just the families and friends of the victims, but the community, the neighbourhood and the community at all,"" said.

The crash happened more than a year ago on the afternoon of June 19, 2019. Police said two vehicles collided on Dalhousie Drive between Pembina Highway and Rochester Avenue/Baylor Avenue.

Three children were driving in the vehicle, police said. A one-year-old child and a four-year-old child were taken to hospital in stable condition.

A five-year-old girl was taken to hospital in critical condition, where she later died. Police allege two of the children were in child car seats, while the five-year-old girl was not.

At the time of the crash, police said children must be in an appropriate car seat until they’re at least nine years old or at least 145 centimeters in height and or 36 kilograms in weight according to Manitoba law.

On Monday, Winnipeg police gave an update on the investigation into the crash, saying it is believed the driver of the vehicle had tried passing a vehicle at 60-70 km/h in a posted 50 km/h zone.

""The driver encountered oncoming traffic and subsequently lost control, causing a collision with an eastbound vehicle,"" police said in a news release.

Police said the driver of the vehicle had a Class 5 Learner Stage licence and did not have a supervisor in the vehicle, as required for those with a Learner Stage licence.

Police said a 27-year-old Winnipeg woman, who is the mother of the children who were in the vehicle, was arrested on Sunday and is facing charges including:

Drive Carelessly – Cause Death

Driver in the learner stage operate a motor vehicle without supervising driver – Cause Death

Drive or permit the operation of a motor vehicle when a child in the vehicle is improperly restrained

The charges against her have not been proven in court.

Police said she was released on a Provincial Offences Act Appearance Notice, though a court date was not listed.

Her sister-in-law warned her that the bear had already entered a nearby home earlier that night. The bear had gained access to the home by pushing an air conditioner out of a window, according to RCMP

Within a few hours, around 2 a.m. Monday, Mcleod said she heard a noise.

""I was kind of on edge because it was just the street over from me. I heard some banging outside and I peeked out and my garbage bin was flipped over.”

She didn’t see the bear at first and said that local security scared it away by driving by, but several minutes later she saw it again.

""I just happened to look outside because I was really paranoid because of what my sister told me. I looked outside and that’s when I got a glimpse of it walking right towards my front doorstep.

""I was like ‘oh my gosh, oh my gosh’ and I was so scared because I thought that the bear was going to try to come into my house.""

Mcleod said that the bear then sniffed around her garbage before security was able to scare it off again.

In the earlier incident, officers were advised by local security members that the bear had left the house and ran into the woods, RCMP say.

Police believe they found the bear a few hundred metres in the bush behind the home and it began running away as officers approached.

One resident of the home was injured while exiting the home and was taken to the medical clinic.

Conservation officers have set up a bear trap near the last known location of the bear, RCMP said.

Mcleod said she is still concerned because it hasn’t been caught yet. She hopes that the bear can be located and brought away from the community.

She and her daughter are getting out of town to their cabin because her daughter is too scared to sleep at home, she said.

The outdoor pools at Kitsilano, Second Beach, and New Brighton would usually re-open in mid-May, but health concerns over the virus meant a major delay for swimmers this year as the Vancouver Park Board formulated a health and safety plan that would allow people to safely return to the water.

All swimmers are being urged to reserve a spot online, as there is a limit on occupancy and drop-in spaces. Demand over the weekend was so great, at one point it crashed the reservation system.

Lane swimmers are being limited to 45-minute sessions during set times, while public swimmers are limited to 90 minutes.

The pools will undergo cleaning several times a day.

Those swimming lengths are being asked to stay five metres apart from others when they are in the water.

At Kitsilano Pool Monday morning, lifeguards could be heard over megaphones reminding some swimmers to keep their distance.

Despite the online ticketing issue over the weekend, things appeared to go smoothly Monday, with swimmers mostly staying apart in the water and on the pool deck.

For many regulars, getting back in the water at their favourite pool came as a relief.

“They couldn’t have done a better job, it was fantastic,” said Christine Ingemorsen, who has been swimming at Kits Pool for about 30 years. “I think everyone is being respectful about physical distancing and i didn’t feel there were any personal health issues. I think everyone was so happy to be back in the pool.”

Verena Foxx stopped by the pool early Monday ahead of her reserved time to see how the new measures were working as she is in a vulnerable age category for COVID-19.

“I think their guidelines are good and i notice people are staying apart,” Foxx said. “I think this is a safe way to get the exercise I like to get.”

Park Board Commissioner Tricia Barker feels the re-opening has been handled carefully.

“We want everyone to know it is going to be safe when they’re here. That’s always been one of park board’s biggest concerns as we open things up — to make sure people are confident we are looking after their well-being.”

Online sales for the next day’s swimming sessions start at 9:30 a.m.

Other measures include one-way restrictions around the pool deck. Pool equipment, like kick boards, are not being provided — though swimmers can bring their own.

Today, lifeguards at beaches & 3 outdoor pools open. Online ticket sales start at 9:30 am for next day. Drop-ins limited.

The cruiser was heavily damaged in the crash and so was Piercy’s SUV.

“He was very kind, and he hopped out immediately and said, 'I am so sorry this is all my fault, I ran the red light,'” said Piercy. “He explained he missed the light because he was inputting data from a previous case he had just finished up and just missed the light.”

Piercy said because there were so many officers at the scene, she didn’t think she needed to find her own witnesses.

“It has been stressful. I thought I was going to be able to just walk away from it and the police would say don’t worry and we'll get this all straightened out. Instead it’s been a little bit secretive,” she said.

Greater Sudbury Police Service says it learned Sunday that the 45-year-old man who was assaulted early in the morning on July 1, has died in hospital as a result of his injuries sustained in the incident. His name is not being released out of respect for the family’s wishes.

""The injuries sustained by the individual were significant and as a result, unfortunately, the victim over the weekend succumbed to his injuries and passed,"" said Insp. John Valtonen, Greater Sudbury Police Service. ""Again, our deepest condolences to the family on such a terrible result of this incident.""

Initially, a 25-year-old man was arrested for attempted murder in connection with the incident on Ferndale Avenue in the city’s Minnow Lake neighbourhood. However, despite being involved in a physical altercation with the victim, police say it was determined that it was actually a 48-year-old man that is responsible for the injuries sustained.

Officials believe the serious assault took place just before the physical altercation with the 25-years-old.

Now, the 48-year-old accused, who has yet to be named by police, is charged with second-degree murder.

He remains in custody.

Valtonen says this is the first of two murder in Greater Sudbury this year. The other involves the shooting of a 50-year-old man in the Valley area of the city on Sunday.

""I really need to empathise, in both cases, how important it was for witnesses to come forward and provide us that information that fills in the gaps,"" said Valtonen.

A $14.1 million settlement will address the shortfall of land received by the First Nation as part of the James Bay Treaty, Treaty #9, which was originally signed in 1905.

Flying Post First Nation joined the Wabun Tribal Council in 2007 after previously being an independent First Nation within the Nishnawbe-Aski Nation.

""I'm pleased that Ontario is fulfilling its outstanding obligation to Flying Post First Nation, dating back more than a century,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs in a news release Monday. ""Settling land claims through co-operative negotiations and respectful dialogue is a key step towards reconciliation with Indigenous people.""

The Flying Post First Nation reserve lands are located northwest of Timmins along the Ground Hog River, however, today the majority of its members live near Nipigon.

""This is an important moment,"" said Chief Murray Ray of Flying Post First Nation. ""Flying Post First Nation and the province of Ontario have taken the proper steps to right a historic wrong for a loss that is almost 115-years-old.

Planning began in 2018 to figure out how to offer quicker medical service to people in that area.

This year, on Canada Day, a paramedic was finally stationed in Goulais River, 30 minutes north of Sault Ste. Marie.

""We now have this paramedic response unit (PRU) here stationed in the Goulais area for what we call the 'Sault North,'"" said Robert Rushworth, Chief of Paramedic Services in Sault Ste. Marie. ""It serves Searchmont, Batchawana, Hayden, Aweres, with a quicker response time.""

From 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., a paramedic is stationed at the volunteer fire and rescue hall located on Old Highway 17 Road.

""This is the result of significant planning and effort and will significantly improve EMS coverage in our rural service area between Sault Ste. Marie and Montreal River,"" said social services board chair Luke Dufour.

When a call comes in, the Goulais River paramedic will head to the scene. At the same time, an ambulance will be dispatched from the Sault.

On average, the PRU is first on the scene and is between 10 to 17 minutes faster than the ambulance coming from Sault Ste. Marie. The paramedic will be able to assess the situation and start medical attention. When the ambulance arrives, the crew is able to load up the patient right away and take them to the hospital, if needed.

Since July 1, paramedics have responded to 10 calls.

Shane MacFarlane was the first emergency responder on the scene for one of them.

""I arrived on scene just prior to the transporting crew and I was able to get in a COVID screening and do a primary assessment and kinda get a general idea of what was going on with the situation before the arriving crew arrived,"" said MacFarlane. “So I turn over a report to them and they were able to turn over the transport time that much quicker.""

MacFarlane added that seconds count in medical situations, so having a paramedic arrive before the ambulance is crucial.

Two new full-time jobs have been created as a result of the PRU being opened.

""The PRU will add support to the many volunteer first responders who have served the rural areas for decades across the district,"" said the District of Sault Ste. Marie Social Services Administration Board in a news release.

On July 11, around 11:50 a.m., police were called to reports of a suspicious package at Montrose Park in River Heights.

Officers found a small package and several resources were called in, including the bomb unit.

It was later determined that the package was safe and police determined the package was a geocache.

Geocaching is an activity similar to a scavenger hunt where people use a GPS and explore the community looking for hidden containers or items that have collectibles, toys, and trinkets inside.

“Geocaching essentially is just a treasure hunt,” said geocacher Julie Mungall.

“You use an app with some GPS coordinates, and it has some clues and you go out and you find the cache. Inside sometimes, you find some little trinkets and toys and a log and you write down your name and the date you found the cache and you move on.”

She said the caches are hidden inside geocaching boxes – which can be bought or made. In Sunday’s incident, it was a homemade geocache.

“It was actually a mini flashlight, covered in black electrical tape,” said Mungall.

“.It was hollowed out and the geocache log was inside. And just the log was inside, so it didn’t rattle, it didn’t make any sound. It was just an empty flashlight.”

Mungall said most geocaches are really well hidden, but this one was more visible.

“This one was little more out in the open, so I can understand how somebody who didn’t know what geocaching was spotted it, found it, and maybe panicked a little bit,” she said.

“After finding the item, holding it in my hand and knowing what it looked like, did it look like a bomb or something dangerous? No, absolutely not. I don’t think so.”

She said the intent of geocaching is to have fun and it’s unfortunate the incident turned out the way it did.

Police are reminding those who geocache to be mindful of how the packages appear and that they shouldn't disguise items to look like they are unsafe.

""Let's keep this activity fun and safe for those participating,"" Winnipeg police said in a news release.

""That delayed a lot of the natural foods so grasses and leaves and dandelions that bears would typically eat when they come out of hibernation, so those were unavailable when bears came out of hibernation,"" explained MNRF spokesperson Karen Passmore.

Since April 1st, the province's Bear Wise reporting phone line has received 1,232 calls, compared to 712 calls last year during the same time period.

The MNRF suggested the vast majority of the calls resulted from unsecured garbage or bird feeders.

Receiving visits from bears on Timmins properties is nothing new, but for Violet Humeniuk in Kirkland Lake, she said it is.

""I've lived here all my life and I've never seen bears and I've never seen bears in town like this before.""

Since April 1, 121 calls to the Bear Wise line have come from Kirkland Lake, compared to 11 for the same time last year, reported the MNRF.

Humeniuk has recently taken to social media to keep people alerted.

""Well I just started this (Facebook) page--well the group--about two weeks ago and I probably got about nine hundred members so far and people are posting videos and pictures constantly,"" said Humerniuk.

""So it's a really good way for people to know what's happening with the bear situation and then get educated about how they can help solve the problem,"" said Passmore in agreement.

The agency will continue to support clients and families with virtual services. The combination of in-person and virtual care options will be sustained for the foreseeable future.

Hands is launching a survey to ask clients about their concerns, what would help them feel safe in a return to in-person visits and whether they prefer to continue with an online option or combination of in-person and virtual approach to service.

""As providers of essential services to children, youth, adults with developmental disabilities and their families, health and safety is always a priority at Hands.

The team is made up of child and family therapists, child and youth workers, behaviour therapists and many more health care workers.

Service is provided to more than 11,000 individuals in North Bay, Nipissing, Muskoka, Parry Sound and northern Ontario each year.

Hands provides services in the areas of: adult developmental services, autism, child development, child and youth mental health and justice services.

The organization plans to use a strategic, staggered approach when re-opening to ensure it meets priority needs.

Some clinicians and employees will begin to return to offices this summer, while others will return in the fall.

""We know that there will be a ‘new normal’ when we do return to our offices. Our ability to carefully plan our return provides us an opportunity to come back better prepared for future disruptions,"" said Roberts.

Hands says it is focused on planning for how the agency can ‘build back better’ in returning to on-site work at its 12 locations throughout the region and in settings with community partners.

""It's even more important for commercial motor vehicles because these vehicles are so much bigger and have the potential to cause so much more damage or possible injury and or death,"" said OPP Const. Phil Young in a phone interview with CTV News.

A major concern for police right now is a spike in crashes.

Commercial motor vehicle collisions have increased by almost 100 from 2018 to 2019. Police attribute most of these crashes to speed.

""Focus on driving. When you're driving, focus on the road,"" said Young. ""Don't look at your phone, don't try to text and don't try to fill out that electronic log book as you're driving.""

Driving instructor Michael Farmer, with Transport Training Centres of Canada, works with new students looking to complete their AZ drivers' license. He sees many mistakes every time he takes a new student on the road.

""Most of the time it's speed or the driver is not paying attention,"" said Farmer. ""One time I saw a guy on the 401 watching a movie from an iPad on the dash. Have some respect for the other drivers on the road.""

Farmer said some transport drivers drive faster to meet deadlines.

""They're being pushed by dispatchers to get to where they've got to go. They've got to get there fast,"" said Farmer.

Police stress it is the responsibility of all drivers, pedestrians and cyclists to share the road and follow the rules to ensure the safety of everyone while behind the wheel.",[],318,0.9288035721436971

Marie closes its doors,'Jairus Patterson',2020-07-11 15:29:00-04:00,"SAULT STE. MARIE -- After six years on Gore and Albert Street, The Neighborhood Resource Centre in Sault Ste. Marie has closed its doors and will look for a new location.

The police chief said the decision to move was made for safety reasons.



""When we had bylaw and the fire department in there was significant issues associated with that facility,"" said Chief Huge Stevenson.



""There’s no way an employer could allow people to work in that, based on employee standards.""

The Neighbourhood Resource Centre opened in 2014. People hoped the centre would help solve the drug, theft and prostitution issues surrounding the area.



As of late, the chief said the area was a hub for crime.



""We had significant secondary crimes associated with that area, open drug dealing, prostitution,"" said Stevenson.



""Really I think it became more of a hang out then it was helping or treating people.""

Luke Dufour is the chair of the board for the District of Sault Ste. Marie Social Services. He also manages a local small business a block away from the resource centre. He said the success of the centre can not be viewed upon simply by looking at crime stats.

""If all you’re measuring is crime, you’re not necessarily going to measure the impact of a place like the Neighbourhood Resource Centre. Because increasing the quality of life is also part of the equation and helping increase those social determinants of health and make them better for downtown residence.""

The chief said the closure of the building is a perfect time to reassess the goals of the centre.



""During the latter part of the NRC, there was no performance measure, no objectives that were being sort of attained to and so this was an opportunity to re-examine what we were doing there.""

Moving forward, Dufour said it makes sense for social services to take over the lead of the next Resource Centre.



The chief agrees and says there will still be a police presence wherever the next centre is located, but there won’t be an officer stationed there all the time.

The John Howard Society had workers stationed at the Centre for six years. Executive Director Suzanne Lajambe said its time to change the goals of the centre.



""We accomplished what we intended to do but as the time went by and needs changed certainly we have a lot more issues happening in our community around addictions and mental health. I think we need to grow beyond when it originally started up.""

Chief Stevenson, Dufour and Lajambe all agree that wherever the new Neighbourhood Resource Centre will be, it should be located in the downtown.",[],427,0.9614467523277891

Beatty said the centre was losing the college roughly $500,000 each year. With new safety guidelines in place and day cares only being allowed to accept 50 per cent of their capacity, the cost of staying open was going to be too expensive.

“Mario is a community champion who truly understands the importance of education both to the individual and community,” Dr. David Nanang, former chair of the university’s board of governors and the chancellor search committee, said in the release.

“He will be an excellent chancellor for Algoma University, particularly in this period of program and enrolment growth where we will welcome increasing numbers of students and employees locally, provincially, nationally and from across the world.”

Born in Italy, and immigrating to Canada as a young child, he had a 42-year career in education, including nine years as director of education for the Algoma District School Board. ""Turco has become a passionate advocate for student success, equity and public education,"" the university said.

""Mario is highly regarded and respected for his experience, his interpersonal skills, his knowledge, and strategic thinking. He has worked extensively with government, school boards, and organizations across the province and country.""

Since retirement, Turco has been active in Sault Ste. Marie. He currently serves on the board of directors for the Sault Area Hospital as first vice-chair as well as chair of the education committee and chair of the recruitment and Selection committee.

“I am honoured and pleased to be chosen as chancellor of Algoma University,” Turco said. “Working in education has been my life calling. I have been fortunate to be associated with students, educators, and other stakeholders from the elementary, to the university level advocating the importance of education to the individual and to society in general.""

""Algoma University has exemplary leadership, faculty, and staff,"" Turco continued. ""I am impressed with their great work, their many accomplishments and ambitious direction for the future.

""I look forward to working with all members of the university and its partners to advance its vision and mission to provide first-class education while at the same time cultivating cross-cultural learning through partnerships with Indigenous communities, organizations and groups. I thank the Algoma University Board of Governors, the selection committee, and my nominators for their confidence and support in my appointment.”

Algoma University’s chancellor serves as the ceremonial head of the institution and confers all degrees. An adviser and supporter to the president, the chancellor is a public proponent of the goals and objectives of the university and is an active participant in activities and the university community. It is a voluntary, unpaid position.

Turco succeeds Shirley Horn who served in the role since 2015. “Our university community is excited to have Mario Turco appointed to the role of chancellor,” said Asima Vezina, president and vice-chancellor. “His skill set will be an important asset as we move forward with our Special Mission, new programming, an aggressive capital plan and targeted enrolment growth on all three campuses.

The past few months put the owners to the test in order to survive. They rented out equipment; they offered virtual classes and races; and they reconfigured the facility.

""The equipment will be spread out on the floor. Some equipment will not be able to be used, because of those rules. Our private studios are already re-set in terms of boxes, you have an area that you can work.""

Porcupine Health Unit officials emphasized that good behavior got the region to stage 2 and must continue.

""As restrictions are lifted and more businesses are allowed to open there is a risk of further outbreaks so we do need the community support and the help to ensure that they are following the public health measures,"" explains Chantal Riopel, manager of foundational standards and chief nursing officer for the Porcupine Health Unit.

She adds, COVID-19 surveillance and contact tracing performance are taken into consideration when the province determines who goes on to the next level.

Working with the Canadian Mental Health Association Cochrane-Timiskaming branch, the program pairs clients with one-bedroom housing from participating landlords, helps subsidize rent and provides mental health and life skills supports.

Brian Marks, CAO of the social services board, told CTV it’s a switch away from the shelter system to focus on what it hopes is a more sustainable solution.

“Long-term, it’s the continued application of those supports that will determine the success of this program,” Marks said. “Getting somebody housed for a day: great, it was a success. Keeping them housed for six months, 12 months, 18 months, that’s where the work really comes in.”

Making an ‘impactful change’

Marks said getting landlords on board for the program didn’t take much convincing, as long as the social services board could guarantee rent, along with added incentives like damage costs.

Clients stay in the program for as long as necessary, until they can cover rent on their own and no longer need as many supports. So far, Marks said at least 20 clients have been housed.

Paul Jalbert, the mental health association’s local executive director, said the program is still a work in progress and will require adjustments as community partners figure out the most effective ways to address client needs.

But with the pandemic seeming to put the world on hold, he said this is the time to explore different tactics.

Focus on building self-reliance

“It lets us really take a step back and say ‘OK, if we’re going to make meaningful, impactful change, this is an opportunity to do it,’” Jalbert said in a Zoom interview. ""Let’s see what we can get out of this, let’s see what we can learn from it.

""It’s a very action-oriented project but in the background, we’re collecting information ... that lets us know if we’re on the right track.”

If the program works, Jalbert said it will be something the association and the services board can take to other communities as an example of how this approach worked in Timmins. If it doesn’t, he said they will keep looking for better options.

But Marks said he’s now convinced that a housing-first approach is the best method to give the homeless population a pathway to break out of that cycle. And when compared to the shelter system, he said it will end up saving the community money since it would reduce the cost for hospitals, paramedics and police.",[],424,0.949029062145975

Many, like Nicole Graham and her husband, Allen, worried COVID-19 would leave food markets closed, which made it all the more of a relief as the market joined others across the province in returning for another season.

“We put in 12 acres of garden, so we’re going ‘Do we take the leap? Where do we sell this if markets don’t open?’” said Graham. “But we were happy to hear that they all opened up.”

Graham said as she’s taken her farm, Graham Acres, to markets in Timmins, Iroquois Falls and Kirkland Lake, she has seen the effort put into adhering to physical distancing and hygiene standards.

Communities have been passionately supporting local businesses, she said, including her farm's meat products during the province’s economic lockdown.

Noella Rinaldo, the Downtown Timmins BIA’s executive director, said markets will be crucial in supporting local producers through the crisis.

“I think if there’s one thing that people understood during COVID, it’s that food security is very important,” Rinaldo said. “So supporting local and supporting our farmers, it’s very important that we do this.”

Aside from the pandemic, farmer Marion Veens said the high temperatures this summer have taken a toll on vegetable production, since plants react to the heat by growing out their leaves instead of their produce.

That will contribute to a tough year ahead for her business, Sunrise Orchards and Produce, Veens said. Having open food markets means an opportunity to battle through both the health and economic crisis.

After a thorough search, the kitten was found in a car fender and has now been given the name ‘Fender.’

Fender is about 10 weeks old and was found under Shirley Anderson’s car, who was able to rescue the distressed feline.

“I glanced at the side of the road and I saw this little black thing hopping and I thought it was a weasel,"" Anderson said. ""I look over and see a man trying to stop traffic and I realized it was a kitten. So I did a U-turn, got out and tried to help rescue this kitten. As I approached … a vehicle almost hit the kitten, then she ran under my car,”

Anderson said someone from nearby Speedy Glass helped her look for Fender for close to an hour Tuesday afternoon.

“We kept on trying and trying, then another man from Fountain Tire named Corey came by and he said, 'hold on I’ll go get a jack,'' she said. ""He jacked up the car and went under the fender, and there she was. She was terrified.”

Anderson then called SAINTS Rescue Sudbury, which stands for 'Safeguarding Animals In Need Today Society,' and a volunteer immediately picked her up.

Found good homes

“We got the cat, we put her in the carrier and I brought her home and now it’s time to get the cat to relax, know that it’s safe,” said Carole Gascon, a volunteer at SAINTS.

Officials with SAINTS said the number of applications to adopt a cat has doubled this summer. Just last month, 32 cats were adopted, which they say is significantly higher than June of 2019.

“We believe we have found good homes for them,” said Gascon. ""Last year in comparison, nothing was moving. People were busy, we had kittens that were being adopted late in the year and now they don’t even make it to the shelter. They are pre-adopted. We have a waiting list of people wanting to adopt cats and kittens.”

Volunteers say COVID plays a big role in that.

“People have the time to spend to get the cat accustomed to their new home and to train it,” said Gascon.

Officials with SAINTS said donations are vital at this time. Money donated goes to feeding the cats and getting them the medical help they need.

While he was expecting to step outside to play hockey with his big brother, a few other players wanted to join in. Among them was NHL star and Sudbury's own Tyler Bertuzzi.

""What I heard is we're just going to take a couple (of) shots, (then) go swimming,"" Lukah said. ""So my big brother mentioned something about the news and stuff … so I walked out the door and I just see a bunch of people there!""

Accompanying Bertuzzi was Sudbury Wolves winger Gio Biondi, who has stopped by a few times before to play with Lukah, a goalie in the Sudbury Minor Hockey Association.

""Just the fact that I thought it would be a normal day and then all of this happened,"" said Lukah, moments after playing with the NHL star.

Nine-year-old Lukah was diagnosed with a brain tumour in November 2019. The devastating diagnosis came just a few months after his aunt faced a similar situation.

""Hearing the news is surreal, it's shocking,"" said Lisa Labrecque, Lukah's mother. ""But we're working with doctors in Toronto and (getting) scans every five months.""

After noticing Lukah was often fatigued and suffering from headaches, the family doctor suggested an MRI, given the recent family history.

""We try not to talk about it,"" said Lisa. ""I don't want to bring him down or get him frustrated or scared, so we treat him like a nine-year-old boy.""

Following his most recent scans earlier this month, that is exactly the advice given to the family by physicians.

With no growth in the tumour, Lukah was told to continue to live life as he normally would.

Despite the recent positive outlook, the last year has not been an easy time for the Labrecque family. That's when friend and community activist Kim Brouzes decided that a morale boost was in order.

""So I contacted Tyler Bertuzzi and said ‘this kid could use a good day, a good memory, certainly a good experience,’"" said Brouzes. ""So Tyler jumped on board … Luca got to deflect or play goalie against a Sudbury Wolves player and an NHL player and it worked beautifully!""

Brouzes and Bertuzzi are now spearheading the annual NHL Charity Golf Tournament, which had to be cancelled this year due to concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.

With funding needed for local agencies, such as the Northern Ontario Families of Children with Cancer (NOFCC), Brouzes realized Bertuzzi's smile provided a unique opportunity to sell face-masks showing off his infamous toothless grin.

""What we did was we recreated Tyler Bertuzzi's smile, missing the one tooth, so it is a smile that you can't miss and can't replace,"" laughed Brouzes, while wearing one herself.

Knowing the cause was important and was helping families such as the Labrecques, Bertuzzi was on board.

""It's funny,"" said Bertuzzi. ""It's a little bit of both, obviously the safety part of it, but the funny part of it (too). It's going to be good and I'm excited to get these sold and get the money to charity.""

The masks are being sold for $70, with all funds going directly to the NOFCC, which works to provide financial relief for families of children fighting cancer. The organization helps those families cover costs such as travel expenses and medications not covered by OHIP and tutoring costs.

""This is a wonderful replacement for (the charity golf tournament),"" said Dayna Caruso, executive director of the NOFCC. ""We're definitely always looking for fundraisers that we can accomplish from a distance throughout this time because NOFCC doesn't have a lot of funding coming in, but obviously over the last couple of days we've seen some very great initiatives come out of the community.""

For families like the Labrecques, relying on support like that and from the community is priceless.

Not only did the two hockey players show up for Lukah, so did nearly two dozen neighbours and friends, who were all gathered in social bubbles to show their support.

""I can't even say enough for this community,"" said Brouzes. ""So within a few minutes and with a few phone calls…we had half the community here cheering on Lukah. But more importantly, showing him for a brief moment the heat doesn't matter, the brain tumour doesn't matter and he got an experience of a lifetime that he will remember for a lifetime.""

In addition to the priceless memories, Lukah left with some tangible gifts, including a signed hockey stick and one of the new Bertuzzi face masks.

Missing from the action was Sudbury's other major NHL star, Nick Foligno, captain of the Columbus Blue Jackets. But he made sure to send Lukah a video greeting to show his support.

That message, along with nearly a few dozen neighbours, was enough to overwhelm the family with gratitude.

""What do you say to that? There (are) no words,"" said Lisa. ""Holding his hand in the MRI machine versus this, you can't compare. This is amazing.""

Those sentiments echoed by her son.

""It means everybody is here to look out for me,"" said Lukah.

Jose Lima, 69, discovered the ticket for the Sept. 28, 2019, Lotto 6/49 draw after his jacket was returned to him.

Lima was shocked when he learned he had won $100,000 by matching the last six of seven Encore numbers.

""I thought I had won $1,000. Then OLG called and the other customers in the store started to congratulate me,"" said Lima in a news release. ""It wasn’t until the validation slip came out that I realized I had won $100,000.""

The man called his kids after he found out about his win, but didn't tell anyone else.

Dr. Penny Sutcliffe, the area's medical officer of health, is also requiring passengers aboard city transit vehicles to wear masks. Both directives take effect on July 8.

“The face-covering requirement for commercial premises that are open to the public is in addition to the diligent work many are already doing to ensure physical distancing and hand sanitizers,"" Sutcliffe said in a news release Friday. ""Face coverings are extra protection to prevent COVID-19 spread, they also send a message that the wearer wants to protect others.”

She said the measures are in tandem with the gradual reopening of the province, which brings new risks of spreading the virus.

“Establishing common expectations about routine face-covering helps reduce this risk now and will pave the way to successful Stage 3 re-opening,"" Sutcliffe said. ""It will also help protect us against a potential second wave in the fall and keep businesses and services up and running.”

As of July 8, city transit and businesses will have to have policies in place to stop people from entering if they are not wearing a face covering. The instructions are being issued under the authority of the provincial Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, Public Health Sudbury said.

Businesses don't have to turn away customers

While commercial establishments are expected to use their best efforts to implement their face covering policies, there is no requirement that a business must turn away the customer not wearing a mask.

""This is in line with the 'good faith' enforcement framework of the Public Health Sudbury & Districts instructions, which builds on education and reminders,"" the release said.

In the instruction letter sent out Friday, all employers are reminded of their ongoing responsibilities to maintain two metres distance between employees and clients, to screen employees and members of the public for COVID-19 symptoms, and to promote excellent hygiene practices including handwashing.

For the purposes of the directive, a face-covering means a medical or non-medical mask or other face coverings such as a bandana, a scarf or cloth that covers the mouth and nose. Certain exemptions apply, for example, based on age or medical circumstances.

“I encourage everyone to be kind, patient, and respectful to one another,"" Sutcliffe said. ""How we navigate this pandemic is our individual and our shared responsibility. These latest instructions continue to count on everyone’s best intentions and my confidence is well placed. I fully expect we will show the province and the world how to do this right.""

Growing evidence shows the widespread use of face coverings decreases the spread of respiratory droplets, and expert opinion supports the widespread use of face coverings to decrease transmission of COVID-19.

Public Health is also reminding residents to follow public health guidance—wash your hands; cover your cough or sneeze with your arm or a tissue; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; stay two metres apart from others; wear your face covering, and stay home when ill.

If you have any COVID-19 symptoms, get tested. People who are asymptomatic, who are concerned that they have been exposed to COVID-19 are also encouraged to contact an assessment centre and get tested.

The regions will move into Stage 3 of the province's economic recovery, along with most public health units in Ontario, the provincial government announced Monday.

Region of Waterloo Public Health Region's Acting Medical Officer of Health Dr. Hsiu Li Wang said the region was notified on the move into Stage 3 on Monday afternoon.

""This will be a welcome update for many in our community,"" she said. ""We are able to move to Stage 3 because of the efforts of our residents to date.""

Dr. Wang said people will need to remain vigilant as more businesses open their doors.

""I ask all residents to please continue to follow the public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community,"" she added.

Mandatory masking bylaws came into effect in the region on Monday. People need to wear masks in all indoor public spaces and on public transit, with some exceptions.

Waterloo Mayor Dave Jaworsky said the move into Stage 3 is ""welcome news for those businesses who have been waiting patiently.""

""We can't lost sight of the fact, however, that we are still in the midst of a pandemic and we cannot let our guard down,"" an emailed statement from Jaworsky said in part. ""This is still a serious issue and we must follow physical distancing.""

He also advised businesses to be deliberate in their plans to welcome people back through their doors and stick to guidelines from public health officials to avoid another shut down in the future.

""Only open when you're absolutely ready, don't rush it,"" he said. ""Nothing is more important than keeping everyone healthy.""

Indoor gathering sizes will increase to up to 50 people, a large increase from the 10 people currently allowed under Stage 2. Outdoor gatherings can be up to 100 people under Stage 3. People will need to maintain physical distance if they're gathering with people outside of their social circle.

The provincial government says certain activities won't be allowed because they are considered high-risk for the spread of COVID-19, including amusement parks, water parks, buffets, dancing at restaurants, and saunas and steam rooms.

Some regions, including the Toronto-area, Niagara and Windsor, will stay in Stage 2.

SIU Director Joseph Martino said based on preliminary inquiries “it is apparent that the SIU is without jurisdiction to continue with the investigation,” as the injuries sustained do not amount to a “serious injury” within the SIU’s terms.

It was reported on the night of June 23, Essex OPP officers responded to a mischief call and located a 26-year-old man. After a struggle, the man was arrested and placed in the back of a police cruiser.

A news release from SIU states that while in the back of the cruiser “the man smashed his head and face off the plexiglass partition in the rear with great force.”

He was then taken to the hospital by EMS.

Martino said originally the matter was reported to the SIU as involving a brain bleed and concussion, however, upon reviewing the man’s medical records he was taken to the hospital where his injuries were determined to be a “subdural hematoma of no significant mass or effect.”

Since the man’s injuries do not fall within the terms of the SIU’s jurisdiction the investigation has been discontinued and the file closed.

With an announcement scheduled from the province Monday afternoon regarding plans around Stage 3, medical officer of health Wajid Ahmed reminds residents the importance of following public health measures.

“We must continue to practice important public health measures. If residents remember these simple steps and keep them part of and integrated into their daily living, we can continue to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our community,” he said.

Ahmed said physical distancing and avoiding large gatherings is one of the most effective measures. He outlined other measures such as wearing a face covering in public, avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands and to wash hands often with soap and water for at least 15 seconds.

An Amber Alert had been issued for Romy, six, and Norah, 11, in Levis, south of Quebec City on Thursday. It was lifted earlier Saturday when the bodies were found. The girls had gone missing along with their father Martin Carpentier, 44, after a crash on Highway 20.

The search continues for the father. In a tweet Saturday night, the SQ wrote that all necessary resources had been deployed for the manhunt, including helicopters, ATV patrollers and dog handlers.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted about the girls' deaths late Saturday night, calling the events an ""incomprehensible tragedy for any parent.""

ITEMS FOUND THAT MAY BE RELATED

SQ officers searching the Saint-Appollinaire area for the two girls and their father found some objects on Friday that they thought might suggest the girls were alive and on the move.

“We found some objects yesterday, but we can find a lot of different objects in the woods, so what we have to do right now is to be sure that those objects could be related to Martin Carpentier and his two daughters,” said Mathieu Saturday.

A command post was established on Friday on Veilleux Street, south of Rang Bois Joly.

Quebec provincial police ATV, horse, K-9 and foot patrols searched the heavily wooded area along with search and rescue volunteers since the Amber Alert began.

GIRLFRIEND MAKES DESPERATE PLEA

Martin Carpentier's girlfriend, Cathy Gingras, recorded a desperate plea to him on Friday morning, shared by the SQ on Twitter.

""Martin, we're worried. We haven't heard anything from you since the accident. We want to know if you're okay, and the girls, Romy, Norah. We want to know if they're okay... if you're okay.

Premier Legault said Friday afternoon that about 80 people were involved in the search, both on the ground and in the air, and that the province had put all of its resources into finding the girls.

The three were last seen alive Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. in the Saint-Nicholas neighbourhood of Levis, near a convenience store, police said.

At 9:30 p.m. a 2008 Volkswagen Passat with the licence plate P75 PXV was involved in a crash on Highway 20 east in nearby Saint-Apollinaire. When emergency services arrived, the vehicle was unoccupied.



Saint-Apollinaire Mayor Bernard Ouellet said the crash took place in a rural area about four kilometres from the main exit off the highway into town.

""There are many wooded areas -- many, many wooden areas -- but there are many rural roads, too. It's not completely isolated,"" said Ouellet about the territory around the crash site, which he added also contains several small cottages and shacks.

He said residents began searching their properties for any sign of the three.



""It's worrying everyone a little bit,"" he said.



DESPERATE PLEA FROM MOTHER

Their loved ones said after the crash that they have reason to be concerned for their health and safety. Authorities say they don't know the reason for the disappearance and have spoken to witnesses and family members.



""All the hypotheses are on the table, and kidnapping is among them,"" SQ spokesperson Audrey-Anne Bilodeau said Thursday, ""but the priority for us is that we have missing people that could be injured.""

The girls' mother posted photos of them on Facebook on Thursday with a plea for help: ""We need to find my daughters and their dad.""



WITNESS SAW CRASH, SEARCHED FOR MISSING FAMILY



A woman driving in the area, Lyne Provencher, said she witnessed the crash.



She said she saw a car headed toward Quebec City fly off the road, hit a sign and some trees, and then flip over.

""I was driving towards Montreal when I saw a cloud of dust and, boom, the car ended up in front of me suddenly,"" Provencher said, adding that she had to think fast to avoid a collision.

""I stopped on the side of the road and I ran to see if there were people inside – nobody,"" she said, adding that three people called authorities at the same time.

""We were screaming and panicking,"" she said.

When firefighters arrived, they used spotlights to search the area.

""Only Martin's cell phone was in the car,"" she said. ""His stepfather called saying he was waiting for Martin to arrive, and that he's told him he was going for ice cream with his daughters,"" adding that he thought it had been a long time.

Provencher said authorities then contacted the girls' mother to inform her and ask if she had her daughters with her, since the children didn't appear to have been in the car.

Provencher shot video from the scene and posted it to Facebook. The post has since been removed.

""There's nobody. The tires are blown out, the windows are blown out. There's no one in the car or in the field,"" she is heard saying in the video. ""It's crazy. I don't understand.""



Provencher said she hoped the person was safe, noting there were child seats in the car.

""I really hope there wasn't a child in the car, because it's really serious. The car is finished,"" she said.

It is possible that one or all of the three missing people are injured, said Surete du Quebec spokesperson Stephane Tremblay.



The subsequent police investigation led officers to launch the Amber Alert Thursday afternoon.



""The car is very damaged and that's why we are looking for them, to see what condition they are in,"" said police spokesperson Anik Lamirande, adding that signs point to the three leaving the scene of the crash on foot.

Generally, the better the weather is, the more drownings there are per year because there are more people in, around and on the water, according to Raynald Hawkins, the executive director of the Lifesaving Society's Quebec branch (a nonprofit that aims to promote safe interactions with water).

Data shows the main culprit for child drownings in Quebec in 2019 was distracted supervision or a lack of supervision altogether. Specifically, 87 per cent of drownings in the province last year occurred because of inadequate supervision.

Hawkins explained that part of the problem is children having direct access to bodies of water – pools or otherwise.

“It doesn’t matter if it’s an above-ground pool, or in-ground pool, or semi in-ground pool, or inflatable pool,” Hawkins said. “The point is kids cannot have a direct access from the house to the backyard pool.”

But beyond that, distracted supervision from parents is also a major problem. In normal times, distractions include checking phones, reading books, or quickly ducking indoors to make snacks or to answer the landline, Hawkins explained.

But with parents working from home amid the pandemic, they may choose to multitask.

A recent poll by Allstate Canada shows that 52 per cent of Quebec parents who own or are thinking of getting a pool are planning on working from home at least occasionally this summer, 43 per cent of which say they will supervise their children in the pool while they do so.

“This (will be) a big distraction for the parents,” Hawkins said.

The Lifesaving Society and Allstate Canada both strongly advise against distracted supervision.

“When you have a backyard pool or when you take the decision to work at your cottage and you’re close to the water… You don’t want to combine work and supervising the kids during their bathing and swimming activities,” Hawkins said.

PREVENTATIVE MEASURES

In order to protect children from drowning, Hawkins said as soon as they can walk, they should be taught to avoid pools and other bodies of water the way they’re taught to avoid cars.

“You cannot cross the street without mom and dad... You cannot go near the water without mom and dad,"" Hawkins said. ""And when you want to go in the water, you need to wear this flotation device.”

Hawkins said that by using this method, children get into the habit of asking their parents to put on their floaties any time they want to play near the water.

This is especially important because a lot of drownings take place independently of swimming activities, Hawkins said.

“Parents try to find their kids and they find them in the bottom of the swimming pool,” Hawkins said.

Parents are encouraged to use this website to self-evaluate their pool's safety.",[],464,0.9672247842858768

What was once strongly recommended by public health to limit the spread of COVID-19 became mandatory on July 13, though authorities have factored in a two-week grace period during which people won’t be turned away from the services if they show up without a mask.

As of July 27, no one will be allowed to enter a bus or metro in the province if they aren’t wearing one, Quebec Premier Francois Legault said. He made the announcement during a press briefing at the end of June and attributed the decision to the gradual reopening of businesses across the province.

“We went progressively with this, but of course, the more we’ve opened businesses and stores, the more people there are on public transportation,"" he said at the time. “Now I think that we are at a new stage.”

The new rule applies to everyone across the province aged 12 and up. Children between two and 12 years old are not required to wear masks but are still strongly recommended to do so, while it isn’t necessary for those under two.

Fines will not be issued to users who try to enter without masks, however.

""The only consequence will be that you cannot use the transport,"" Legault said, adding that there won’t be officers on site to enforce the rules. “…We will be asking people who manage public transportation not let people without a mask go in.”

Montreal’s transit agency, the Societe de transport de Montreal (STM), says some of the details of the new requirement are unclear – like what happens if someone takes off their mask during a ride.

""That's a good example of how difficult it is,” STM chair Philippe Schnobb told CTV News last week.

The STM’s union for bus drivers says its members don’t want to be responsible for enforcing the rules.

“If someone gets into a metro station with a mask and takes it off in the car, you might understand that it will be very difficult for someone in charge at the STM” to know how to respond, Schnobb said.

The hope is that Montrealers will comply on their own.

In an effort to make the transition run smoothly, the STM will be handing out 1.5 million masks between now and September.

The city of Montreal announced last week the wearing of masks will be mandatory in closed public spaces as of July 27 as well.

Below is the letter in full.

Mr. Premier,

Thirty years ago, Quebec entered one of its worst human, social, and political crises. The climate of violence that we witnessed from July to the end of September 1990 had dramatic consequences, including the death of a serving police officer.

Although the Oka crisis has sadly left its indelible mark in our minds, it can still serve as a reference because nothing has really changed in thirty years. However, the social and political divide between First Nations and part of the Quebec population is the result of decades of injustice and forced measures. It is obvious that subjecting an entire population to such actions can only leave wounds that are still open today. Quebec is no exception in this regard; examples abound around the world.

The AFNQL is addressing you today, publicly, first to respectfully acknowledge the memory of the summer of 1990 and to share with you, as Premier of Quebec, ways to prevent history from repeating itself.

The COVID-19 pandemic, police misconduct of a racist nature, a sad thirtieth anniversary, it is in this sensitive context that the debate on racism and discrimination is resurfacing in Quebec, to which the systemic nature is added, whether we like it or not.

Systemic racism and discrimination are not just concepts or theoretical notions. Rather, they are a set of facts and behaviors and we should not be afraid to name and denounce them if we are genuinely willing to correct them.

From the point of view of the AFNQL, when a people denies the fundamental rights of another on the basis of its race, we are in the presence of racism. When this denial is formally and systematically exercised by a State, we are in the presence of systemic racism and discrimination. Again, let us not be afraid of words. They help us face reality.

We must be reminded that the United Nations adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples more than ten years ago, with the aim of breaking with such behavior and proposing viable solutions to States to redefine their relations with Indigenous peoples on a respectful basis. Moreover, the Declaration called for minimal standards to ensure the survival, the dignity and wellbeing of Indigenous peoples. In our view, the political decisions that led to the Oka crisis are a perfect example of actions to be prohibited under the Declaration.

The lesson could easily have been learned.

Against all odds, through recent court actions, your government is today challenging the fundamental right of First Nations to be self-governing, our right to take charge of our own services for our families and children.

Must we remind the premier that denying our right to self-determination will only make us redouble our collective efforts to ensure that Indigenous peoples get the respect they deserve? Putting so much energy and resources into impeding First Nations' desire to better serve their populations will only exacerbate systemic racism and discrimination.

It is difficult to be optimistic in the search for constructive solutions when the wounds of the relationship that should unite us are still contaminated by contempt.

We need to learn from the past and act to move in the right direction, one that will ensure that there is no turning back on mutually agreed principles. As leaders, we share the duty to find a path that is respectful and beneficial to our respective peoples. It is a matter, Mr. Premier, of willingness.

In Peace and Friendship,

Depp said the fight came after Heard's 30th birthday party, and hours after he had learned that his former business managers had absconded with hundreds of millions of dollars.

The Hollywood star is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a ""wife-beater."" He strongly denies abusing Heard.

Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy ""The Rum Diary"" and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard, a model and actress, filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalized in 2017.

Depp said the couple separated after an argument that followed Heard's 30th birthday party in April 2016. The actor said that just before the party he had learned that his former business managers had ""stolen my money.""

Asked how much was stolen, Depp said ""this is a ludicrous amount to have to state, it's quite embarrassing -- apparently I had made $650 million,"" much of it through his involvement with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films.

Depp added that in addition to losing the $650 million he was ""$100 million in the hole because they had not paid the government my taxes for 17 years.""

Depp and his former business managers settled a legal dispute over the alleged fraud in 2018.

Depp alleges that after the party he went to bed to read, and that Heard began accusing him of ruining her birthday dinner before throwing a ""haymaker"" at him.

Depp's lawyer, David Sherborne, asked him to explain the American slang term for the judge, Andrew Nicol.

""A haymaker is a type of a wild swing, a roundhouse punch ΓÇª effective if it reaches the target,"" Depp said.

""I have come across it,"" noted the judge.

Heard is attending the three-week trial and is scheduled to give her own version of events later.

During five days in the witness box, Depp depicted a tumultuous relationship with Heard during a period when he was trying to kick drugs and alcohol, and sometimes lapsing.

He called the relationship ""a crime scene waiting to happen."" But he denied Heard's claims that he slapped, hit, headbutted and threw things at her, and accused his ex-wife of compiling a dossier of fake claims against him as an ""insurance policy.""

Evidence in the trial has included video and audio recordings of Depp made by Heard. One photo discussed Monday shows Depp slumped and apparently unconscious with ice cream spilled over him.

Depp said the picture was taken in 2014 aboard a flight to the Bahamas, where he was going to try to break an addiction to opiod painkillers.

""I was obviously on the nod and very tired, falling asleep, and the ice cream then spilled all over my leg and then she took that ... and showed me the next day and said `Look at what you've become ... look at you, it's pathetic,""' he said.

The Sun's defence relies on a total of 14 allegations by Heard of Depp's violence between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet.

Depp was followed into the witness box by his former personal assistant, Stephen Deuters, who contradicted Heard's account of an incident during a flight by private plane from Boston to Los Angeles in May 2014. Heard alleges the actor went into a rage, slapped her and kicked her in the back.

Deuters, who is now the European head of Depp's production company, said Depp was quiet and ""introverted"" on the plane. He acknowledged sending Heard a text message after the flight saying Depp was ""incredibly apologetic and knows that he has done wrong,"" but denied that meant he agreed with her version of events.

Deuters wrote in the text that ""when I told him he kicked you, he cried.""

He said he had used the word ""kicked"" because Heard had used it and he was trying to calm her down. He said Depp did not kick Heard.

""I was seeking probably to deflate the situation. ΓÇª It wasn't my job to be a relationship counsellor,"" he said.

Speaking of the couple's relationship, Deuters said ""I think they were two people that were in love with each other that shouldn't have been together.""

Depp has strongly denied all of Heard's allegations, including a claim that he subjected her to a ""three-day ordeal of assaults"" in March 2015 in Australia while he was filming a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie.

He agreed that the couple had an altercation, which ended up with their house being trashed and Depp's fingertip being severed to the bone.

Depp accuses Heard of cutting off his fingertip by throwing a vodka bottle at him, a claim she denies.

Depp said Monday that he had surgery on the severed finger when he returned to the U.S. and developed a ""painful"" superbug infection, MRSA.

Depp says the marriage broke down for good after an incident in which he accused Heard or one of her friends of defecating in the couple's bed after the April 2016 birthday party, a mishap Heard blamed on her Yorkshire terriers.

In 2017 she became the first trans woman to appear on the cover of Vogue Paris. Two years later, she was the first openly transgender model to be hired by Victoria's Secret. Now in 2020, 23-year-old Valentina Sampaio continues to break barriers in the modeling industry by becoming the first transgender woman to be featured in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.

The Brazilian model has been named as one of the edition's 2020 ""rookies,"" and models a white one-piece by Haus of Pink Lemonaid and a shimmery taupe bikini by Triangl.

Sports Illustrated (SI) has become a respected brand in the modeling world. Its swimsuit issue has featured some of the industry's most successful names, since launching 56 years ago. Sampaio is joining the elite ranks alongside stars like Heidi Klum and Tyra Banks.

In an open essay on what it means to be part of SI, Sampaio praised the magazine for creating another issue that champions ""a diverse set of multitalented, beautiful women in a creative and dignified way,"" adding that she is ""excited and honored"" to take part. While it means a lot to her to model for SI, she is even more inspired by the significance it has for the LGBTQ community as a whole.

Sampaio, who hails from a fishing village in northern Brazil, has been using her platform to fight for transgender rights. She explains that the beauty of her home country is contrasted by brutal crimes against the transgender community. In a previous interview with Vogue, she pointed out that in 2019, 129 transgender people were murdered in Brazil.

""Our protection comes from God. Even with the new laws, people don't widely respect and comply with them, and the authorities aren't enforcing them either,"" she was quoted as saying.

Her success as a model has not come easily, fighting an uphill battle against discrimination, but she realizes her status gives her the opportunity to make a positive difference. Beyond that, Sampaio believes it is her responsibility to stand up for Brazil's trans population. ""I recognize that I am one of the fortunate ones,"" she writes in SI, ""and my intention is to honor that as best I can.""

In recent years, transgender models have been gaining visibility -- landing ""firsts,"" such as magazine covers, beauty campaigns and spots on the runway. Personal journeys have also been shared to the public. In 2019, American model Nathan Westling, formerly Natalie, detailed his decision to transition in an exclusive interview with CNN Style. He has continued to model for top brands, including closing Helmut Lang's Summer-Spring 2020 runway at New York Fashion Week.

For Sampaio, change means leading by example and spreading love and acceptance one person at a time. ""I believe that better people build a better world for all of us, and I stand for any and everyone who, like me, suffers prejudice for not fitting into society's standards.""

Her message for the world is one of resounding empathy. She vows to persevere in her mission for equality and to continue to embolden people who are marginalized. Sampaio ended her essay, with gratitude.

""Thank you, SI, for seeing and respecting me as I truly am. For understanding that more than anything, I am human. Thank you for supporting me in continuing to spread a message of love, compassion and unity for ALL.""",[],554,0.9717452021783425

She continued: ""We listened to the song, I'm Here, from The Color Purple. Nick and I saw this show on Broadway years ago and we left the theater in tears, speechless.

In addition to wearing mouse ears, all guests ages two and older will be required to wear face coverings in the park.

It is just one of several measures the entertainment park has introduced during the reopening, including possible temperature checks and increased social distancing.

The reopening came the same weekend Florida reached a record high for single-day case count increase, with more than 15,000 new cases being reported by the state Friday. In Orange County, where Disney is located, 553 patients were hospitalized Sunday, according to the state's health website county break down.

Guests will not receive their ride photos if they were not wearing a mask on the ride. The public relations director at Walt Disney World confirmed with CNN that the company has an existing policy of suppressing photos if someone is doing something unsafe on the ride. Not wearing a mask would be consistent with that policy.

Disney is also asking visitors to self monitor how they are feeling and leave if they feel ill.

Prompted by claims on social media this weekend that a guest felt sick on Disney property, CNN asked Disney about its policy regarding guests who feel unwell while inside the parks.

A Disney spokesperson said the company has robust protocols in place and will address each situation individually, considering advice provided by public health agencies and the company's medical and safety experts.

In addition to the health screenings prior to entry of the park, anyone who comes to the parks' First Aid with Covid-19-like symptoms will be required leave the park. Disney will assist the guest in seeking additional medical care, the spokesperson said.",[],288,0.9313502088115256

Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom are reopening Saturday, while Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios will follow four days later.

""It's the chance to come back and be in the magic,"" said Diane Watkins, a preschool teacher from Helena, Alabama, who visits the park about eight times a year. ""Hot or not, mask or not, we're just happy to be here. I feel like everybody here is in the same frame of mind. Everybody is just so excited to be here.""

Watkins said that when she and her 16-year-old daughter walked into the Magic Kingdom on Saturday morning, then saw all the cast members lined up and clapping on Main Street, she cried.

""It was very emotional,"" she said.

The reopening comes as a huge surge of Floridians have tested positive for the new coronavirus in recent weeks. On Saturday, there were about 10,000 new cases reported, according to state statistics. Many cities and counties around the state have recently reinstated restrictions that had been lifted in May, when cases seemed to drop.

All of Disney's Orlando parks closed in mid-March in an effort to stop the virus's spread. Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando closed around the same time but reopened several weeks ago after instituting similar rules to protect employees and customers from the virus.

Lori Lovell of Evansville, Indiana, strolled around Frontierland on Saturday morning with friends.

""I have missed coming here. It just feels really good to be back. This is where I've made so many memories. It's kind of our second home. Not being able to come here was hard.""

Disney's new rules include mandatory masks and social distancing. Visitors will need reservations to enter a park, and they won't be allowed to hop between parks. Both visitors and employees will receive temperature checks when they enter. Fireworks shows and parades have been suspended to prevent drawing too many people together.

Park-goers say that nearly everyone in sight wore masks on Saturday morning. Capacity is nowhere near where it is under normal circumstances, they said.

""I've been here on spring breaks where you can barely walk around. The walkways are very wide open,"" said Lovell.

There were lots of hand sanitizer stations around, and people were respecting the physical distancing cues and guidelines. Since the park is at lower capacity, there was only a five-minute wait for the popular Buzz Lightyear ride -- normally it's about 90 minutes, Watkins said.

Some attractions and dining areas aren't yet open. Another change: visitors can't hug and greet the costumed Disney characters. Instead, the characters are in ""cavalcades,"" or motorcades, as they make their way through the park.

Disney has been opening its parks back up around the globe for the past two months. In May, the company opened Disney Springs, a complex of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues in Lake Buena Vista.

The statement was made anonymously on an Instagram account recently created as a space for people to share stories of trauma they’ve experienced at the hands of others in the tattooing, piercing and music scenes in Montreal.

“Recent public statements have led me to acknowledge that some of the interactions I have had with women have caused them harm,” Desrosiers wrote. “I have decided to withdraw from the band and seek professional help to educate myself and act appropriately in the future.”

The same message was posted to the band’s Instagram around the same time on Thursday.

The claims against Desrosiers – posted two days prior to his announcement – say that he made inappropriate jokes with a minor and began “running after her for sex” as soon as she was of age. The post says a consensual relationship between the pair eventually became uncomfortable for the woman, who says Desrosiers would invite his friends to have group sex with them without her consent. The woman said she felt trapped because Desrosiers allegedly threatened to call the cops on her when she threatened to go public with her experience.

The account, called victims_voices_montreal, began posting just four days ago. Since, around 80 stories have been posted and similar accounts around Canada have popped up as well, including ones for the Gatineau and Outaouais regions.

It was on the Montreal account that Safia Nolin, a musician from Quebec City, made a statement claiming that Quebecois actress Mariepier Morin sexually harrassed her and made racist comments during an interaction between the two at a bar in 2018. Following the statement, Morin addressed the sexual harassment claims through an apology on her Instagram. She didn't address the comment about her alleged racist remarks. Morin has since decided to take a professional hiatus.

Several resources are available for Quebecers who have survived trauma, including the Montreal Sexual Assault Centre at 1-888-933-9007 and Juripop, a free legal clinic at 514 705-1637. Other resources are detailed below by a regroupment of centres in the area:",[],373,0.9719399837457823

As of Friday, accounts with identical usernames (other than the city they represent) have surfaced across Quebec: they exist for Gatineau, Laval, Outaouais, Sherbrooke, Monteregie, Lanaudiere, Joliette, Saguenay, and the Laurentians, among other places.

The people running the Montreal account posted a message Friday saying that, overwhelmed with submissions, they were taking a hiatus, but planned to return after recruiting more people to help.

One of the biggest names to fall is David Desrosiers, bassist for Montreal rock band Simple Plan, who said Thursday he is leaving the group after he was anonymously accused on the social network of predatory behaviour against his female fans.

The accuser posted Wednesday that Desrosiers started making inappropriate ""jokes"" with her when she was a minor, and they had consensual sex after she came of age. She alleged he invited others for group sex without asking and threatened and demeaned her.

Desrosiers wrote on Instagram that allegations ""have led me to acknowledge that some of the interactions I have had with women have caused them harm."" In a statement on Instagram, Simple Plan also apologized to the women affected as well as fans who are disappointed by the ""regretful situation.""

Maripier Morin, a major TV personality in Quebec, has apologized publicly and La Presse reported she has put her career on pause after singer Safia Nolin posted to the Instagram page July 8 -- with a copy on her personal page as well -- accusations that Morin uttered racist statements in her presence and bit her on the thigh in 2018.

Nolin wrote that Morin made a derogatory comment after learning she was of Arab descent. Nolin said Morin also made racist comments about a Black bartender.

""After that, she bit me on the thigh so hard that I had an enormous bruise for two weeks,"" Nolin said.

According to multiple media reports, Morin apologized on her Instagram page, said she remembered the night in question and called her actions ""reprehensible"" without going into details. By Friday, however, Morin had removed the posts from her Instagram page, which is followed by almost 550,000 people.

Bell Media said Friday it has dropped all the shows it carried on its streaming networks featuring Morin.

Company spokesman Patrick Tremblay said in an email: ""We respect the decision by Maripier Morin to put her professional activities on pause. For that reason, we are pulling all the shows that feature her from our platforms Z, VRAK and Crave.""

Quebec singer-songwriter Bernard Adamus was dropped from his label following an anonymous post to the Instagram page accusing him of improprieties.

Adamus replied Thursday on his Instagram that he had been vulgar, arrogant and drunk too many times in his life, and he apologized to all the women he's hurt.

ADISQ, the association representing Quebec's music industry, issued a statement Friday saying that its board of directors has decided to exclude Adamus from nominations for its annual awards.

The Montreal police confirmed Friday the force ""is aware"" of the Instagram page and the accusations. ""However, in order to conduct an investigation, there needs to be an official complaint filed,"" a spokesperson for the police said in an email.

The police did not say if they had received any official complaints tied to the accusations on the Instagram page.

On Friday afternoon, the people behind the Montreal account posted an update saying they were taking a break.

The person who began the account last week never imagined it ""blowing up this big,"" they wrote.

""We are receiving messages from what seems like the entirety of Quebec, which is extremely overwhelming.""

They said they had over 1,000 messages currently waiting to be reviewed, and that multiple people were helping run the account, including some who had put their ""jobs on hold.""

""Our mission was to deal specifically with the Montreal scene, regarding the tattoo/piercing industry & the music scene. As the page got more traction, the influx of stories we received did as well,"" they said, and they wanted to respect all the stories people were sending.

They said they were going to use the break to recruit more people to help run the account. ""During this weekend break, we will be interviewing people with various backgrounds to join our team,"" they wrote.

They said many people had messaged them offering to help, but they were working through personal contacts only.

""We are prioritizing those in our immediate circle to assist us, as this is a serious matter of security.""

But the couple came together for a special Friday edition of her ""Red Table Talk"" show on Facebook to share their side of the controversy surrounding her relationship with singer August Alsina.

According to the superstar couple they ""were going through a very difficult time"" and had broken up when Pinkett Smith started a romantic relationship with the 27-year-old singer.

During their ""Red Table Talk"" chat Smith pushed his wife to be clear about what her relationship had been with Alsina.

""I got into an entanglement with August,"" Pinkett Smith said.

In a recent interview with radio host Angela Yee, Alsina said he had been involved in a romantic relationship with Pinkett Smith, who has been married to Smith since 1997.

""I actually sat down with Will and had a conversation,"" Alsina said during the interview. ""Due to the transformation from their marriage to (a) life partnership that they have spoken on several times, and not involving romanticism, he gave me his blessing.""

Alsina said he had lost money and relationships because of rumours he had been involved with Pinkett Smith, 48.

The actress and her 51-year-old husband have long been the subject of rumours that they have an open marriage.

The couple has denied this, but says their marriage is not traditional and that they have a ""life partnership.""

On Friday's episode the pair said they felt compelled to speak out because there was so much speculation after Alsina's interview.

""We specifically never said anything,"" Will Smith said. ""Coming to the table was like we just felt like it got to the point where you gotta say something.""

Pinkett Smith said she began a friendship with Alsina about four and a half years ago and that became more once she and her husband hit a rough patch.

She also said she wanted to clear up Alsina having said her husband had given permission for the affair, though she added that she understood why the young singer may have believed that to be the case.

""The only person that can give permission in that particular circumstance is myself,"" she said. ""I could actually see how he would perceive it as permission because we were separated amicably and I think he also wanted to make it clear that he's also not a homewrecker. Which he's not.""

The actress said she was ""in a lot of pain"" and ""broken"" during the relationship.

She and Will tried ""everything we could to get away from each other only to realize that wasn't possible.""

Pinkett Smith said her relationship with Alsina ended, the Smiths reconciled, and she said she has not spoken to the singer in years.

She said she and her husband have now gotten to a place of ""unconditional love.""

Smith said he had been unsure as to whether he would ever speak to Pinkett Smith again when they were having problems, but he reminded her of their commitment.

""I told you the first year we were married, that I could love you through anything,"" Will Smith said.

The couple bumped fists as they jokingly recited their rendition of his ""Bad Boys"" movie motto: ""We ride together, we die together. Bad marriage for life.""",[],525,0.9770173732843068

The request was in a letter addressed to high-ranking members of the LPS, City Hall and the London Police Services Board.

In the letter, Pride London Festival (PLF) says it ""stands with Black Lives Matter London"" and asks that police respect their request.

""While we recognize the work London Police Service has done to engage with London’s LGBT2Q+ communities over the past several years, the lack of progress with our Black and Indigenous communities is very disappointing, to say the least,"" says PLF in the statement.

""The response from London Police Service surrounding the demands of Black Lives Matter London is unacceptable. We urge London Police Service to take serious actions to dismantle the systematic racism that exists within its organization and to be a leader among other police organizations in making these changes.""

The letter, signed by seven members of the PLF board, insists that the LPS must start having meaningful conversations with BLM to create a path forward.

They add that PLF would be happy to facilitate any of those conversations moving forward.

Crews worked to keep the fire contained to the home while searches were conducted.

Officials on scene say the home is abandoned and there were signs of people having been inside the home however no one was found at the time of the fire.

No injuries have been reported.

Richmond was closed between Windermere Road and Bernard Avenue while firefighters battled the blaze.

The home is one of three abandoned homes along that stretch of Richmond Street.

The Beards for Bucks fundraiser, held in Owen Sound, Ont. on Saturday, was attended by several politicians, including Progressive Conservative MPP Bill Walker, Conservative MP Alex Ruff and Owen Sound Mayor Ian Boddy.

Southgate Mayor John Woodbury, Hanover Deputy Mayor Selwyn Hicks, Grey Highlands Deputy Mayor Aakash Desai and Owen Sound Councillors Travis Dodd, Richard Thomas and Scott Grieg were also in attendance.

The event was organized to raise money to purchase personal protective equipment for front line health-care in the region.

All the politicians had their beard's professionally trimmed for the cause, but the event has now sparked a backlash in the community, and from struggling business owners, because facial trimmings are banned under Stage 2 restrictions.

""The rules were blatantly ignored by our politicians,"" Owen Sound spa owner Mindy Biggar told CTV News Toronto on Sunday. ""At what point did it make it okay for them to be above the recommendations?""

Biggar said that following Stage 2 restrictions, which prohibit any services that tend to a customer's face, have resulted in her losing 80 per cent of her business.

She said it feels like a ""slap in the face"" to see local politicians, who were not wearing masks during the trimming, doing exactly what she is banned from performing.

""It's incredibly poor judgement. If that was any of us, as business owners that chose to participate in something like this, we would be fined.""

In a statement to CTV News Toronto, Walker, who is Premier Doug Ford's associate minister of energy, admitted that ""despite being aware of measures in place to protect Ontarians, he received a professional shave.""

""I apologize for any misunderstanding my participation has caused,"" Walker said. ""I recognize the need to remain vigilant in adhering to all public health measures and will ensure that all future public events I attend are in full compliance with the measures in place.""

Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound MP Alex Ruff said in a statement to CTV News Toronto that the event was not completely compliant with provincial health protocols and that ""constituents expect better from their elected officials.""

""I personally should have known better and I will do better going forward,"" he said.

Owen Sound Councillor Richard Thomas, who organized the event, said in a statement on Facebook that he ""made the call"" to allow a stylist to trim their beards.

""At the time, it seemed to be a better choice to minimize the length of time each individual would spend unmasked in an indoor environment,"" Thomas said.

He said clippers were sanitized between each person and the stylist sanitized his hands regularly but admitted at times during the event physically distancing was not maintained.

""In retrospect, I should have given that a little more thought.""

""Overall, however, I feel comfortable that the event minimized the risks to all participants, while at the same time, raising money for an important cause.""

The Grey Bruce Health Unit said in a statement they are aware of the event and that while they have not received an official complaint, their team has ""initiated the appropriate follow up.""",[],518,0.9441448012517447

“Every time we see a sunflower, we see Max’s beaming face. He was such a happy boy,” say his parents, Kevin and Jamie Rombouts.

Less than a month after Max succumb to leukemia, neighbour Brian Schoonjans planted a field of sunflowers in his memory.

This summer, four more fields stretching from Forest to Bayfield have been planted.

“This was my first time growing sunflowers, and it was probably the highest pressure crop there was this year. We didn’t want to screw this one up, knowing so many people were waiting to see it,” says Taylor Van Aaken, who planted a field of sunflowers on his Uncle Brian Coombs land, on the edge of Bayfield.

People can come and take pictures with the sunflowers, and pick some to take home, for a donation.

From last year alone, over $60,000 has been raised for charities like ChildCan that helped the Rombouts during Max’s two year struggle with leukemia.

“Everyone has a story to tell, and you don’t know that until you go through something like this yourself. So it’s awesome to know that these fields mean so much to those people, as it does us,” says Kevin Rombouts.

“Miracle Max’s Minions was created to make sure Max’s memory would carry on forever, and I think we’ve done that,” says Brian Schoonjans, who planted the first field of sunflowers last summer.

It’s colourful, creating a sea of yellow as far as the eye can see.

“This is a canola field behind me,” says Jeff Drudge, who has grown canola for the past five or six years on his family's farm near Wingham.

“This is spring canola, planted early this spring. It just started to flower two weeks ago again, and flowers for one to two weeks. It’s a beautiful crop. We love growing canola,” says Drudge.

Although it’s the lovely yellow flower that gets all the fanfare, it’s the pods that hold the secret to canola.

They hold canola seeds, which are green now, but when they’re harvested come August, they’re black.

These canola seeds are made up of 40 per cent oil, so they’re ultimately crushed in order to extract canola oil, which is used in cooking the world over. What’s left over is turned into livestock feed.

“It’s a very versatile crop,” says Drudge.

Over 20 million acres of canola are grown in Canada each year. Only 45,000 of those acres are grown in Ontario, so canola isn’t likely to challenge corn or beans for Southwestern Ontario acreage anytime soon.

“It’s almost too warm here for spring canola. Further north it goes better. Further south, there’s winter canola grown, and we’re too far north for that. It’s maybe not that hugely popular in this part of Ontario for that reason,” says Drudge.

Because it is so rare and attractive looking, canola fields do attract a crowd. Drudge says many a car driving by has stopped to take pictures of the field, or selfies with the sea of yellow in the background.

“I think that’s a good thing. It gives us a connection between farmers and non-farmers. So, we’re excited to be a part of that intervention and conversation,” says Drudge.

Drudge says canola is also a good crop for soil health, and attracts a lot of bees each summer.

“It’s a good food source for the bees, so we think it’s good for the environment to grow canola, as well,” he says.",[],345,0.9702746439761226

A new provincially-led pilot project is installing 24/7 electronic monitoring stations around several suspected odour emitting sites.

The Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks has been in discussions with two waste processing companies in the area, StormFisher Environmental and Convertus (formerly Orgaworld) to create an odour monitoring area.

City staff have been approached about including the W12A landfill.

""We are basically the guinea pig for this program,” says Brockley resident Allan Tipping. “It’s never been tried anywhere else, and I don’t think London or the money being spent by StormFisher is properly spent by putting these up.”

Tipping says this is the 13th year that foul garbage-like odours have made it impossible for London residents living south of Highway 401 to enjoy their yards.

A new staff report to city council recommends spending $80,000 to $140,000 per year to include the municipality’s landfill in the three to five year monitoring program.

“The sensors will basically pick up odorous compounds and be able to identify a profile and create almost a fingerprint,” explains Jay Stanford, Director of Environment, Fleet, & Solid Waste.

Tipping doubts electronic devices that detect specific chemical compounds in the air, will adequately measure the intensity of foul odours, “All this is numbers, and how do you prove offensiveness with numbers from a machine?”

Stanford says accurate and timely data will direct ongoing process improvements at the landfill better than sporadic responses to complaints.

“If we know certain conditions are creating odour, we can adjust our operations,” explains Stanford.

But after a decade of studies, pilot projects, and promises, Tipping remains skeptical.

“We’ve asked them to actually step up and correct this problem. But none of them have the nerve to,” he says.

Council’s Civic Works Committee will discuss the procurement process for the pilot project at its July 14 meeting.",[],316,0.9719172921984596

Every May the Crime Writers of Canada name their Arthur Ellis Award Winners for excellence in Canadian crime writing.

Those awards were announced Thursday night in Toronto. Although COVID-19 concerns caused the cancellation of the normal awards gala, the winners were no less honoured.

The best crime novel award was won by Michael Christie for his novel Greenwood. His story is told in the future and the past, and reveals a tragedy that bonds two boys over the course of time. It is a family story that grows over time to include omissions, half-truths and outright lies. This is not the only honour secured by Greenwood; it was also long listed for the prestigious Scotiabank Giller Prize last fall.

The best crime first novel award went to Philip Elliott for Nobody Move, a hard-boiled crime story set - where else - but Los Angeles. A debt collection turned double murder fuels the plot that draws in the debt collector, his mob boss employer, an ex-assassin, the femme fatale, and of course, police.

Author Robin Harlick served as one of the judges this year and praises the quality of the work submitted.

She says “For the most part the entries were well-written with good story telling and engaging characters.”

In fact, she says there are more Canadian crime writers out there than she realized, “many of which would stand up to the best in British or American crime writing, a standard often used by avid crime fiction readers.”

Harlick was also pleased to see that many of authors set their books here in Canada.

In a genre where location is often a character in its own right, she says there is persistent pressure from international publishers to “set crime fiction anywhere else other than Canada.”

Other winners included: best crime novella, won by Wayne Arthurson for The Red Chesterfield. Arthurson’s award was sponsored by Mystery Weekly, an online monthly journal of short crime fiction based in London, Ont.

The best crime short story was won by Peter Sellers for Closing Doors.

The best French crime book honour went to Andree A. Michaud for Tempetes.

The best juvenile or young adult crime book went to Keep This to Yourself by Tom Ryan.

The best nonfiction crime book was won by Charlotte Gray for Murdered Midas: A Millionaire, His Gold Mine, and a Strange Death on an Island Paradise.

And the Unhanged Arthur award for an unpublished manuscript wen to The Dieppe Letters by Liz Rachel Walker.

The pandemic may have eliminated the annual Arthur Ellis gala, but some of the winners are doubtless conducting their own physically distanced celebrations.

And being writers, they may be considering this odd circumstance for future plot lines.",[],455,0.9774965127536983

It’s been seven years since Marilyn Reid last saw and spoke to her husband John. It was in February of 2013 that he was brought to Victoria Hospital via ambulance, suicidal and in crisis.

“When we got him there I was very relieved and I thought he was safe and in good hands.”

John, a veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was having suicidal thoughts.

“He was in the hospital in crisis and was there a week in crisis and then was released, but nobody contacted me to tell me that he was leaving the hospital. I was actually in shock.”

Reid says she received a phone call from the hospital, one that forever changed her life.

“The only phone call I got from them was to tell me that he was deceased and that he died on hospital grounds. He took his life, just very shortly after they released him.”

Reid says after seeing the CTV News story last week about a suicidal woman going missing after being discharged from Victoria Hospital, she knew she had to speak out.

“I cant believe that people are being released from the hospital and their loved ones aren’t being contacted. It’s been a few years since my husband died and I can’t believe this is still going on.”

The London Health Coalition believes the care for mental health patients is only going to get worse if there continues to be a lack of services and funding for mental health care.

“We in this community have already suffered from losing so many beds, thousands literally,” says Peter Bergmanis from the London Health Coalition. “There was the London Psychiatric Hospital and the St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital that are vacant. So where are these people supposed to go?”

Reid agrees more funding and services would be key, but in the interim would like to see hospitals contacting family before discharging mental health patients.

“I, in my heart feel if I could have seen him and talked to him again that the outcome would’ve been entirely different.”

Policies differ from hospital hospital when it comes to notifying family of patient discharge.

In a statement the London Health Sciences Centre said, “Our care providers work with patients to support their discharge, including calling their families/supports when needed. We welcome families sharing their concerns with us, and we are committed to working with them directly.”

Meanwhile St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital states, “When a patient presents in the Emergency Department, they are triaged by a nurse and assessed by a skilled emergency physician. Based on the assessment, a decision to admit or discharge would be made. The decision to notify a family member is determined through a conversation with the patient. This process remains unchanged during COVID.“",[],459,0.9627523810611905

Mental health patient in crisis released from hospital more than once,'Celine Zadorsky',2020-05-01 14:22:00-04:00,"LONDON, ONT. -- Kristin Legault suffers from severe bipolar disorder. It was earlier this year she shared her success story with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Legault says for the first time she was seeing a positive change with her mental health, but that all changed months ago.

“Because of the coronavirus all of my ECT treatments were discontinued,” says Legault. It’s been around two months without ECT treatments and her mental health has severely declined.

Just two weeks ago, she was suicidal, and police and ambulance were called when she attempted to take her life at her grandparents home in St. Thomas.

She says, “I saw a GP (general practitioner), I wasn’t formed and I didn’t see a psychiatric nurse. Actually they were more concerned with my physical health than my mental health.”

Legualt says about two hours after arriving at St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital via ambulance, she was discharged without a next of kin being contacted.

“They just gave me directions on how to leave the hospital and I walked around Elm Street in St. Thomas at 2:30 a.m. by myself in my pyjamas.”

Her grandmother, Joanne Donkers, found her and got her home safe.

“She just walked out of hospital and I think that’s totally wrong. She could’ve gone anywhere and she was in real crisis and needed help.”

CTV News reached out to St. Thomas Elgin General hospital for comment, hospital communications staff replied via email saying:

""When a patient presents in the Emergency Department, they are triaged by a nurse and assessed by a skilled emergency physician. Based on the assessment, a decision to admit or discharge would be made.

""The decision to notify a family member is determined through a conversation with the patient. This process remains unchanged during COVID.""

Days later and still feeling suicidal, Legault’s GP sent her to the London Health Sciences Centre's (LHSC) Victoria Hospital on a form for mental health crisis care.

She said again, less than two hours later she was released from the emergency department.

Her grandmother, who found her outside Victoria Hospital, says their family is desperate for help.

“We are not equipped to take care of Kristin in crisis. We do the best we can but we really think there should be more help for her.”

Legault says she’s feeling hopeless, “I feel like - Am I ever going to get better? Is anyone ever going to help me?”

So, what do some of the region’s top doctors have to say about wearing masks in the community?

Dr. Dee Hoyano – one of two medical health officers in the Island Health Authority’s Sooke, West Shore, Saanich Peninsula, Southern Gulf Island and Urban Greater Victoria region – recommends that masks be used when you are not able to maintain physical separation of two metres from other people.

Hoyano adds that masks may be required in some workplaces by WorksafeBC, and should be worn in enclosed spaces when near other people.

The main purpose of wearing a mask is to protect others from your droplets, preventing the spread of the virus.

Meanwhile, how you wear a mask can be just as important as wearing a mask at all, according to Hoyano.

“You want to make sure that it is covering both your nose and your mouth because the droplets can come out from both places,” she said.

“So just walking around with it just covering your chin or your mouth is not going to be as effective as if you were wearing it completely on your face”

There are several types of masks to choose from; disposable, cloth or medical grade. Hoyano recommends using either a cloth or disposable mask for everyday use so that there is enough medical grade masks for frontline workers.

“When you are choosing what kind of face covering to wear it is important to make sure it is comfortable and it’s positioned in a way that you’re not having to constantly readjust it or fiddle around with it,” said Hoyano.

Other tips from the medical health officer including applying hand sanitizer before putting on a mask, and after taking it off.

Disposable masks shouldn’t be reused and should be placed in the trash after one use.

Meanwhile, cloth or reusable masks should be placed in a large paper envelope after each use so they can dry. They should not be stored in plastic bags as this can trap moister and keep the mask damp.

Cloth masks should be also washed regularly. Hoyano recommends having multiple masks so you can change them throughout the day.

The medical health officer also recommends avoiding touching your eyes, face, or mask to avoid potential virus contamination.

Everyone should also be practicing regular handwashing and using hand sanitizer with an alcohol content of 60 per cent or higher.

Hayano also urges people to stay home if they feel at all unwell to keep everyone safe during the pandemic.

“We want people in that situation staying home, we don’t want them going out just wearing a mask. The best protection there is to stay home so you’re not in contact with anybody,” she said.

“The mask is not a substitution for staying home if you are feeling ill.”",[],469,0.6456402338616987

The incident happened around 1:45 a.m. Friday morning at the Nanaimo SCPA on Westwood Road.

The video shows a shirtless man wearing blue jeans with white shoes on, running up to the front door of the SPCA and tagging it with black spray paint. The vandal took less than 30 seconds and ran away from the building in the same direction.

“It wasn’t nice for the team to come into and see this morning. COVID-19 has been a struggle for everybody, us included,” said Leon Davis, branch manager of the Nanaimo SPCA on Friday.

“Fundraising hasn’t been easy, and we really don’t need to be redirecting funds to be cleaning up senseless graffiti off our building,” he said.

Theft from the shelter has happened before, but Davis says this is the first time it has been vandalized.

Local street artists with the Humanity In Art organization are big animal lovers and saw a Facebook post about the incident. On Friday afternoon, they came by the Nanaimo SPCA to help clean up the graffiti.

“We work with spray paint a lot and have the tools and products to try and deal with it,” said Lauren Semple with Humanity In Art.

First Nations discuss closing their borders to tourists,'Nick Wells',2020-07-13 06:48:00-07:00,"VANCOUVER -- Indigenous bands along the west coast of British Columbia say their borders will remain closed to tourists and non-residents, despite the economic impact, as they work to raise awareness about the threat COVID-19 poses to their communities.

The Nuu-chah-nulth, the Heiltsuk Nation and the Haida Nation have all closed or restricted access to their territories and reserves.

“Of course it's negatively impacting. But our directors have said, our chiefs have said, people before economics,” said Judith Sayers, the president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, in an interview. “I think everyone is slowly realizing the impact economically, but right now we just really feel that we want to protect the members first.”

Members of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, made up of 14 First Nations along the west coast of Vancouver Island, have deployed a variety of tactics to help ensure their borders are kept sealed from non-residents.

Members of the Ahousaht First Nation, who live in the remote area of Flores Island, have deputized citizens to act as peacekeeping officers, Sayers said.

The Ahousaht issued a notice on July 2 that their territory, which covers a large area of land and water north of Tofino, including provincial parks, will remain closed to tourists and non-residents as there “is still no vaccine, no anti-serum and no cure for COVID-19.”

Others, like the Tla-o-qui-aht in Tofino, had been stopping cars in an effort to convince them to turn around.

While Tofino is now welcoming back visitors, the Tla-o-qui-aht communities of Ty-Histanis, Esowista and Opitsaht remain closed to those who haven't been invited. The closure includes part of Long Beach in Pacific Rim National Park.

The concern, Sayers says, lies in the ability to test and contain any potential COVID-19 outbreak.

“A lot of our communities are remote and testing is not easily available,” she said. “If you're in Port Alberni, or Nanaimo, or Victoria, or somewhere (else), you can get testing and get results in 24 hours. It's not the same with our communities.”

The closures have resulted in disputes between Indigenous groups and local businesses.

The Haida Nation in Haida Gwaii have turned away non-residents at the ferry terminal, discouraged leisure travel and called on two local fishing lodges to rethink their reopening plans.

“We're such a close-knit community, I think that once we get a case of COVID, I think that it'll spread like wildfire,” said Duffy Edgars, the chief councillor of the Old Massett Village council in Haida Gwaii.

Edgars said many local fishing lodges are respecting the Haida Nation's state of emergency, but is frustrated by others who want to open up.

“It's disrespectful,” he said. “These bigger (lodges) are coming in and just doing whatever they want.”

The fishing lodges that have opened say visitors and staff will not have contact with the Haida Gwaii communities, and they have emergence evacuation plans in place if a COVID-19 case were to develop.

Leaders and representatives from the Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk and Haida all say they would like to see more co-operation from the provincial government in working with Indigenous communities.

“It's really frustrating,” said Marilyn Slett, the chief councillor of the Heiltsuk. “We have a limited amount of time here, we think, before that anticipated second or third wave so right now is the time for us to be sitting down and having those discussions so going forward we're all working collaboratively together.”

Part of the issue, she says, lies in B.C. politicians encouraging residents to take part in inter-provincial tourism.

“We're seeing a lot more vessel traffic on the coast, we're seeing a lot more recreational boaters, and that's a really high concern for our community,” said Slett.

The closures - many of which began in March - have been felt at a variety of levels.

The pandemic forced the cancellation of the Heiltsuk's Spawn-on-Kelp fishery this year, an event Slett says employs 700 people and is a hugely important economic driver for the community.

“Certainly our community put forward the health and safety before the economic driver,” she said. “So our community has been hit hard.”

Sayers says when the pandemic first broke out and restrictions were placed on communities, First Nations were bringing in food for members so they didn't have to leave their reserves and face possible exposure at grocery stores.

The Heiltsuk, Nuu-chah-Nulth and the Tsilhqot'in issued a statement in late June, criticizing the provincial government's reopening plan and what they saw as a lack of dialogue with First Nations groups.

All three want the province to commit to four conditions, which would allow border restrictions being lifted: COVID-19 information sharing, screening, rapid testing and culturally safe contact tracing teams.

Until those are met, Slett says, she can't see Indigenous communities fully opening their borders.

But the provincial government says it is committed to working with Indigenous communities.

“Many tourist-depending communities are now safely welcoming the gradual return of out-of-town visitors,” said Sarah Plank, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation.

“At the same time, we acknowledge some smaller and more remote communities and First Nations continue to be concerned about visitors to their communities.”

The government is also working on scheduling a meeting with the Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsilquot'in, Heiltsuk and Haida Nations and other communities, she added.

For the second time this week, a Victoria tattoo studio is announcing it has fired an employee due to claims of sexual assault.

Painted Lotus Studios released a statement on its social media platforms on Tuesday, July 7th, saying the company had terminated Corey Lyon and that it supports the work of Victim's Voices Canada, where a post was made claiming Lyon had sexually abused a client.

Artist Dave Hadden was also terminated this week from Carne Tattoo following allegations of sexual assault.

The post in question, made anonymously a day after Painted Lotus's post, says the artist was examining her for an under breast tattoo when he picked her up and put her on his table.

""That's when the little lightbulb in my head went on and I realized this was sexual. This was close to another particularly traumatizing sexual assault experience so I froze up and allowed everything else that happened to happen including aggressive oral sex.""

Lotus Tattoo said they were shocked by the allegations.

""We hope for everyone's sake that this was an isolated incident, but cannot in good conscience stand by Corey's actions. He is no longer employed at Painted Lotus. We are grateful for, and stand by the work that Victims Voices Canada does giving a platform for victims to be heard. This is an industry with a long history of toxic behaviour that has been swept under the rug. We want to support survivors and prevent abuse wherever possible.""

Another poster on Victims Voices Canada claims Lyon was also inappropriate with her.

""The incident with Corey Lyon is not an isolated one. I was tattooed by him a few years ago and the entire experience was uncomfortable for me. The tattoo I was getting was on the back of my arm so I was laying down while getting it done. Corey continuously ran his hands up and down my back and the backs of my thighs and at certain points would rest his hand on my butt. Throughout out the tattoo he kept calling me baby girl and sweetheart and repeatedly asked if I was single.""

In an email to CFAX 1070, the owner of Painted Lotus said they are focusing on the mental health of their clientele, studio and staff.

""The damage caused by abusers traumatizes their victims, and from this experience, we know it also goes beyond that. Our entire community is damaged, families torn apart, and the sacred professional trusts between artist and client have been broken. We hope that the current whistleblowing movement gives victims a voice and a chance to heal first and foremost. For those seeing these accounts from the outside, we hope it creates more opportunity for accountability and self-assessment in our industry. As tattooers, we can all do better to create a place of trust and safety. We are humbled by every human who allows us to work with them everyday. The trust they extend to us is deserving of the utmost respect and we will continue to evolve with this as our focus.""

Lyon has not been charged and none of the allegations have been tested in court.

On Friday in B.C. Supreme Court in Victoria, Madame Justice Jennifer Power passed sentence over the 51-year-old Mostowy, the former owner of All-Canadian Construction.

He was convicted of sexually assaulting his employee over two to three weeks between May and June of 2014.

Mostowy assaulted the female employee on six separate occasions while he was out on bail after being accused of sexually assaulting five women who worked in his Langford-based office in 2010 and 2011.

During Friday’s sentencing, Power referenced a written victim impact statement in which Mostowy’s victim wrote she has suffered with depression and has been subjected to financial hardship since the sexual assaults.

Power also noted the similarity of the sexual offences suffered by the female employee in 2014 and the circumstances of a previous sexual assault conviction in January 2016.

In January 2017, the Langford contractor was sentenced to 36 months in prison for sexually assaulting five female employees. At his 2016 trial, the court heard all five of the female employees describe similar circumstances. At that time, the women said Mostowy gave them unwanted massages which escalated over time to unconsentual sexual touching and sexual acts.

In Friday’s sentencing decision, Power noted that Mostowy used his position of trust and power over his victim to work alone with her at job sites. It was while they were alone on those job sites that Mostowy tried to coerce the victim into touching his exposed genitals. Power suggested that Mostowy exploited his female employee’s vulnerability because, as her employer, she relied on him to earn her living as a dry-waller.

Power also noted that Mostowy continues to deny he assaulted the female dry-waller and he has shown no remorse for his actions.

Two reports from psychologists prepared for Friday’s sentencing stated that Mostowy poses a low to moderate risk to re-offend.

She sentenced Mostowy a nine-month sentence to be served in a provincial jail. When he is released, he will serve an additional 24 months probation. Mostowy must provide a sample of his DNA. His sentence also includes and automatic lifetime ban from owning or possessing a firearm and ammunition.

The sentence order also bars him from contacting the victim of the assaults or attending to a home where she may live or a place of business or school that she may be attending.

When he is released he is to advise his probation officer of any relationships he may have and any changes to those relationships that may occur.

The judge informed the court that Mostowy intends to appeal his conviction.",[],439,0.9762947236608184

The bat was found inside a Nanoose Bay home last week and may have come in contact with the homeowner's dog.

“Whenever you have a bat in someone’s house, then we always have to question, is that normal behaviour of a bat?"" says Dr. Erin Langwith, veterinarian at Harbour City Animal Hospital.

""So if there’s a contact like that, we submit it for testing.”

It's the second bat in the last month the Nanaimo animal hospital submitted for testing. The first bat came back negative.

The dog was given a rabies vaccine booster and will be in self-isolation inside its Nanoose Bay home for three months.

The vaccine is very effective in preventing the disease if pets are vaccinated within seven days of potentially being exposed, the vet said.

If your pet potentially comes in contact with a bat, Langwith says collect the bat safely and bring it in to be tested.

If you look at the pictures accompanying the post, it seems like there are more than five.

“They can turn into seven or eight,” Tossa laughs. “Depending on what you like to wear.”

Tossa shows me the first dress she bought, featuring fabric cascading to the floor: “My mom didn’t like it,” she explains. “So it’s never been worn.”

The second one is a little simpler. Her mom did like it, so Tossa wore it during the ceremony in Sooke. She shows me a picture of her wearing it while walking between her parents.

“Then — to spice it up — I put a tutu underneath,” Tossa smiles, pointing to the official wedding photos which show the rainbow-coloured tutu emerging from the white dress.

Later that evening at the reception, Tossa wore the tutu under a shorter third dress with lights attached to it.

“I like colour!” she smiles. “So I had to add a lot of colour to my dresses.""

Her life had been just as dynamic as her wedding wear. Tossa says she’s clinically died 13 times because of complications due to Type 1 diabetes.

“It made me go blind,” she explains. “It gave me Charcot-Marie joint syndrome in my one foot, and kidney failure.”

Tossa was adopted (and never knew her birth family) but credits the people who raised her with supporting her through decades of health problems.

“My parents were just amazing,” she says. “And my brother.”

Tossa ended up enduring six surgeries to correct her vision, while 27 pins and plates were used to fix her foot. “The doctor said there wasn’t any room fit more,” she laughs.

Tossa’s diabetes was also cured after a pancreas-kidney transplant. The donor was a crash victim from a different city — a stranger with an unexpected connection to her birth family.

“My surgeon said she was 99.9% probably my [biological] sister,” Tossa says. “I didn’t even know about her.”

Tossa says her feelings about the origins of her organs are complicated, but is ultimately grateful for the chance to keep living and eventually meet the love of her life.

All the wedding dresses were worn to marry the same man, Jody.

Tossa shows me pictures of her wearing the fourth dress at their ceremony on a beach in Mexico. It was for the friends who couldn’t make it to Sooke. She wore the fifth and final dress at that reception.

‘I’m going to live my life to the best that I possibly can,” Tossa says of her celebrations, now that her health problems are behind her.

Now she’s hoping that by selling her dresses another bride — or five — will be able to celebrate living and loving life to the fullest too.

A Victoria tattoo parlour says it has fired one of its artists after allegations of sexual assault came to light this week, but the business knew about at least one other alleged assault for over a year.

Carne Tattoo in Victoria posted on its Instagram account, saying the company had terminated one of its artists for his ""betrayal of young women"" and of their space.

The post was made on Monday, July 6, after another Instagram user posted a detailed account of an alleged sexual assault by Carne Tattoo artist Dave Hadden, though Carne does not say the posts are connected.

The user claims the incident happened two years ago, when she was 18 years old. She says Hadden slowly moved his fingers between her legs through the course of the tattoo until he eventually had nonconsensual ""digital sex"" with her. She claims he had his fingers inside of her for over half of the four-hour appointment.

The accusations were made on Victims Voices Canada, a page which posts anonymous allegations of abuse, assault, and violence by those in the tattoo and piercing industry.

Hadden, known as TygrDave on Instagram, admitted to the allegations on the social media platform on Tuesday.

""The accusations of me sexually assaulting a client at my former place of employment are true and disgusting, it was a line I should have never crossed,"" Hadded said. ""I am deeply sorry, I do not condone this behavior in anyway shape of form. Theres nothing I can say right now other than that i am so unbelievably sorry. I will be taking a step back from tattooing and seeking professional help.""

One of Hadden's other alleged victims, called 'Sarah' in this article to protect her identity, says she brought a complaint about him to the owners of Carne in March 2019, after first going to the police.

Sarah emailed Carne's co-owner, Kailey Van Der Eyden on March 27, 2019, saying that Hadden had ""put his finger inside"" her, more than once, while she was getting a tattoo.

Van Der Eyden replied saying they would take the issue seriously and with great care, and asked Sarah to speak over the phone.

After that conversation, Sarah says Hadden sent her an apology email, which she said at the time seemed sincere.

""I would like to begin by saying I am truly sorry,"" said Hadden in an email on April 2, 2019. ""I broke a sacred trust that you had instilled to me and I am so ashamed. Ashamed in myself for letting anything like that get to close to even happening. I can't really explain myself, other than I feel so embarrassed.""

In a second email, Hadden said ""I PROMISE nothing will ever come close... ever again.""

Sarah told the Victoria police that she did not want to pursure charges against the artist because she had accepted his apology. The investigating Victoria Police Officer sent her an email dated April 4, 2019.

""I spoke to Dave just now and he told me his side - which I understand he has spoken to you about a couple of times now,"" the VicPD officer wrote. ""I am going to conclude this file as is. I gave him a warning about behaviour, talked about having conversations regarding consent in the future, and how this file could be opened again if you decide so. I agree with you, he does seem sincere and that was a huge mistake of mis-reading the situation.""

Sarah says now that she has seen the post from Carne about Hadden's termination, she wishes she had followed through with her complaint.

""In the post, they're talking about a victim like I don't exist, like just basically erased me is how I felt. There was me who had already reported it 15 months before.""

Sarah says she was insecure about her own appearance and age, thinking that if she came forward no one would believe her.

""I feel like that's what Kailey was looking at me like, like she didn't believe me. I tried to figure out how to reach women... but I had a lot of things in my mind, everyone was praising how wonderful he was and I just thought, approaching people on something like Instagram would open me up for attack from the entire tattoo community. It was so great when this young woman finally posted, now we know it was lots of women.""

Sarah says there is a support group for women who were allegedly assaulted by Hadden, and many have posted comments online detailing inappropriate touching, though she believes that none have filed complaints with the police.

VicPD spokesperson Bowen Osoko says as a department, they believe victims, and explained how it can happen that a complaint could be made and no charges laid.

""A person who has experienced sexual assault has already been in a situation where their power has been taken away and that's not okay, and we as a police department don't want to participate in furthering that, in doing that to them again. So that's why we really let the person who is making that report guide us and partner with us and set the stage for what they want to do. So someone may want to make a report but may not want to proceed with charges and that's okay, and that's someone's right and ability.""

Osoko says in that situation, they will identity the suspect, possibly speak with them and gather evidence in case the victim does want to pursue something in the future.

In a statement from Carne Tattoo released Wednesday afternoon, the business acknowledged that allegations of sexual assault had been brought to their attention over a year ago:

""In March of 2019, we received an email from a customer alleging that the now terminated member of our staff had sexually assaulted her while working on her tattoo,"" the statement said.

""At the time, we worked closely with the survivor to determine a path forward. It was our understanding that the situation had been resolved to the satisfaction of the survivor.

In retrospect, we should have terminated this employee immediately as this disgusting behaviour has no home in our industry or our shop and our failure to immediately act upheld a system that protects aggressors and continues the cycle of victimization. This situation and the decisions that followed were made by the shop’s management. Our other artists were not aware of the situation that occurred.

Up until this past weekend, we were not aware of any similar incidents perpetrated by this member of our staff; however, it is now clear that this employee’s actions were not a one-off, but rather a piece of a disturbing pattern. When we were made aware of other alleged assaults on social media, we moved quickly to terminate the employment of the artist.

We have always put the safety of our clients first and we are extremely troubled that these actions could have taken place at our shop. In response, we have begun to implement new hiring policies, changed our internal practices, and scheduled our staff to participate in Safer Spaces Training, which will be mandatory going forward. These new measures will help us work to ensure that this does not happen in our shop again.""

At the time of this publication, Hadden did not respond to CFAX 1070's request for comment.

Hadden has not been charged and none of the alegations have been tested in court.",[],1221,0.9379106163998218

Abby Morris is the owner of Crabby Bob's Seafood at the marina where the garbage bags were found floating in the water.

""It just doesn't make sense to me why you would dump your actual garbage bags into the harbour,"" Morris said. ""It would be one thing if you just showed up and dumped a bunch of food in the water because, of course, the creatures would take care of that, but they don't take care of plastic.""

A surveillance camera captured the man backing his pickup onto the dock and then dumping a plastic barrel full of trash off the edge of the dock, followed by several tied garbage bags.

Phyllis Titus is the marina's manager and reviewed video of the incident, which occurred at 5:27 a.m. on July 7.

""He dumped what looked to us, (to be) frozen food that thawed from a freezer. There was fish, there was bread, apples, all in plastic zip-lock bags and then also inside plastic garbage bags,"" Titus said.

The incident happened right next to an open dumpster, which Titus found puzzling. She posted an image from a surveillance camera on Facebook and tips from the public started coming in immediately.

""Even though it's a large town, it's a small town at the same time and everyone wants to protect the ocean,"" she said.

Dock attendant Rylan Fisher was tasked with helping retrieve the bags from the water and the rocks under the pier.

""It was brutal,"" Fisher said. ""It was the worst smell I have ever encountered. There was a few full fish in them, there was sausages, dry freezer bags and random food items.""

The dumping left Morris disappointed.

""It actually made me embarrassed to be a human being yesterday,"" she said.

Titus reported the incident to various agencies which she said are looking into the matter. She said she'd also like to have a talk with the person involved and hopes he'll come and make his amends to staff that had to clean up the mess he left behind.",[],363,0.9885049130908966
509,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/dengue-fever-prevention-efforts-stifled-by-coronavirus-pandemic-1.5021433,1,case covid test new health death report,830,ctvnews,Dengue fever prevention efforts stifled by coronavirus pandemic,'Victoria Milko',2020-07-12 21:38:00-04:00,"JAKARTA, INDONESIA -- To slow the spread of the coronavirus, governments issued lockdowns to keep people at home. They curtailed activities that affected services like trash collection. They tried to shield hospitals from a surge of patients.

But the cascading effects of these restrictions also are hampering efforts to cope with seasonal outbreaks of dengue, an incurable, mosquito-borne disease that is also known as ""breakbone fever"" for its severely painful symptoms.

Southeast Asian countries like Singapore and Indonesia have dealt with concurrent outbreaks of dengue and coronavirus this year. In Brazil, where there are over 1.6 million COVID-19 infections, at least 1.1 million cases of dengue have been reported, with nearly 400 deaths, according to the Pan American Health Organization.

Dengue cases are likely to rise soon with the start of seasonal rains in Latin American countries like Cuba, Chile and Costa Rica, as well as the South Asian countries of India and Pakistan.

Dengue typically isn't fatal, but severe cases may require hospitalization. Prevention efforts targeted at destroying mosquito-breeding sites, like removing trash or old tires and other objects containing standing water, are still the best ways to curb the spread of the disease. But coronavirus-era lockdowns and other restrictions have meant that these efforts have been reduced or stopped altogether in many countries.

In northwestern Pakistan, plans to disinfect tire shops and markets that had dengue outbreaks in 2019 were shelved due to funds being used for the coronavirus, said Dr. Rizwan Kundi, head of the Young Doctor's Association.

Health workers who would destroy mosquito-breeding sites in India's capital of New Delhi are also screening people for the virus.

Having to identify thousands of virus cases has meant that dengue surveillance has suffered in many Latin American countries, added Dr. Maria Franca Tallarico, the head of health for the Americas regional office of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Experts say that disrupting such prevention efforts is ominous for the global battle against dengue.

The World Health Organization says 2019 was the worst year on record for dengue cases, with every region affected, and some countries were hit for the first time.

Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that spreads dengue, is most prevalent in cities, and experts warn that increased urbanization and warming temperatures due to climate change means that its range will keep increasing.

Experts say that while reduced travel means fewer opportunities for mosquitoes to bite people with dengue to become carriers themselves, the coronavirus pandemic has introduced other variables.

Staying home -- one way to slow outbreaks of COVID-19, especially in cities -- poses greater risks for spreading dengue, said Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA). That's because the Aedes mosquito bites during the day, and with more people staying home, where mosquito populations are high, the more likely they are to be bitten.

The impact is already visible. Singapore recorded a five-fold increase in the mosquito larvae detected in homes and common corridors of residential areas during the two-month coronavirus lockdown period, compared with the previous two months. By July 6, the total of dengue cases in Singapore was more than 15,500. The NEA says the number of cases this year is expected to exceed the 22,170 cases reported in 2013, which at the time was the largest dengue outbreak in Singapore's history.

Oliver Brady, an associate professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said Central America and the Caribbean were at higher risk due to overlapping outbreaks.

Working with communities in Latin America to stop mosquitoes from breeding had been the most successful anti-dengue strategy in recent years, Tallarico said. But with strict limitations on movement, she said they didn't know whether these measures were still happening, and ""this is the big concern for us.""

A shortage of protective equipment also means limiting the number of first responders who can check on people with fever or cough, she said.

""My concern is that you have (many) more cases of dengue ... but the capacity of the system to notify (and) test is limited,"" she said.

Dengue patients need acute care, and this could lead to a ""double whammy"" that overwhelms health care systems, said Scott O'Neill, founder and director of the World Mosquito Program.

""The health care system is already crumbling. ... I am not sure how (India's) existing health care system will be able to handle this load,"" said Dr. S.P Kalantri, a public health specialist.

Global research into dengue also will be affected by the coronavirus pandemic, Brady said.

At the WMP Tahija Foundation Research Laboratory in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, which has been studying dengue for years, ""it became too difficult to enrol patients with the social-distancing measures,"" O'Neill said. The facility is now being used as a COVID-19 testing site.

Similarly, the National Institute of Malaria Research in New Delhi has stopped all field work after it was converted into a centre for validating COVID-19 testing kits, said Dr. R.C Dhiman, who studies mosquitoes and climate change.

In Bangladesh, where dengue season is just starting, the launch of a mobile app to help people report their cases was delayed by the pandemic, said Afsana Alamgir Khan, who oversees the country's dengue program.

Experts say such disruptions by the coronavirus will only increase the risks of dengue infections.

But even the best efforts have left doctors stymied about the source of more than one-third of this country's known COVID-19 infections. Not knowing where cases come from makes outbreaks that much harder to stamp out.

Now medical researchers and supercomputers are turning genetics labs into virus detective agencies, looking first to find the novel coronavirus itself within blood samples from thousands of infected patients, and then comparing all of those isolated viruses to each other looking for places they differ.

Every close match will draw a line from patient to patient, ultimately painting a picture of how the virus spread.

""This is the big effort over the next four weeks,"" said Andrew McArthur, director of the biomedical discovery and commercialization program at McMaster University.

""What's going to come out of there pretty soon is a glimpse of what just happened, how did it move around the province, how did it move between provinces or how big was Pearson (airport) in the early days of the airport being open.""

Knowing how the virus spread will show where there were weaknesses in public health measures early on, said McArthur. Being able to keep divining genetic codes from samples will mean when there are flare-ups of cases, they can be quickly compared to each other to see if they're all related or are coming from multiple sources.

It means, for example, a long-term care centre should be able to quickly know if its 10 new cases are because one case spread widely or arose from multiple carriers coming into the facility.

""That's a very different infection-control problem,"" said McArthur.

It also means that maybe, just maybe, the second COVID-19 wave most think is coming won't be as bad, or as hard to control, as the first, because the sources can be isolated very quickly.

""A second wave is likely,"" McArthur said. ""But we've never spent this kind of money and effort before, either, so maybe we'll beat it.""

The kinds of genetic technology being used for this project did not exist when SARS hit Canada in 2003.

This genetic mapping is constantly on the look-out for mutations. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2, the official name for the virus that causes COVID-19, has not mutated as quickly as many others do. Influenza, for instance, changes so much over a year the vaccine has to be retooled every summer to keep up.

But there are enough subtle changes still happening among the 28,000 individual markers that make up a genome for SARS-CoV-2 that cases can be traced backward and linked to the ones that came before. McArthur said it takes a lot of data storage, a lot of high-capacity computer analysis, and a lot of money, to run the comparisons among them all.

The federal government put $40 million on the table in April for genetic research on COVID-19. Half is to keep tabs on the virus as it spreads, look for any changes it undergoes, and map its pathway across the country. The other half is to look at the genetic structures of the patients who get infected, trying to answer the puzzling question of why some people die and others have symptoms so mild they never even know they are sick.

Genome Canada is administering the project, with six regional genomics agencies overseeing the work locally and labs like McArthur's doing the testing and analysis. The funding is intended to create genetic maps from 150,000 patients. Canada thus far has had about 108,000 positive cases, and the expectation is that almost every one of them will be gene-mapped.

The results will be loaded into a global site comparing all known infections of COVID-19, but also be analyzed for national and regional reports.

In New York, genetic sequencing was used to figure out that COVID-19 in Manhattan wasn't coming from China and Iran as imagined, but from Europe. In Canada, it is suspected that much of the virus came into this country from travellers returning from the United States in early March. But the work is only now beginning to confirm that belief.

McArthur estimates the first data will be available for Ontario in about four weeks, but warns it will take many more months to complete all of the tests. His lab sequenced 600 samples on Wednesday alone.

Overall, McArthur expects the genetics project to last for two years.

""I was sick for about two weeks, I was in isolation within our home in a guest bedroom and there was about three days where I was gasping for air,"" Gullacher said.

The Gullacher family has been hit hard by COVID-19.

Paul’s father Butch is the only person from Regina to die from the virus, while his wife and kids also showed a variety of symptoms.

Gullacher’s wife, Aimee, lost her sense of taste and smell for 10 days. His daughter, Athena, had a fever and headache, but Gullacher says she showed her normal energy, and his son, Willem, had pink eye.

He says they did everything they could to avoid the virus.

""Prior to even my dad showing symptoms, we had been exercising social distancing, we were disinfecting door handles, we were doing all the things,"" Gullacher said.

Gullacher’s father had reduced kidney function and hadn’t travelled prior to contracting COVID-19.

He was admitted to hospital on March 19 and put into an induced coma a few days later. He battled the virus for weeks before dying on Apr. 10.

The 69-year-old was the fourth person in Saskatchewan to die from the virus.

""It’s funny that when my mom called me on the Thursday, I didn’t realize that I’d seen my dad for the last time already,"" Gullacher said.

The family still hasn’t been able to have a funeral for him.

""At the time it doesn’t really set in because everything is so unknown, everything is so sudden, it’s not totally clear to you how this is going to work out and you don’t think it’s going to happen to you,"" Gullacher said.

In the aftermath, Gullacher says he’s learned how precious his memories with his father have been.

""You need to cherish your family and spend time with your family now because there’s no guarantee that time is going to be available at the end,"" he said.

He’s disappointed that his father won’t be able to create more memories with his grandchildren.

""He fully unfolded as a human being when he became a grandpa, I’d never really had a ton of strong memories of my dad smiling as much as when he became a grandfather, his grandkids meant everything to him,"" Gullacher said.

Gullacher says his son believed he may have been responsible for his grandfather contracting the virus.

""All he knew is kids don’t get really sick and kids make their grandparents sick, that’s all he was seeing in media, so even though the timeline doesn’t work out for him to have infected him, he felt guilt,"" he said.

Cases in Saskatchewan have remained low during the pandemic and Regina hasn’t had an active case in almost a month.

Gullacher says his family’s experience should serve as a warning against letting your guard down.

""Because so few people have been infected here in Regina, it’s easy to believe that this is someone else’s problem, that it can’t effect us here,"" he said.

Since recovering, Gullacher says his family has continued to take precautions and remain close to home.

He also made the decision last month to donate convalescent plasma, which is being used in a clinical trail by Canadian Blood Services to prove whether antibodies can be effectively used to treat COVID-19 patients.

Gullacher hopes it can help save a life.

The mobile testing platform can deliver results for up to nine samples in about an hour, the company said in a news release.

“This approval is the result of the dedication and commitment of our teams at Precision Biomonitoring and Biomeme, as well as ongoing collaboration with our validation partners,” Dr. Mario Thomas, CEO of Precision Biomonitoring, said in a news release. “This rapid test can now be distributed everywhere across Canada, especially in remote areas and workplaces where creating virus-free zones is vital. We can now bring the lab to the sample.”

Currently, people need to visit a testing centre and wait several days for results.

The SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time RT-PCR Test will be deployed across the country now that it's approved.

Lucy Van Doormaal, who is just three months old, has spinal muscular atrophy. Without treatment for the rare neuromuscular disorder, her parents don't think she'll make it to her first birthday.

""She just looks like any normal three-month-old, but she is eating through a feeding tube,"" Heather Kendall, Lucy's aunt, said. ""It's very different and at night she sleeps with a respirator machine.""

An antibody test when Lucy was five weeks old showed she could be a candidate for a ground-breaking gene therapy called Zolgensma. The price tag of that treatment is $3 million.

""They had heard of this treatment and it's availability, but $3 million seemed like an insane amount of money,"" Kendall said.

The single-dose treatment isn't covered under Canadian health care.

""Every day that goes by, that quality or that ability gets lost,"" Lucy's grandfather Brian Van Doormaal said. ""We need to raise that money as soon as possible.""

There are other treatments available, but Brian said they're also expensive and more long term.

The family is raising money through a GoFundMe for the treatment and to keep Lucy from getting worse. It raised $1 million in one week. Donations came in from across the country, even garnering celebrity attention from Ryan Reynolds and Jillian Harris.

""It's been very overwhelming in a very positive way,"" Lucy's mother Laura Van Doormaal said. ""We are uplifted by the community's response to Lucy's story.""

Kitchener's Play-a-Latte Cafe has also launched a fundraising campaign, selling cinnamon buns to raise money for the treatment.

""We heard her story and, just as parents, we felt for the family and wanted to do something, so this was a way for us to give back,"" owner Heather Lynn Patel said.

Kaysen Martin, an Edmonton toddler, has also been diagnosed with the disorder. Her family has also launched an online campaign to raise money for treatment.

Dino Givani Scrementi is the owner of Dino’s Athletic Direct, an athletic apparel shop on Wyndham Street North in downtown Guelph. He sells all the professional brands, like the NHL, NFL and NBA, as well as some local brands including the University of Guelph, OUA Gryphon’s.

Scrementi said the pandemic and the forced closure of his store has impacted him both emotionally and financially.

He’s being selling athletic apparel in the downtown for nearly 40 years.

“I couldn’t see anybody and I am all about love, people, hugging,” he said.

As many retailers shifted to online orders and curbside pick-up, Scrementi admits he’s old school.

“I am not an online presence store I am a people store,"" he said. ""You want something, come meet me, come see me.”

He’s very well known in the downtown neighbourhood.

“They call me Dizzy Dino, they call me Dill Pickle,"" he said.

The Dizzy Dino nickname refers to the clutter in his store. It’s a style that he says has worked for years and he isn’t willing to change.

“It’s like a mystery, people come in, they never know what they’ll find,"" Scrementi said. ""Sometimes they find stuff I didn’t even know I had.”

Scrementi says his landlord did give him a break during the pandemic. During the forced closure, he started working multiple other jobs in order to pay the bills.

The jobs included serving food at Osmow's, a Mediterranean restaurant next door to his shop. He's still working their part time.

“I’ve been working with Dino for the last three months, best guy, hard working guy,” Osmow’s owner Shah Rukh said.

The doors to Dino’s Shop are now open, along with many other retailers in the city. But with professional sports still on hiatus, he says his business continues to struggle.

Typically, the Blue Jays would be playing right now and their gear would be very popular this time of year.

“Football’s coming up. I don’t know if that’s gonna happen, but I hope it does because that’s huge for business,"" he said.

The 70-year-old says he’ll do whatever it takes to keep his doors open, even if that includes continuing his part time work at other businesses. He doesn’t plan on retiring for at least 10 years.

“As long as you make ends meet, that’s what me mother always said,"" he said. I don’t need anything else, I don’t need anything fancy.”

Dino also runs a children’s day camp every summer called ""Dino’s Sneakers 'N Sandwiches Camp.""

Barb Low has known Dino for 25 years. Her now 30-year-old son attending his camp as a child.

Region of Waterloo Chair Karen Redman, Toronto Mayor John Tory and Guelph Mayor Cam Guthrie all expressed frustration on Monday at the lack of action from other levels of government. Guthrie is also chair of the Large Urban Mayors' Caucus of Ontario (LUMCO).

Redman said the region is looking at a year-end deficit of up to $17 million.

""Our choices will be to increase taxes or cut front line services and front line municipality staff,"" Redman said.

Without funding from the upper levels of government, Redman said the region, and other municipalities, will face some tough choices. The LUMCO said municipalities could be forced to cut family supports, reduce transit services and close parks without the funding.

""As the economy recovers, increasing property tax will happen at a time that people are least able to pay,"" she said. ""Strong municipalities will be key to facilitate local economic recovery.""

“I can't say no to a good time,” said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. “I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.”

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

“Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,” he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

“You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,” said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

“The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,” Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when - not if - his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

“We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,” said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

“It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,” Merhej explained.

“I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.”

The omission is revealed in a series of emails between the two governments obtained by The Canadian Press.

“We have been made aware ... that the Alberta Energy Regulator has indefinitely suspended several environmental monitoring requirements for major oilsands producers,” wrote Erin Kelly, the N.W.T.'s deputy environment minister to her Alberta counterpart.

“Do you have any information that can be shared about this?”

The May 15 email was written more than a week after Alberta's regulator suspended a wide array of monitoring over what it said were public-health concerns raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. Kelly said her government learned about the move from news reports.

Ten days later, Kelly had not received a response.

“This is concerning to many N.W.T. residents, who still maintain subsistence lifestyles,” she wrote May 25.

“With COVID-19 we have even more residents relying on food harvested from the land and it is almost certain that concerns related to reduced monitoring upstream will be brought up during (the upcoming legislative) session.”

Monitoring is expected to resume Wednesday.

The N.W.T. is downstream from the oilsands and in 2015 signed an agreement with Alberta that spelled out clear responsibilities on information-sharing, notification and consultation for cross-boundary waters.

In her second email, Kelly points to that deal.

“The (territory) has not been informed of or discussed new changes to monitoring as per (the agreement). I have yet to receive a response to my last email.”

An Alberta Environment and Parks email shows Kelly's second note provoked an “urgent” request within the department for a response to her concerns.

In answer to a request for an explanation for the lack of consultation, Alberta's United Conservative government provided a one-sentence email.

“There have been ongoing discussions and information-sharing with the N.W.T. on the status of ambient water quality monitoring at sites referenced in the Alberta-N.W.T. Bilateral Agreement throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in March,” wrote Alberta Environment spokesman John Muir.

Joslyn Oosenbrug, spokeswoman for the N.W.T. Environment Department, said several meetings were held in June to address the territory's concerns.

“Alberta has committed to sharing information and discussing any changes to monitoring,” she wrote in an email. “Communication is ongoing, and includes emails and letters exchanged at the deputy minister and ministerial level.”

However, the territory wants a stronger voice in managing water flowing into its land. It wants a seat on several committees that determine how waters will be monitored “to ensure downstream interests are represented,” Oosenbrug wrote.

Marlin Schmidt, environment critic for Alberta's Opposition New Democrats, said the snub showed a “lack of respect.”

“It's really disappointing to me to see the government of Alberta is taking its relationship with other Canadians so lightly right now,” he said.

“When our government is complaining about the poor treatment that we're allegedly getting from other Canadians, we should be treating (them) with the respect with which we expect to be treated.”

The N.W.T. isn't the only interested group that wasn't consulted about the suspensions. First Nations in the oilsands area, environmental groups, Alberta's chief scientist and the scientific consultants who perform monitoring work all say they were left out of the decision.

The government has said the move was made in response to concerns from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers about operators not being able to meet certain monitoring requirements while complying with COVID-19 orders.

Alberta has yet to release work plans or budget for this year's field season of a joint federal-provincial program responsible for environmental monitoring outside various oilsands leases. Industry, which funds the efforts, has been lobbying heavily for a less extensive and cheaper plan.

The report released late Saturday by Iran's Civil Aviation Organization comes months after Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 was shot down by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

The Jan. 8 crash killed 176 people, including 55 Canadian citizens, 30 permanent residents and dozens of others with connections to Canada.

Iranian authorities initially denied responsibility, only changing course days later after Western nations presented extensive evidence that Iran had shot down the plane. Iran has since been accused of stonewalling efforts to investigate the full circumstances around the crash.

Hamed Esmaeilion, a Toronto dentist whose wife Parisa and nine-year-old daughter Reera died on the plane, reiterated those allegations on Sunday following release of the civil aviation report.

""It raises more questions and more questions,"" Esmaeilion told The Canadian Press in an interview. ""It's very hard to believe this story.""

The shootdown happened at Tehran's main airport the same night Iran launched a ballistic-missile attack targeting U.S. soldiers in Iraq, its response to the American drone strike that killed Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Jan. 3.

At the time, Iranian troops were bracing for a U.S. counterstrike. The civil aviation report does not acknowledge that, only saying a change in the ""alertness level of Iran's air defence"" allowed previously scheduled air traffic to resume.

The report detailed a series of moments where the shootdown of PS752 by two Revolutionary Guard missiles could have been avoided, starting with the surface-to-air missile battery that targeted the Boeing 737-800 having been relocated and not properly reoriented.

Those manning the missile battery also could not communicate with their command centre, the report said. They also misidentified the civilian flight as a threat and opened fire twice without getting approval from ranking officials.

""If each had not arisen, the aircraft would not have been targeted,"" the report said.

Western intelligence officials and analysts believe Iran shot down the aircraft with a Russian-made Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15. The system is mounted on a tracked vehicle and carries a radar and a pack of eight missiles.

The report did not say why the Guard moved the air defence system, but noted the Ukrainian flight had done nothing out of the ordinary up until the missile launch, with its transponder and other data being broadcast.

""At the time of firing the first missile, the aircraft was flying at a normal altitude and trajectory,"" the report said.

Esmaeilion, one of the founders of a group demanding justice for the victims of PS752, said one question that stood out to him after reading the report was why that particular flight was targeted and not several others that had taken off a short time earlier.

He suggested the report was yet another attempt by Iran to paint the tragedy as a mistake without allowing a full investigation.

""It's very hard to believe this story and this is the only scenario that makes it an accident,"" he said. ""It was wrongly calibrated 107 degrees, but why were the other eight planes safe? Why? It was calibrated wrong just for PS752?""

The report put the blame entirely on the crew of the missile battery. Six people believed to be involved in the incident have been arrested, a government spokesman reportedly said in June. He said at the time three had been released on bail while the other three remained held.

The report's release comes ahead of the long-awaited handover of PS752's voice and data recorders. Iran has promised but failed to hand over the so-called black boxes for months, but now says it will send them to France on July 20.

Global Affairs Canada spokesman Sylvain Leclerc did not directly respond to questions about the civil aviation's report, and instead pointed to Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne's past calls for Iran to conduct a full and transparent investigation.

Canada will continue to actively work with its international partners to hold the Iranian regime to account and to ensure Iran follows through on its commitments,"" Leclerc said in a statement.

""Canada and its partners will continue working to ensure transparency, accountability, justice, compensation and closure for the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy.""

The mural was done by Amos Kajner-Nonnekes of DESIGN, et cetera and his team.

“It adds a little pop of colour and whimsy to Old Strathcona,” said Kajner-Nonnekes. “We kind of specialize in enhancing spaces and turning spaces into people-friendly spaces through a little bit of urban design, some public art”

The mural is a reference to the classic, and infamous, Rainbow Road level in Mario Kart, something Kajner-Nonnekes wanted to evoke with the design.

“It’s that new whimsical level and it’s colourful and poppy and so cool. We wanted to bring that experience to Whyte Avenue.”

It occupies the Spur Line Alley north of Whyte Avenue between 104 Street and 105 Street.

“Something you don’t see very often is a mural on the ground, you can kind of walk through and see yourself going down this rainbow road,” said Kajner-Nonnekes.

The alley was originally changed from a parking area for vehicles to a public plaza by the city as part of the Whyte Ave Alley Project.

The city previously had some designs on the ground in the alley but they “didn’t really fill out the roadway” according to Kajner-Nonnekes.

The project took around 35 gallons of paint to complete and was delayed because of the uncertain Edmonton weather.

“We’ve been painting for the last 36 hours… my back and knees are sore but it’s been great.”

Kajner-Nonnekes also said that this project will be good for Whyte Avenue as people start to venture out again during the pandemic.

“Adding all this colour and all this space it really invited people in and invites them to experience Whyte Avenue in a safe and distanced way and have a new experience.”

The new mural was commissioned by the Old Strathcona Business Association and is something that Kajner-Nonnekes said has the Whyte Avenue feel.

“It’s always something a little weird, a little whimsical, and to come around the corner and see this magnificent pop of colour in an alleyway, something so Old Strathcona about that and so special.”",[],342,0.9851314910737086

Construction started in the fall of 2019 and is expected to be completed in the fall of 2022.

The project will add one lane of traffic in each direction as well as two noise walls.

The approximately 18 k.m. stretch being developed is between Gateway Boulevard and just north of Whitemud Drive.

“Depending on the section of the roadway they say there’s 60,000 vehicles a day but as high as 80,000,” said Darrell Trapp the project director with Carmacks. “I’ve even heard as high as 100,000 a day depending on the time of year and the section of roadway.”

Work requiring lane closure is being done at night to minimize the impact to traffic according to Trapp.

“Those works usually start after eight o’clock and we’ll have the roadway cleaned up and clear by before six o’clock a.m.,” said Trapp.

“Traffic counts are up so it’s a little bit more of a challenge to again work, accessing and egressing onto the Henday and you know keeping our guys safe with all this traffic.”

Trapp said there have been some incidents where barriers have been struck. Recent rainfall has also had an impact on work, but Trapp said the construction schedule isn’t “in jeopardy yet.”

“We anticipated being a lot further along with the roadworks than we are today.”

In the next few months Trapp expects there to be a third, new, driving lane available for northbound traffic.

“The northbound lanes literally could be put into service once the paint lines all the signs and everything are put up.”

Following that, crews would begin work on the southbound lanes, bridgework will continue throughout the winter.

“When we do the concrete deck overlays the traffic will all be put onto one bridge so both directions will be put onto the sister bridge,” said Trapp.

“Truck loads and the cars actually do flex the bridges and so the bridges bounce in a sense and that would weaken the concrete when it’s curing.”

More information on timeline goals is available on the Carmacks website.

It says the investigation will help determine if Alberta is adequately equipped to deal with a second wave of coronavirus, should one occur in Canada.

""A strong, coordinated response can help save lives, prevent wide-scale spread of disease and help jobs and the economy bounce back more quickly,"" the province says in a release.

The review is expected to look at:

Health system response

Economic response

Governance and decision-making

Procurement

Engagement with other governments and stakeholders

Communications

The government says the review will be similar in nature to the ones performed in response to the 2016 Horse River fire in Fort McMurray, the 2013 floods in southern Alberta and the 2011 Slave Lake fire.

Alberta NDP welcomes review

The Alberta NDP was glad to hear of the government's plans to conduct an independent review of the COVID-19 response but reiterated calls for public officials to answer questions about a number of outbreaks in Alberta.

It has sought answers from Premier Jason Kenney, Health Minister Tyler Shandro, Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer, Labour Minister Jason Copping as well as those in charge of companies and long-term care facilities where outbreaks occurred.

""This review must include accountability to the public,"" said NDP health critic David Shepherd in a release. ""The premier, his ministers, CEOs, all of them, must be subject to public questioning.

""The bottom line is the review of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be done behind closed doors.""

The deadline for submissions is Aug. 10 and a successful candidate is expected to be chosen by Aug. 19 so the results can be completed by the fall.

While the daily case count announcements from provincial health authorities are the most eye-catching figures, there's other important numbers beyond newly confirmed cases, including hospitalizations and testing data.

This page will be updated daily as new information on Alberta, Canada and international cases of COVID-19 is made available.

Starting the week of June 29, the province will provide daily data updates Monday through Friday and not on weekends and holidays.

Follow the links below or scroll down to see how the COVID-19 situation is changing in Alberta as the pandemic continues.

HOW IS COVID-19 GROWING IN ALBERTA?

The province's daily case count announcement is among the most prominent COVID-19 statistics.

The number of new cases represents the number of patients who are newly infected with the coronavirus. The number of active cases in the province can go up or down depending on the number of new recoveries on a given day.

The above graph divides active cases into those who are sick, but not in hospital, and those patients requiring hospitalization. Hospitalized patients are further divided by those getting care in and out of intensive care units.

Recoveries are defined by Alberta Health Services as follows:

A return to health after 14 days of isolation for those with COVID-19 but who experienced only mild symptoms.

If hospitalized due to COVID-19, anyone who does not require additional hospitalization or treatment in the 10 days after they left the hospital.

If tested, such as a health care worker, two negative tests at least 24 hours apart.

Daily case counts include both lab-confirmed and probable cases. The case count for a given day is sometimes revised to more accurately reflect probable cases that were either later confirmed or determined not to be related to COVID-19.

WHERE IS COVID-19 HITTING ALBERTA THE HARDEST?

Since early April, the province has provided a geographic breakdown for both its five health zones as well as individual cities and community-level subzones within those cities.

Alberta Health Services divides the province into five health zones: Calgary, Central, Edmonton, North and South.

A map of those zones can be seen here, and it's important to note that the Edmonton and Calgary zones cover an area significantly bigger than the cities they are named after.

Sizable daily jumps in the new number of cases can't necessarily be attributed to the virus growing, as testing volume and reporting time also influence the data.

For more local data, the province's COVID-19 statistics page has an interactive map showing cases by city and community.

HOW MANY COVID-19 PATIENTS ARE IN HOSPITAL?

Tracking hospitalizations is an important indicator of how severely pandemic is affecting Albertans as well as how the coronavirus is taxing the province's health care system.

Alberta has the capacity for 295 intensive care unit beds and nearly 8,500 total beds, according to the province's modelling released in April.

So far, the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions have both remained well below those maximum capacities.

Hospitalization data is often retroactively updated by the province as individual hospitals report data at varying times and speeds.

HOW IS ALBERTA TESTING FOR COVID-19?

Alberta has been the top province in Canada measured by per capita COVID-19 testing since near the start of the pandemic.

The province has now administered more than 500,000 tests Albertans.

It's important to distinguish between test volume (number of tests completed) and number of people tested as patients can be tested more than once.

The province has made seven notable shifts in testing policy.

March 23: The province announced testing was being focused on at-risk populations and health care workers. At the same time, testing returning travellers was deprioritized to only those showing symptoms.

April 7: Testing is opened to any symptomatic individuals in the Calgary Zone, which had seen significant spikes in cases in March and April.

April 13: Testing was expanded to any Albertan with symptoms consistent with the coronavirus.

April 17: The province announced it would start testing all staff and residents of continuing care facilities for COVID-19 regardless of whether or not they show symptoms.​

May 4: The testing criteria was expanded again to include anyone exeperiencing headache, muscle or joint aches, fatigue or severe exhaustion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, unexplained loss of appetite, loss of sense of smell or taste, or pink eye.

May 11: The province opened testing to asymptomatic residents of the Calgary zone who work outside their home. Testing is to be done on a first-come, first-serve basis for up to 1,000 asymptomatic residents each day. The policy was in place until May 18.

May 29: The province announces all Albertans, including those who are asymptomatic, were eligible to be tested.

HOW IS COVID-19 BEING SPREAD IN ALBERTA?

The province divides the ways COVID-19 is being spread into three categories: travel-related cases, spread via a known source, and spread via an unknown source, or community transmission.

Initially, travel-related cases were responsible for many of Alberta's new COVID-19 cases. But since travel restrictions came into effect, the number of travel-related cases has largely flattened since early April.

Close contact with individuals known to be carrying the virus remains the most common way of spreading COVID-19 in Alberta.

Suspected community transmitted cases, where the carrier isn't immediately known, are an important indicator of how the coronavirus is spreading in a community as well as how successful measures like physical distancing have been in limiting transmission.

Identified cases are investigated by AHS and classified into one of the three categories. The classification can change pending further investigation.

WHICH AGE GROUPS HAVE BEEN MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO COVID-19?

Since the onset of the pandemic, COVID-19 has affected the elderly more than other age groups as seen in high death and active case counts.

But, younger age groups are not immune, and by mid-June, cases among Albertans under the age of 40 had risen to form a majority of all active cases in the province.

HOW DOES COVID-19'S GROWTH IN ALBERTA COMPARE TO ELSEWHERE?

Conclusions drawn from comparing provinces are somewhat limited by widely differing testing volumes and practices among provinces, but the raw data does allow from some contrast.

The above graphs rank provinces by the number of tests they administer and how many confirmed cases they have, both adjusted to per 10,000 population of their respective province.

Tests are also not without their own biases. More tests will produce more positives, and it's easier to test everyone in a less populous province.

Rates adjusted for population provide a snapshot of the COVID-19 situation on any given day, but experts say the growth of the virus, which is unrelated to population size, is also an important indicator of future trends.

Alberta Health Services divides Edmonton up into 15 health subzones named for their home communities.

Since early April, the province has provided daily updates on the number of COVID-19 active cases, recoveries and deaths in each of those subzones as well as totals for the city itself.

This page is divided up into four sections: overall city data, subzone (community) level data, testing data and methodology.

Scroll down or follow the links below to navigate to each section.

CITY OF EDMONTON

The city of Edmonton is distinct from the Edmonton zone, which includes communities far beyond the city itself. You can see a map displaying the boundaries of the five AHS health zones across the province here.

Unless otherwise specifically indicated, numbers on this page are for the city itself and not the zone.

See the methodology section below for how a recovery from COVID-19 is defined by AHS.

COMMUNITIES

The 15 Edmonton AHS subzones cover the vast majority, though not all, of the area inside the city's coroporate boundaries.

You can see a rough map of the subzones below. For a zoomable version, visit the province's interactive data site and click on the geospatial tab.

Scroll down or follow these links to find data on each individual subzone:

Abbottsfield, Bonnie Doon, Castle Downs

Mill Woods South & East, Mill Woods West, Northeast

Northgate, Rutherford, Twin Brooks

West Jasper Place, Woodcroft East, Woodcroft West

Beaumont, Devon & Leduc, Fort Saskatchewan St. Albert, Sherwood Park, Stony Plain & Spruce Grove

TESTING DATA

Testing data for specific cities isn't yet available so these graphs display data from the Edmonton Zone as opposed to the city itself.

The Edmonton Zone had a population of just over 1.4 million people in 2018, according to AHS. The same year, the province estimated the city of Edmonton's population at just over 1 million people.

METHODOLOGY

Boundaries

The graphs above were assembled using two versions of the province's interactive data map, each with different borders.

The city-specific graphs draws data from the city of Edmonton as defined by its geographic corporate boundaries.

The community-level graphs draw data taken from the province's 15 Edmonton-area health subzones.

Their boundaries closely resemble the city's borders but with some exceptions. As a result, some areas within Edmonton's corporate boundaries, largely near the city's southern boundary, are included in suburban health zones.

Cases are attributed to the subzone of a patient’s primary residence. You can see population estimates for each subzone here.

Case Counts

The updated daily case count reflects the number of new, active cases (people who are now newly ill with COVID-19).

The daily change in active cases are determined by subtracting the number of newly recovered cases from the number of new cases. A positive value represents an increase in net active cases, with a negative value indicating the opposite.

The province often revises data, and reclassifies cases to other health zones or subzones which can cause a sudden rise or drop in cases for a given location.​

Reclassifications can occur for a number of reasons, including:

A patient's contact information was updated to reflect his or her proper address.

Further testing revealed a patient did not, in fact, contract COVID-19.

Data entry errors.

The province published new numbers daily March, April, May and June, with subzone data being available since early April. Starting the weekend of July 4, the province will release updated data on weekdays only, with no scheduled updates on holidays and weekends.

BOB AND DOUG MCKENZIE SCULPTURE

From your television screen to a bench in Ice District, Bob and Doug McKenzie are now in Edmonton for good.

The sculpture of Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas pays tribute to the sketch comedy duo's Great White North segment that had a memorable run on Second City Television in the 70s and 80s.

Edmonton sculptor Ritchie Velthuis made the piece that appeared in Ice District, in 103 Street and 103 Avenue, in late March.

SPIRIT OF STANLEY

Edmonton has had a lot of Stanley Cups over the year, and while this one wasn't won on the ice, it's by far the biggest and most prominent.

Located in front of the United Cycle on Gateway Boulevard, the Spirit of Stanley is the world's largest Stanley Cup replica at four metres and 850 pounds.

Fun fact: Each team took 45 minutes to engrave, according to its maker, IMARK.

NEON SIGN MUSEUM

An Edmonton classic, the Neon Sign Museum tells parts of the city's history in an artistic and bright way.

The City of Edmonton has collected 20 signs, restored and installed them on the Telus building and Mercer Warehouse on 104 Street.

Neon signs include the Canadian National Railway, the Princess Theatre, and with the goal of collecting 30 signs, there is a petition to save and move the Western Cycle sign there.

HIGH LEVEL BRIDGE AND WALTERDALE BRIDGE

These two are just nice to look at, especially at night. The City of Edmonton often changes the High Level Bridge's lights in the morning and night to celebrate certain occasions, or to send a message of solidarity as it did recently with Nova Scotia.

The Walterdale Bridge has only been around for three years but it's already arguably Edmonton's No. 1 spot for photos, featuring the breathtaking architecture, the river valley, and downtown Edmonton's growing skyline.

Gallery: Walterdale Bridge

KEILLOR POINT

Keillor Point was known as the End of the World before the City of Edmonton overhauled the North Saskatchewan River viewpoint in 2019.

The End of the World, located in the Belgravia neighbourhood, had become a safety hazard due to slumping in the embankment and deterioration of the pillars, the city said.

Still, it was a popular place to hang out and take pictures of the river, so the city spent $1.5 million to make it safer and more accessible, with stairs and a pathway.

BELGRAVIA BENCHES

Near Keillor Point, these benches in the Belgravia Dog Park are a cool spot to catch a sunset with views that include Fox Drive, the Whitemud Equine Learning Centre Association, Quesnell Bridge, the river — and your dog.

TALUS DOME

Explore Edmonton calls the Talus Dome Edmonton's ""most provocative piece of public art"" that ""always has people talking.""

You've probably driven by the 1,000 steel balls while crossing the Quesnell Bridge and raised an eyebrow, but the city encourages Edmontonians to take a closer look.

""Think fun house meets the compound eye of a fly,"" Explore Edmonton said. ""You can capture some pretty warped and funny reflections that will have you busting a gut laughing.""

Just don’t throw paint on it.

FORT EDMONTON FOOTBRIDGE

A footbridge on what feels like the middle of nowhere connects neighbourhoods in southwest Edmonton divided by the North Saskatchewan River.

Sit on the benches on and surrounding the bridge for up-close views of the river, or exercise on the trails on either side or the Wolf Willow Stairs just steps away.

""If you choose the latter, be prepared to sweat it out and hike up 200 stairs to get to this vantage point,"" Explore Edmonton said.

RIVER VALLEY SWING

As if it wasn't clear Edmonton's river valley was full of fun and surprises: a wooden swing overlooking downtown Edmonton.

It's been called a hidden gem and picturesque, but not many people know where it is. It's not clear who built it and put it there — the mystery adding to the charm.

It's tucked under somewhere around Dawson Park.

Tell your friends…unless you want it all to yourself.

WHITEMUD CREEK UNDERPASS

This is another gem not a lot of people have known about until now.

Underneath the Whitemud Creek on Anthony Henday Drive is an archway that wraps around a footbridge.

And since it doesn’t get a lot of foot traffic, it's turned into a lot more than that.

The little underpass has turned into a colourful retreat covered in graffiti and photographers admiring the rugged beauty.

“I come here a lot,” one passerby told CTV News. “It's pretty nice.”

The Whitemud Creek arch was once a site for coal mining.

In 2005 the province added the pedestrian bridge as a means for people to safely traverse from one side of the freeway to the other. Below the bridge is the creek which allows wildlife to also make the safe trek.

Local blogger Lincoln Ho believes the project is incomplete and unsafe.

""Crumbling infrastructure is always an issue especially underneath one of the busiest roadways in the city,"" said Ho.

He believes that because of very little foot traffic, “urban explorers” are taking part in extensive and often profane graffiti tagging.

“They're climbing on to parts of the bridge that aren't for pedestrians,” says Ho. “Somebody is going to get hurt and it's very hard to access for medical personnel.""

The crossing has also become a popular backdrop for social media posts, increasing its notoriety.

""So anybody who has featured this bridge on a TikTok has gotten very popular with it and so everybody is copying everybody else’s TikTok's and checking out this supposed hidden bridge.""

Neither end of the bridge is connected by trail, making it difficult to access. Still, that isn’t stopping admirers from making the trek to this urban escape.

""I actually have a friend from Toronto coming to visit and I'm going to bring her here,"" said one woman out for a hike.

""It's a beautiful piece of infrastructure,” said Ho. “Beautiful contemporary architecture style in there and it is a shame that it's just left abandoned.”",[],274,0.9879943193595282

“There is a big deficit in terms of funding from the provincial health care authorities. In some provinces, you may get some funding for treatment. In others, there is none at all,” he said.

Merrell said that sleep apnea affects 10 to 12 million Canadians, but almost 90 per cent of people are undiagnosed. A recent study has suggested that those with the condition are more susceptible to more dangerous cases of COVD-19.

“We're trying to deal with the COVID situation of course and all these things,” said Merrell. “If we can now start to suggest to individuals with sleep apnea that they have to be even more careful, then that's an important message we should try to get out""

Merrell is hoping that his ride encourages provincial governments to increase funding into sleep apnea.

Although sleep apnea is a relatively new condition, it affects people of all ages and genders – not just older males. Merrell reported even some young children have been diagnosed.

“People with sleep apnea have five to seven times greater risk of having an automobile accident,” he said.

Snoring and being chronically tired are the most common symptoms of sleep apnea. Dr. Merrell encourages people who experience those symptoms, or who are more than 40 years old, to get tested for the condition.",[],275,0.9782532552015369

Gilmer, 26 at the time, had just become the president of the Saskatchewan Coalition Against Racism.

“Well I certainly remember the siege on Kanesatake took place and almost instantly, there was organizing going on in the community to respond,” he said.

July 11, 2020 marks the 30-year anniversary of the beginning of the Oka Crisis, between the town of Oka and the Mohawk of Kanesatake.

During the conflict, people of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous backgrounds would gather at Victoria Park in Regina at what was called the Friends of Mohawk camp.

The camp became the hub for supporters in the city.

Demonstrations and rallies were held almost every day for more than two months in the park, in front of the government building on Scarth Street and at the legislature. Protesters occupied the Northern and Indigenous Affairs office for multiple days.

“People felt it was really important that a stand was taken locally in collaboration with numerous protests across the country,” said Gilmer.

For Danielle Ewenin, she had become the first Indigenous person to be the president of the University of Regina Students’ Union prior to the events of 1990.

“For me it was a struggle,” said Ewenin. “Holding that kind of profile meant also how our people were going to be perceived.”

Ewenin now works with the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women commission.

“People were afraid that if they didn’t do something and the police or armed forces did something to hurt the people in Kahnawake and Kanesatake,” said Ewenin. “People felt they had to do something to prevent that. They understood the oppression. They might not have the language for it, but they knew in [their hearts] what was happening. That made people move.”

Gilmer spoke often at rallies that summer.

“Say no to constitutional deals that ignore the first peoples,” he said in 1990. “No to golf courses that take precedence over land claim settlements.”

Gilmer, reflecting on the past, said it certainly was about more than a golf course.

“It was about the colonial history of Canada,” he said. “It was about the need for this country to come to terms with its past and find ways to move forward.”

In a Regina city council meeting in the summer of 1990, some councillors wanted the city to express its support for the Mohawks. However, most of the council voted against it.

“They didn’t want to deal with those motions because they would have to make a statement on where they stand,” said Ewenin to the press following the meeting.

She now says Canada was not ready for an Indigenous movement at the time.

“No, they weren’t ready for it. People were speaking out against the oppression,” she said.

Gilmer believes there was a societal shift that saw many non-Indigenous peoples join in the advocacy for Indigenous rights.

“It was ultimately an anti-colonial movement that was led by Indigenous people across the country, but there was many non-Indigenous people that became involved,” he said.

The actions of those who rallied still echo today.

For instance, people involved in the Black Lives Matter movement have been rallying to address racism and seek justice.

“I see it as a continuation of what was going on,” said Ewenin.

Gilmer said 1990 feels a lot like 2020.

“But on the one hand, the issues have never gone away but they seem to have risen to the forefront again,” he said.

Gilmer says the issues of police accountability and systemic discrimination were at the core of the rallies of 1990, just as they are today.

“Unfortunately, so many of those anti-racism issues we were dealing with in 1990 are still prominent today,” said Gilmer. “The difference today is that these issues can’t be swept under the rug anymore. 1990 was an important step in that direction.”

For Ewenin, her children and grandchildren are still fighting what she fought 30 years ago.

“I don’t think it’s fair. I don’t think it is right or just in this society,” said Ewenin. “They have a right to be able to pursue their lives.”

Gilmer said he thought attitudes would have changed by now.

“But it is inspiring to see so many young people today that are challenging institutional racism,” he said.

Similar movements saw education as the key to change. Ewenin thinks a shift in Canada’s way of looking at Indigenous people starts with education.

“We have a whole education system that is built on lies,” said Ewenin. “It has to be based upon Indigenous people’s stories and history. When you are taught those things, you realize we have a right to the land.”

Gilmer sees the events of the summer of 1990 as the spark to a societal shift in Canada.

“I think it really is pivotal in terms of Canadian history that those acts of solidarity, particularly the focus on Kanesatake, meant that Indigenous rights and anti-colonial struggle became front and centre for the first time,” he said.

Ewenin said Canada has a long way to go before these matters can be resolved.

“It's been 30 years since the royal commission and none of those reports have gone into change,” said Ewenin. “We are a country that has the most racist legislation and Canada is saying, ‘well, we can’t change it to fit the United Nations’ Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.”

Ewenin is optimistic about the future generations and their fight against injustices.

“As long as people feel their rights are not being acknowledged - that’s not a struggle or a fight that’s going to be given up. My grandchildren have inherited that. It’s not going to go away,” she said.

“Canada will get there.”",[],919,0.9527371138320787

The next few days will be a great opportunity to enjoy some time outdoors because the weekend ahead is expected to leave plenty to be desired. So does today, for that matter:

Monday, too, lacks the ""get up and go"" of our midweek. That’s a by-product of the back-end of a trough, one which created some nasty weather through parts of the province. Much more on that when we get to the photos – there were some great ones sent by!

Digressing back into our day ahead, scattered thundershowers may trigger along the foothills and roll in late this afternoon or into the evening. Because we’re a touch cooler today, we expect these to be largely non-severe, save for the southern fringes of Alberta, where conditions may be warmer.

For our Tuesday to Thursday, we’re falling back into some westerly wind, and we’re diving back beneath the jet; the jet fences cold air in the north, but as part of this trough, it’s dug in beneath us, which keeps today 5° below our seasonal normal, as noted at 23° in our Day-Lites. When the jet migrates along with this deep trough and ascends back north of us, it allows for warmer air to circulate in, and we’ll see conditions return to normal, and to more stable straits, as well.

Here’s the forecast:

Today:

Partly cloudy, chance of afternoon thundershowers

Daytime high: 18°

Evening: partly cloudy, storm risk, low 8°

Tomorrow:

Mainly cloudy, scattered showers possible

Daytime high: 22°

Evening: mainly clear, low 11°

Wednesday:

Partly cloudy

Daytime high: 21°

Evening: mainly clear, low 10°

Thursday:

Mainly sunny

Daytime high: 25°

Evening: clear, low 11°

Friday:

Showers

Daytime high: 18°

Evening: clear, low 10°

Today’s photos only tell half of Sunday's story. We’ll look north, first, to the warned storms that ripped through yesterday and produced nickel-to-quarter-sized hail through Innisfail, Caroline, Olds, and areas west of Sundre, as well as gusts in Brooks and Priddis in the 80 km/h range. A series of funnel clouds were also being watched.

Speaking of, one of the funnel clouds looks to have touched down near Nanton. Environment Canada says that it’s received a preliminary rating of EF-0 as a landspout tornado, which is an accurate rating given the photographs show a surface dust cloud, but little to no connection otherwise.

As per NHL rules, each team is allowed to bring a cohort of 52 people to the hub city comprised of various trainers, medical staff, coaches and 28 total players.

The Flames currently have 35 players on their roster including four goalies, 11 defencemen and 20 forwards.

The players and coaches were separated into two groups for Monday’s on-ice session. The first group took to the ice at 10:00 a.m. while the second group takes the ice at 12:15 p.m. to wrap up the practice.

General Manager Brad Treliving says his club is as locked down as much as possible right now as management works to keep everyone in the same bubble and virus-free.

Canmore RCMP, along with Kananaskis Public Safety and Kananaskis Emergency Services, were called to an area near Mount Yamnuska for reports a hiker had fallen.

The report indicated the 30-year-old man from Calgary was hiking in the scree section of the trail at about 2:10 p.m. Saturday when he fell approximately six metres.

While the injured male was being helped by a number of bystanders, several boulders came free from the slope and fell down on top of them.

The victim suffered a head injury as a result. The bystanders remained at the scene and administered first aid until help arrived.

Crews from both Alpine Helicopters and STARS Air Ambulance attended the scene but, unfortunately, the man died of his injuries.

The victim's identity is not being released as officials are notifying family.

""Unfortunately (Saturday) at Yamnuska was very busy for first responders,"" said Cpl. Sabrina Clayton of the Canmore RCMP detachment.

TWO OTHERS INJURED ON THE SCREE SLOPE

Leaders from the mountain climbing community say the section of trail is notoriously tricky if not treacherous.

""Injuries and accidents on Yamnuska go back as far as people have been heading up there to hike and climb,"" said Brandon Pullan, editor-in-chief of Gripped magazine.

""There’s no denying it, there’s a lot that can go wrong. It just takes one loose rock or a foot to slip. But if you are in the climbing or the mountain community, you should be prepared to lose people.""

RECENT FATALITIES

At the end of June a woman died in a fall on nearby Mount Fable.

Trina Ramanaden is remembered by friends and family as an avid hiker.

According to Kananaskis rescue officials. helicopters spotted her body on the southeast ridge of the mountain face.

Charles Mark, a resident of the nearby Stoney Nakoda First Nation says he is saddened to learn of the recent fatal incidents and says preparation and reflection is important before any mountain experience.

""You have to respect the mountain. Before you go up the mountain always offer tobacco and pray then you go up.""

RCMP are also advising extra caution especially for novice hikers and climbers.

""When in doubt, talk to a professional if you’re unsure about what equipment you might need the route you are going to be taking and just always be prepared for unfortunately anything that can happen in the backcountry,"" said Cpl. Clayton.

Robert Curtis ""Bob"" Clark, was first elected to represent Didsbury in 1960 at the age of 23, making him the youngest MLA to serve at the time.

According to media reports, Clark passed away in Calgary late this week.

While serving in office, he was named the minister of youth under Premier Ernest Manning and then minister of education under Premier Harry Strom.

When Peter Lougheed defeated the Social Credit Party, Clark served as the leader of the Official Opposition.

He continued to serve the constituents of Olds-Didsbury until 1981.

Clark then went on to serve as Alberta's first ethics commissioner and then the first privacy and information commissioner.

Premier Jason Kenney released a statement Saturday expressing his condolences to Clark's family and gratitude for his years of public service.

""As both a government and opposition member, Bob was respected by members of all parties, and was considered a true gentleman with a real heart for public service,"" he said. ""He volunteered in countless roles, including for three terms as chairman of the board of Olds College, and chairman of the board of the Alberta Junior A Hockey League.

""On behalf of the Government of Alberta, I offer my sincere condolences to Bob Clark’s family, loved ones and friends, and the entire community of Olds at this time of loss.""

The Calgary brewery released its first sour beer this month as a celebration of 'Karen', the internet-coined name given to the stereotypical entitled, privileged white woman. The brewery's social media promotion of the beer used phrases that included 'Can we speak to a manager?' and the depiction on the label was of a fair-skinned woman with the crown of the Common Crown Brewing logo resting on her head.

The misguided attempt to be humorous drew swift criticism on social media as the name appeared to exonerate the actions of a select group who have stood in opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement.

On Friday, Common Crown announced its decision to remove the beer from store shelves and issued the following apology:

We wish to thank those who reached out and brought to our attention the error we have made in our recent release. We realize that our intent of the Karen label is insignificant at this juncture. Unfortunately, The Karen Cherry Sour missed the mark, and we promise to do better. Being tone deaf to racial developments is not an excuse, and we will work harder to stay informed and up to date on escalating situations. Thank you to those who sought to educate and inform us, and help us to recognize our error. We read through all of your comments and messages as a team. Moving forward, we will be working to do better, educate ourselves and collaborate with communities who support inclusion and diversity.

The Karen Cherry Sour has been pulled from shelves and is no longer available for sale. While this is just a small step in understanding our wrong, we are committed to moving forward and doing better.

Thank you.

CTV News reached out to the owner of Common Crown Brewing Co., Damon Moreau, for comment on the situation and he said the decision on the product name was made as a result of a team effort and the entire team apologizes for the mistake.

""We recognize the issue and the error,"" he said.

Accounting for both outbreak-related cases and non-outbreak cases, the Forest Heights/Forest Hill/Lakeside neighbourhood has the highest infection rate, at 992.9 per 100,000 people.

The Vanier/Rockway neighbourhood is next, with a rate of 945.6 cases per 100,000 people.

While both of those neighbourhoods have a high rate of outbreak-related cases, Vanier/Rockway also has the highest infection rate when adjusting for non-outbreak cases only.

Note: You can explore the map yourself by scrolling to the bottom of this article.

When looking at only non-outbreak cases, that neighbourhood has an infection rate of 260.2 per 100,000 people, with 41 cases.

Woolwich Rural North also has one of the highest rates of infection rate, with 212.9 infections per 100,000 people. There are 15 non-outbreak cases there.

The neighbourhood with the third-highest infection rate is Southwest Kitchener. There, the rate is 190.4 per 100,000 people.

Public health officials have reported 39 non-outbreak cases there, and 62 total cases.

On the region's website, officials note that the data is skewed because of previous testing guidance that prioritized certain groups.

The website also notes that, just because your neighbourhood may look okay on the map, it doesn't mean you're safe.

""There is broad circulation of COVID-19 in our community. You should assume you could get COVID-19 anywhere in Waterloo Region,"" the region's website notes.

Several neighbourhoods on the map are considered not reportable because they have five cases or fewer.

The data also shows that five cases have invalid or missing postal codes.

Since the pandemic began, there have been 1,299 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Waterloo Region. That includes 1,094 resolved cases and 116 deaths.

Region of Waterloo CAO Mike Murray reported the charges on Tuesday during one of the region's twice-weekly media briefing.

The charges were laid between June 23 and June 29 at a private residence in Waterloo and another in Kitchener.

In both cases, Murray says that more than 10 people were gathered.

""The emergency orders are still in effect, they are still being enforced, and the emergency orders do limit public gatherings to less than 10 people,"" he reminded the public during the briefing.

""I just encourage everybody to take the emergency orders seriously and take their personal precautions seriously.""

Over the weekend, the Ontario government extended its emergency orders until July 15.

Murray said during the briefing that the rules will continue to be enforced on Canada Day, when many people will be off work and may want to celebrate.

When asked whether these gatherings had anything to do with the situation where London party-goers had come to Waterloo Region, Murray said that the incidents were unrelated.

During the same time period when these charges were laid, enforcement officials had 142 site visits where they educated people about the emergency orders.

They also had 154 site visits where no action was required.

With these charges, the total now sits at 23 given out since the pandemic began.

Murray has said previously that in most cases, the fine would be given to the person facilitating the breaking of the emergency order, meaning the tenant or homeowner.

North, which started as Thalmic Labs in 2012, announced the news alongside a Google announcement on June 30.

The company started with a focus on a device called Myo, a gesture-based device that strapped onto a user's forearm and allowed them to compute with their movements.

North then shifted its focus to Focals smart glasses, which the company says it will be winding down after the acquisition.

The company unveiled the product back in October of 2018, two years after receiving US$120 million in funding from investors like Amazon and Intel.

At one point the company had some 400 employees, but in February of 2019 it announced it was downsizing, something a Communitech spokesperson said at the time was ""not uncommon"" for a young company.

In its announcement, Google's Senior Vice President of Devices and Services, Rick Osterloh, says the decision was made to help it work towards ""ambient computing.""

CTV News reported earlier this month dozens of people were forced from homes in the area due to concern over the dam’s potential failure. The dam is located at Lake Wahtopanah on the Little Saskatchewan River.

In a news release on Monday, the province said it conducted onsite investigations using probes and water level monitoring to determine the safety of the dam.

Infrastructure Minister Ron Schuler said in a news release that people can now return home.

“The engineering assessment based on current conditions shows no substantial amount of damage to the dam from record flows over the past two weeks,” he said.

Record rains earlier this month caused high water levels on the Little Saskatchewan River, which impacted the following municipalities: Riverdale, Whitehead, Cornwallis, and the City of Brandon.

Staff at the Manitoba Emergency Measures Organization will contact municipalities about safe-return procedures.

The province noted it will still monitor the dam 24 hours a day until water levels have gone down. It also urges that all use of Lake Wahtopanah be suspended until the water recedes further.

According to Rachel Rusen, Manitoba film commissioner and CEO of Manitoba Film and Music, the province’s low case numbers have made it possible for the industry to resume operations - granted it follows the necessary public health restrictions.

The first productions that are getting back to work are documentaries and TV movies, as they require smaller crews.

“This enables our Manitoba producers to implement the new protocols and have our Manitoba crews adapt to them first before scaling up to larger productions,” Rusen said in a statement.

As of last week, there were six shows in production in Manitoba, though two of these were feature animations that continued working throughout the pandemic.

Rusen noted some of the documentaries that have returned to production include: Science Fiction Makers, Dying to be Famous, and March of the Polar Bears.

Last Wednesday, July 8, marked the first day that crews started filming live-action scripted productions since the start of the pandemic, with the TV movie, called ‘A Secret to Keep.’

Rusen said there were also three projects in pre-production, also known as prep, last week.

“During prep is when a production office is opened; crews are hired; schedules are made; actors are cast; locations are scouted, permits obtained, equipment ordered, the costume department designs and builds wardrobe, the art department develops the look of the show that includes sets and props along with building any necessary sets,” she said.

Two of these projects are made-for-TV movies that will begin filming this week, and a feature film that is in prep for the summer.

HOW THE FILM INDUSTRY IS ADAPTING

Rusen said that even though things are resuming, the film industry has had to make adjustments. This includes hiring additional cleaners, bringing in health monitors for temperature checks, changing meal distribution plans, and limiting access to sets.

“Social distancing means shooting will likely take longer and that costs more; however that is the cost of being safe and being able to resume work,"" she said. ""The Manitoba film industry is committed to a safe and responsible return to production.”

Producer Cary Davis with Van Evera Productions, the company producing ‘A Secret to Keep’ along with production partner Neshama, said the biggest challenge was planning out how they would return for their first day of filming, because they managed to complete their prep while working from home.

“We drafted a set of protocols for working on set and shared this with all the different departments to get their input along with a registered nurse whom has extensive experience in a number of specialties including management of Intensive Care Units,” he said in a statement, noting that after a couple days of shooting things were going smoothly with the safety plan on set.

Davis added the COVID-19 pandemic has had a financial impact on the industry, as the public health protocols have created added costs.

“The biggest impact has been somewhat financially as these protocols do lead to significant extra expenses compared to pre- COVID filming,” he said.

“We all care a great deal about coming back to work safely and I’m happy that my partners in producing this project all came to the table to ensure we did so correctly.”

Arnie Zipursky, co-founder and producer for Neshama Entertainment ULC, said an “enormous” amount of thought and time has gone into what a safe set will look like.

“Manitoba has led Canada and our industry to be one of the safest locations in the world as the production community now commences since the pandemic shut down,” he said.

""There is a nice size American contingent here that are here for between 2-4 years,"" said Lt.-Col. Brian Hardeman of the U.S. Air Force. ""We are embedded in the community, and we are happy to be here.""

Hardeman said American troops go to school and play organized sports alongside Canadians.

As part of a bilateral agreement, the U.S. troops get to keep their licence plates, but that's been causing problems recently.

""Some of the dependent spouses and things of that nature have gotten some profanity at local business establishments, and some have been told to go back home,"" said Hardeman.

The Lieutenant-Colonel said there have been three ""outbursts.""

There was also an incident where two cars were keyed because of their American plates.

According to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), the Americans are essential to the base and pose no risk of bringing COVID-19 into the community.

""Our American colleagues are very aware of this, and they certainly don't want to be a factor of the COVID-19 or a threat or a danger to us,"" said RCAF Col. Eric Charron, ""They wouldn't be serving in this capacity if they didn't believe that.""

NDP MP Niki Ashton and Conservative MP James Bezan wrote a letter to Bernadette Jordan, the federal Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian coast guard, to take urgent action and provide support to the fishers.

“Commercial fishers in Lake Winnipeg and across Manitoba have no opportunity for income,” said Bezan.

“There was a promise made by the federal government. Minister Jordan and Justin Trudeau promised back on May 14 that there’s going to be almost $470 million that was going to flow to our commercial fishing industry across this country. And here we are, eight weeks later and not a single dollar has left the federal treasury.”

The MPs are specifically asking for the government to:

Make the Fish Harvester Grant Benefit and Fish Harvester Grant business programs accessible to fishers;

Identify a point person in Manitoba to work directly with fishers;

Involve the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corp. (FFMC) with making the programs more accessible; and

Work with fishers to ensure supply is available for foodbanks and other organization addressing food insecurity during the pandemic.

Ashton and Bezan also want the government to direct the FFMC, which is a Crown corporation, to find new markets to move higher volumes of pickerel and whitefish.

Liberal leader Dougald Lamont said this is an issue they’ve been working on.

“As provincial Liberals we actually made sure that Manitoba was part of the fish harvesting program,” he said.

“We made sure Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation is going to be part of the federal food surplus program and we’re working with them actively to do that. That should actually mean that we could rescue the fall season.""

THE IMPACT ON MANITOBA’S FISHERS

Vince Crate, from Fish River Cree Nation, said the fishers in his community didn’t think it was feasible to go out on the lake this year due to issues regarding the expenses, demand and ability to sell the fish.

He said the demand for fish just wasn’t there this spring.

“In terms of fishing, there’s really been no fishing since the COVID crisis hit,” he said.

Crate noted the key drivers for the fishing industry are places like restaurants, which weren’t operational for much of the season.

“Fishing is the backbone of a number of First Nations and communities across our province,” said Ashton.

“This isn’t just about one fisher, it’s about their families, it’s about communities.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Office of the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard said they recognize that this will be a different year for Canadian fisheries, which is why the federal government invested more than half a billion dollars into the seafood sector in the last two months through the Canadian Seafood Stabilization Fund, The Fish Harvester Benefit, and the Fish Harvester Grant.

The statement added they recognize harvesters’ earnings still might not be enough to establish a valid claim for Employment Insurance Fishing Benefits for the coming year, so they are allowing self-employed fish harvesters and sharepersons to establish a claim for EI Fishing Benefits based on insurable benefits in previous years.

“On May 20th Minister Jordan met with MP Ashton to discuss the concerns of Manitoba fish harvesters directly,” the statement said.

“The MP also sent a letter which received a detailed reply, again emphasizing that Manitoba commercial harvesters were eligible for the benefits our government has introduced in response to COVID-19. Manitoba fishers are not and have never been excluded from our support measures. The response also confirmed that FFMC will continue to provide vital support to its clients, and has committed to providing updates to harvesters on how its services will respond to EI changes in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Shaw said so far the city has recalled almost 700 workers and the remaining jobs are transit and community service staff.

The city said in late July and early August, all library branches will partially reopen, except for the Cornish Library, which is currently closed for renovations. The libraries will be open for holds pick-up service, phone reference service and to return borrowed library materials. The city will announce reopening dates and hours of operation in the coming weeks.

For those who are wondering when full services will resume, Shaw said there is no confirmed date for that yet.

""What we're trying to do is balance out the needs for safety of our staff and the public,"" said Shaw. ""I will strongly encourage you to continue to think about the new normal. Based on public health orders and where we are going, we need to be able to monitor as we get passed the Summer and into the Fall.""

He added that with the new normal, some of the changes might be more permanent as the city moves forward.

The city will also reopen the Pan Am Pool and the Cindy Klassen Recreation Complex on July 20. The two facilities will operate with limited access to the pools, walking tracks, and fitness equipment.

For those who are concerned about how people will social distance at these areas, Shaw said staff will be there to help enforce the rules.

""On occasion, someone forgets or maybe doesn't understand the rules, the staff are trained on how to approach those situations and generally what we find is when we tell someone 'hey we want you to stand here or there is a lineup' people are more than willing to comply. Everyone's chipping in,"" said Shaw.

He added that, for the most part, Winnipeggers have been very good at following the health guidelines.

Residents will have to register for swimming and fitness blocks, similar to current rules regarding outdoor pools. Details on registration will be released closer to reopening the city said.

Shaw said it is important that people book these swim and fitness blocks.

""I continue to encourage you to pre-register to avoid disappointment at the gates if the pools are full.""",[],425,0.9547921183483931

On Friday afternoon, Coun. Sherri Rollins, along with Michael Jack, the city's Chief Corporate Services Officer, presented a motion calling for the city to use recently gifted money to build one or more public washrooms and handwashing stations.

""I also have really been struck during the pandemic on access to washroom issues,"" Rollins said. ""I know that public washrooms are absolutely something that as Winnipeggers – as Winnipeg city council – we should be able to meet the needs of life, security, and dignity.""

In early June, the city was told it had been gifted $670,000 through the COVID-19 Community Response Fund for Vulnerable Populations (CRFVP). The money came with a catch, specifying a project that would use the funding had to be selected by mid-August and completed by February 2021.

""During an emergency, during a crisis like a pandemic, a lot of things happen out of order or in a way that isn't typical and these funding opportunities certainly came to our attention in a very atypical way,"" Jack told the city's protection, community services and parks committee.

Rollins and Jack are proposing the city use $620,000 of the funding to build one or more public washrooms that would be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The location of these washrooms would be determined through consultation with End Homelessness Winnipeg and the public service.

The plan, if approved, says construction on the washrooms would be completed by February 2021.

The remaining $50,000 would be used to immediately rent temporary portable washrooms and hand washing stations in areas of the city that would best serve the homeless.

""Throughout this motion, you hear the echoed priorities of the homeless population – Winnipeg's most vulnerable – to access basic toileting facilities,"" Rollins told the committee on Friday.

""It is reflective of the point of time that we just went through, that we are likely going into again during the pandemic, on how key toilets are for residents, including those with disabilities, the necessity of toileting facilities especially in or in the vicinity of homeless encampments, and how important hand washing stations, toilets, showers, hygiene, and dignity is for residents.""

Jack told the committee there are a lot of unknown factors – including how much each unit would cost to build, but said he believes the funding would cover one to three public washrooms.

Jack said the Downtown Winnipeg BIZ estimates it would cost $12,500 annually to operate a public washroom, and said the city would look for ways to recoup that cost – suggesting sponsorships or advertising revenue.

He said as a last resort, they would need to look for funding in the city's operating budget.

""We would need to select a model that made the most sense and was hopefully the most cost-effective in terms of operating maintenance,"" he said. ""We would have to explore every single option.""

Rollins said the cost is worth it.

""There are costly consequences for public works when there are no hygiene and sanitation facilities,"" she said.

""Where homeless encampments are present, all along the riverbank, along Balmoral, has been replete with feces, urine, and rats in some cases, and that comes at a cost to not only the buildings – to schools sometimes – surrounding the riverbank, but to public works.""

The committee voted to pass the motion on Friday. It will now go to the executive policy committee for a vote before going to city council.",[],601,0.9749091990583614

The work, conducted by researchers at the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences and a virology lab at Universidad de Concepción in Chile, also found that if scientists don’t monitor how the virus is changing in different parts of the world, the testing could produce false negative results. Dr. Carlos Farkas, a postdoctoral researcher in pharmacology and therapeutics for the Max Rady College of Medicine and the Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, was the study’s lead author.

To conduct the study, the research team used datasets to look at whole genome sequencing samples from people infected before March 27 with the virus that causes COVID-19.

According to a news release from the university, this team “was the first to combine genomic sequencing data from two worldwide sources in order to detect variants by geographic region.” The group found 146 different variants.

Dr. Jody Haigh, co-author and associate professor of pharmacology and therapeutics and a senior scientist at the Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, said one of the major findings was that samples from Washington had a distinctive footprint of viral sequence changes.

“About 39 per cent of Washington State samples had this footprint. Asian and European samples were more diverse in terms of changes in viral sequence, but their footprints were clearly different from those in the U.S. samples,” Haigh said in the release.

The researchers noted when labs test for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), they use small pieces of DNA that bind to the viral sequence and amplify viral RNA/DNA.

Farkas said in order for a robust positive test result, the DNA needs to exactly match the viral sequence.

“If researchers design these primers to bind to regions of the virus that they don’t realize have changed in a particular population, there may be poor amplification and the result can be false negatives,” Farkas said.

The study did find some changes in viral sequence in regions of the virus where the DNA was supposed to bind, which could explain why there have been some false negative testing results.

“Because SARS-CoV-2 is changing rapidly, researchers should be aware of its current local viral footprints in order to design DNA primers that don’t bind to regions of the virus that have changed. Other regions of the virus that don’t show these changes should be used for designing primers,” Haigh said.

The research team hopes its work will impact COVID-19 testing and vaccine development.",[],427,0.9723579998540445

The mussels, which are considered an invasive species, were found in Sipiwesk Lake, located north of Cross Lake, and is part of the Nelson River.

The government said this is the first time the mussels have been found in the lake.

The province said zebra mussels were first found in the South Basin of Lake Winnipeg in 2013. It expected that the mussels would move down the Nelson River naturally, and therefore the province designated the area as an aquatic invasive species (AIS) control zone in 2015.

The province then announced in August 2019 that the mussels were found in the Nelson River for the first time.

At that point, officials with the province notified nearby communities and stakeholders to tell them of the discovery.

Zebra mussels can cause a variety of problems for affected bodies of water as they can impact community drinking water systems.

They can also affect boat motors and shorelines. The mussels can also have negative impacts on water-based industries such as commercial fishing, lodge operators, and local tourism.

The province said the spread of zebra mussels and other invasive species is preventable and anyone who uses the water, whether it be boaters to beachgoers, the province said they can do their part.

There are bait and decontamination requirements that are in place at AIS control zones and people with boats, including canoes and kayaks, must stop at watercraft inspection stations when they are open.

The inspection stations are open until the middle of the fall.",[],264,0.9514142353163262

“It’s probably been about a good month and half, two months now that we’ve noticed various flavors not available,” said Munther Zeid, general manager at Food Fare.

But, it’s not just pop cans.

Luke Chapman, the interim president for Beer Canada, said the COVID-19 pandemic is changing the way Canadians consume beer.

He noted bars and tap rooms normally represent 20 to 25 per cent of total Canadian beer sales, but with the pandemic those sales are down, which has increased the demand for packaging materials such as cans and bottles.

“Based on what we have heard from both brewers and manufacturers, we are not at the crisis level yet but we have heard from some brewers that they are facing challenges sourcing aluminum cans,” Chapman said.

David Kaisaris, who owns the Riverside Beer Store, said the supply of canned beverages has been impacted by more than just the pandemic.

“It’s been a particularly difficult spring and summer because first we had COVID, then we had where our major supplier had a malware problem where they had to build, rebuild their whole SAP system over again,” he said.

Moosehead Breweries is also feeling the impact -- sending CTV News this statement: “We can confirm that we are seeing pressure on our can supply due to supplier production limitations, as well as increased demand from consumers for cans, both of which are adding to existing supply chain challenges resulting from COVID-19. We are actively working with all of our suppliers to minimize stock issues and impacts on our production.”

Chapman said the United States is experiencing the same market changes as Canada.

“So there’s been an increase in the demand for aluminum cans down there as well,” he said.

“It has resulted in certain brewers having to explore some further international markets to make up for the loss of supply.”

Zeid said he hopes there will be more product soon.

“We were told that there was a shortage at the beginning and that the U.S. was not allowing the export of aluminum tins and there’s a bit of shortage here and they’re trying to find another source,” he said.

The research, conducted in partnership with the University of British Columbia, was published on Friday in the academic journal Cell Host & Microbe. It said breastfeeding directly at the breast best supports the process.

“In this study, we looked at the breast milk and the stool of mothers and babies from a large national study called the Child Study,” said Dr. Meghan Azad, an associate professor at the University of Manitoba, who is involved with the study. “We did that because we’re interested in their microbiomes, so, the bacteria that live in and on our body that do so many important things.

“We think it’s really important to understand how that gets established very early in life.”

The research found some of the bacteria present in the mother’s breast milk are also present in the child’s stool.

“It tells us that maybe those particular bacteria are especially important,” Azad said. “Maybe they would be good candidates to be probiotics, outside of this spear of mothers and babies.

“It’s interesting because we know the microbiome is really important throughout our lives, so understanding how breast milk affects this early in life is important new information.”

Azad said the early development of the bacteria could help with a child’s health as they get older.

“We’ve shown that the bacteria in the infant's gut very early on, seems to be correlated with the risk of developing allergies and asthma very early in life,” she said. “In that early window of development, babies are still developing their immune system, and we know the gut bacteria is important for training their immune system to understand what is a harmful bacteria or pathogen, and what is a helpful one.”

Azad said there are 3,500 families participating in the study, with 1,200 samples used for this section of the study. They sampled the breast milk at three months of age, and sampled the stool at the same age, and then again at one-year-old. The babies are now eight-years-old, Azad said.

“There is lots more research to do to see how what we’ve found in this first study may be impacting the health of these children as they grow up,” she said.",[],379,0.9817360861935159

In many cases in Manitoba, reporting a sexual assault needs to be done in person, but soon students attending most post-secondary schools in the province will have more control when reporting sexual violence.

Mary Lobson is the project manager of Rees – short for Respect Educate Empower Survivors – the online reporting tool for sexual violence that will be released to nine post-secondary campuses in Manitoba this fall.

""We don't require any identifying information to actually make an account or use the platform,"" Lobson told CTV News. ""The only time you need to provide information is if you are wanting to reach out and get support.""

The website is designed to put users in touch with supports and information specific to their school, and the option to share their story.

""It's really up to the survivor how much information they want to share, to whom they want to share it and at what time,"" Lobson said.

She said each term, anonymous data sets will be given to schools to provide them with concrete numbers of when and where sexual assaults are occurring.

Allison Kilgour, a law student at the University of Manitoba and the advocacy coordinator for Students for Consent Culture, says this platform is a win-win.

""It's going to provide autonomy and choice and options and support for students, and it's also going to give institutions the ability to receive and track data that they never really had the option to track before,"" Kilgour said.

Lobson said Rees will also create consistency between schools that currently use different tracking methods. She said she hopes the platform will lead to more incidents getting reported and allow survivors to report assaults on their own terms.

However, with eased restrictions the team, minus a few players caught abroad, is back on the pitch for restricted practices.

“Without contact, it's unrealistic in terms of decision making for the players, and pressure, but we are doing what we can,"" said Valour FC head coach and general manager, Robert Gale.

With only a third of the roster from the inaugural season returning for a second year with the club, the limitations have made it difficult for players to build chemistry, other than some video conference socials held during the lockdown.

""You're not obviously going to get the ball skills not playing with your teammates as much,” recently acquired midfielder, Fraser Aird said.

“But keeping yourself physically fit during the whole thing out running and stuff like that is key because we never know what's going to happen so we need to be prepared for that.""

Further to the challenge of running practices while maintaining physical distancing, is the fact that no one knows exactly what the league will decide when it comes to when, where and how it plans to forego a season, if it even does.

“What's it going to look like? Is it a tournament? Will we get any games in? All of those factors are still unknown, so I think it's been a challenge,” Gale said.

The uncertainty has challenged some players’ ability to keep focused, with no season opener in sight.

“It's probably most mental (the effects), the whole pandemic thing and getting used to it and coming back to training not knowing what the outcome is going to be or when we are going to get the call,"" Aird said about the challenges of training during the pandemic.

With no firm start date, Gale says his staff has been taking a “scientific approach” in preparing for a potential season, using a “sliding scale” to gauge how hard to push his players.

""We had one for a potential June first start, a potential July first start, and a potential August first start,” Said Gale.

After a successful first phase in its plan to return, the organization is now moving ahead with its second phase ahead of its July 1 start date.

Health and safety checklists related to COVID-19 for players, coaches, umpires, ballpark maintenance staff, as well as parents and spectators, are available on the Baseball Manitoba website. It has also created the new volunteer role of Health and Safety Coordinator which every team must have and who will attend every game to answer any questions and monitor the new regulations.

Among the new rules:

Players and coaches will need to maintain 2 meters of physical distance, including in the dugout;

Signage for physical distancing must be present at all fields;

Sanitizing areas will be established for spectators;

No chewing gum or sunflower seeds will be allowed on the premises in 2020;

Balls and equipment must be sanitized after every game; and

Facilities can operate at 50% capacity with people expected to remain two meters apart except for brief exchanges.

There are no rule changes to the game itself. Umpires can assume the traditional position behind the catcher, though, they have the option to stand 6 feet behind the catcher or behind the pitcher’s mound.

Players are encouraged to bring their own equipment, though it can be shared if it is sanitized between users.

If there happens to be an outbreak during the season, Baseball Manitoba executive director, Jason Miller, says it will be up to Manitoba Health to decide whether local leagues can move forward.

“If you’ve tested positive or have any symptoms you’re not to be at any baseball events. That’s clearly stated in our plan and on our signage,” said Miller.

“So, if that happens we will assess and we will take orders from the province as to how to proceed.”

The Winnipeg AAA league will kick off the season on July 1, with grassroots play expected to start later in July.

“They say (it’s) going from zero to sixty,” said Basketball Manitoba Executive Director, Adam Wedlake. “We’re maybe going from zero to six - it’s pretty slow.”

Last week, Canada Basketball released its latest guidelines for Canadians to return to the sport, and it most notably excludes any kind of game scenario, whether competitive or in practice.

“It’s a return to the sport, basically in a training component.” Wedlake said. “The best way to describe it is social distanced practicing.”

Players will be expected to regularly monitor themselves for any symptoms of COVID-19 and will follow several strict guidelines upon return.

Players will be expected to:

practice with no more than two people at one basket

bring their own basketball and water bottles

refrain from passing their ball to other players

maintain physical distancing between other players and coaches.

“It will basically be shooting and ball-handling, dribbling drills and skills at least for the first few months.”

Wedlake believes these measures will remain in place until at least this fall, though the plan still needs to be approved by Manitoba health officials and Sport Manitoba.

The next challenge will be securing facilities for practices. Wedlake says Basketball Manitoba is keeping an eye on what the Manitoba High School Sports Association will decide when it comes to high school basketball in the fall, as gymnasiums used for practices are in schools.

“We’re a pretty heavy school-based sport,” Wedlake said. “What’s going to happen in the school system? Will there be school teams? Will the school system allow us to rent and get into their facilities on evenings and weekends?”

Manitoba Basketball isn’t the only entity with questions. The Manitoba Association of Basketball Officials has little information on how their jobs will change when play resumes. Supervisor of operations Mike Maryk says while local referees don’t have any major concerns to this point, there is speculation among officials as to what can be expected.

“You can look at potentially wearing gloves to avoid contact and stuff like that, but of course, how we communicate is with hand signals so it would certainly bring an interesting dynamic to it,” Maryk said.

While he contends having officials wearing masks during play would be near impossible based on the fact they obligated to have a whistle in their mouth throughout the game, he also wonders how sanitizing balls will come in to play.

“Depending on the level (you officiate) you let the captains check out the ball to see what it’s like, see if they like it,"" said Maryk.

“You would hate to be like ‘ok this stoppage we are going to switch and use this ball now while the other one gets taken out’ that would be a huge determent to the game, yet I say that and it could be the rule for all I know. Who knows what the foreseeable future brings?”

Basketball Manitoba is aiming to get players back on the court under these guidelines early next month, it does not expect games to be introduced into the return plan until much further down the road. Although Wedlake says the three-on-three game, or 3x3, may return sooner as it is mostly played outdoors. However, there is no timeline for when that may happen.",[],543,0.9258697367636812

ST-APOLLINAIRE, Que. - Quebec provincial police continued their search Sunday for the father of two deceased girls who were the subject of an Amber Alert earlier this week, a case that has gripped a small town southwest of Quebec City.

The bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, were found in a wooded area of a Quebec City suburb on Saturday.

On Sunday, the manhunt for the girls' father, Martin Carpentier, 44, had authorities tightening the search in the woods.

“That's our priority now, to locate him as soon as possible,” said Sgt. Ann Mathieu, a provincial police spokeswoman.

Residents had helped with the searches until Saturday, but police asked people to stay away from the area Sunday to let police work.

“We're still asking residents to be vigilant, but the best way to help us is to take a look at their own properties,” Mathieu said.

The provincial police have been omnipresent since Thursday, when the Amber Alert was triggered. The search shifted to a manhunt Saturday after the bodies of the two young sisters from Levis, Que. were found.

The attention of the entire province has been on the case, especially in the town of just over 6,000 where it's playing out.

Police have transformed the parking lot of a community centre into a base of operations and helicopters have been taking off and landing at a nearby soccer field.

Cedric Lambert, a native of St-Apollinaire, which is about a 30-minute drive from Quebec City, said he never imagined he'd see this type of deployment in his quiet little corner of the province.

“Seeing police everywhere, helicopters, you wouldn't have believed it,” Lambert, 23, said. “Then to know that they found the little girls here is stressful.”

His partner, Marie-Myriam Dion, a mother of two, said she doesn't feel safe.

“I can't wait for them to find him,” she said. “I lock my doors at home as soon as I am alone.”

Lambert was concerned Carpentier could represent a danger, given he's been missing since Wednesday and couldn't very well return to town to buy food.

One local described the area as a prime hiding spot.

Gerald Rousseau, a St-Apollinaire resident for 40 years, lives about four kilometres from where the police are searching. He said there's plenty of places to hide in the densely forested area.

“There are plenty of small chalets around there, cabins, sugar shacks, trailers,” Rousseau said. “It's a good place to hide ... people come down on the weekends, but there aren't a lot of people coming down given what's happening, so there's often food left behind inside.”

He also did as police asked and surveyed his own property.

“I turned my own property over, I didn't find anything,” Rousseau said.

Police have said the girls and their father were believed to have been in a car crash on Highway 20 in St-Apollinaire on Wednesday evening.

Investigators said the car was heading east on the highway when it skidded into the median, flipped over and landed on the shoulder on the opposite side of the highway.

But police did not find any occupants inside the car when they arrived.

Lambert and Dion had joined the search on Saturday, criss-crossing the wooded area by car before the sisters' bodies were found, with autopsies to determine the cause of death still pending.

Those roads were closed Sunday as provincial police asked local residents to steer clear of the search area, saying their presence in the area on Saturday evening while acting on a tip was hindering officers.

“We know their intentions are very good, but what happened yesterday just complicated the work of the police officers,” Mathieu said.

Jocelyne Fortier lives in the neighbouring village of St-Agapit, where police have also looked.

“It's appalling, it's stressful,” she said. “We lock our doors, we don't know if it's dangerous or not.”

The car accident that triggered the investigation happened near her brother's residence. And the sisters remind her or her own nieces, about the same age.

“As soon as there are children involved, it's even more difficult,” Fortier said.

Carpentier was last seen wearing a grey T-shirt and jeans. He is listed as being five-foot-10 and weighing 130 pounds.

Anyone who sees Carpentier or has any information on his whereabouts to immediately contact 911.

Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre laid out the demand Sunday amid growing pressure on Trudeau and Liberal cabinet ministers to explain the genesis of the sole-sourced deal with WE, which was announced late last month before being cancelled days later.

""He needs to explain where exactly the idea came from,"" Poilievre said during a news conference on Parliament Hill in which he acknowledged the rarity of prime ministers appearing before parliamentary committees.

""Did the WE organization call him and suggest it? Did it come through the staff in his office? Did it come out of his own head? Did members of his family who had been paid by the organization suggest it to him. We need to hear directly from him on these questions.""

Trudeau announced the Canadian Student Services Grant on June 25, saying tens of thousands of students having a hard time finding summer work due to COVID-19 could volunteer up to 500 hours to earn the maximum $5,000 toward their post-secondary costs.

But the program came under immediate scrutiny after it was discovered that WE had been chosen to administer it. Trudeau said federal public servants had recommended the organization and that it was considered the only one capable of delivering the program.

Trudeau nonetheless faced accusations of cronyism and allegations of a conflict of interest over his past connections with WE. Those allegations have only grown after revelations his wife, brother and mother have been paid a combined $300,000 for appearing at a number of WE events.

The prime minister and Finance Minister Bill Morneau have both confirmed they did not recuse themselves from the cabinet vote that approved giving the contract to WE. One of Morneau's daughters has spoken at WE events while another does contract work for the organization.

Morneau's office has denied any link between his daughters' work and the WE agreement. The Conservatives and NDP have nonetheless asked Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion, who is already investigating Trudeau over the deal, to also look into a potential conflict of interest by Morneau.

The government and WE terminated the deal on July 3, which had promised the organization up to $19 million in payment depending on how many students participated. The federal employment and social development department has since taken over the program.

Poilievre said it is essential the prime minister appear before the finance committee personally to answer questions about the deal given that the controversy involves him personally and the House of Commons has been largely suspended due to COVID-19.

""Now there are two ways that this can be done,"" Poilievre said. ""Either the prime minister can agree voluntarily to show up and attend and respect the invitation of a parliamentary committee. That is what he will do if he has nothing to hide.

""Or Parliament can compel him to appear. Something that would take longer, but could be done -- and should be done -- if the prime minister hides from accountability.""

Such a move would need support from the Bloc Quebecois and NDP to even have a chance. Poilievre had yet to present his plan to the other parties on Sunday, but said: ""If the opposition parties are interested in getting to the truth, they will vote in favour of that motion.""

The Bloc Quebecois did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday while NDP finance critic Peter Julian was noncommittal.

""New Democrats believe in getting to the bottom of this and the more answers we get (including from Trudeau and Morneau) the quicker we can get those answers for the Canadian public,"" he said in a statement. ""Canadians want answers and they need to know this won't happen again.""

Even if the opposition parties agree to order Trudeau to appear before the committee using their superior numbers in the House of Commons, there is no guarantee it would happen, said University of Ottawa parliamentary expert Philippe Lagasse.

While the House of Commons can compel a member of Parliament to appear before a committee, Lagasse says that MP -- in this case the prime minister -- would likely ask the Speaker to rule on whether the request is appropriate or not.

""The House can say: 'In this case, we really need to hear from this person and therefore we're going to force them to appear,""' Lagasse said. ""But that would require a ruling from the Speaker in all likelihood because there would be some differences of interpretation.""

None of which addresses when Parliament would have a chance to address the issue, Lagasse said, given that the House of Commons is only scheduled to sit a total of three days between now and Sept. 21.

Authorities were called to a North York apartment building, in the Weston Road and Finch Avenue area, just after 10 a.m. on Saturday morning.

Police said when they arrived they located two children, a six-month-old girl and a four-year-old boy, suffering from stab wounds inside an apartment unit.

A video sent to CTV News Toronto by a viewer shows a woman being led into the back of a police cruiser in handcuffs. It also shows what appears to be the children being carried into an ambulance.

The children were rushed to SickKids Hospital with serious injuries, police said. Their injuries were initially deemed life-threatening but police later said their condition improved and are expected to survive.

Const. Alex Li said the 36-year-old mother, who was arrested at the scene, has been charged with two counts of attempted murder, two counts of assault and two counts of aggravated assault.

The identity of the woman will not be released, police said, to protect the identity of the victims.

""This is a very serious stabbing and we're taking this very seriously,” Li said. “We have deployed our available resources to look into the matter... You can expect an active crime scene.""

""Having young children myself, I couldn't imagine that type of trauma and injury,"" Li said.

Dixon took the lead shortly after a caution flag and beat Will Power by 2.5386 seconds. They were followed in order by Alex Palou, Ryan Hunter-Reay and Colton Herta.

Dixon has won each of the three IndyCar races in the pandemic-delayed season. He's the first IndyCar driver to start a season with at least three consecutive victories since Sebastien Bourdais reeled off four straight to start the 2006 campaign.

The only other drivers to open an IndyCar season with at least three straight victories are A.J. Foyt (seven in 1964) and Al Unser (three in 1971).

This marked the first time spectators were allowed in an IndyCar event this season after they weren't permitted in races at Fort Worth or Indianapolis. IndyCar is treating each event separately and following local and state health regulations at each track as it decides whether to allow fans.

""It's so cool to be back on a track with fans,"" Dixon said. ""And there's tons of them here today.""'

Dalton Kellett of Stouffville, Ont., was 20th.

Saturday's race took drivers 55 laps around a course that's just over 4 miles long with 14 turns.

Dixon qualified ninth Saturday for his worst starting position of the young season, as he'd started second in Fort Worth and seventh in Indianapolis. He wasn't a factor early in this one as Josef Newgarden was in command for the first half of the race.

Newgarden had grabbed the pole position earlier in the day and seemed on his way to winning at Road America for the second time in three years until he stalled coming out of his second pit stop and fell back in the pack. He ended up 14th.

Power owned a narrow lead over Dixon when Jack Harvey went off the track to produce a caution flag with 17 laps remaining. Dixon pulled ahead of Power coming out of the pits on the restart and stayed ahead after two more caution flags.

The second caution flag came when Conor Daly slid off the course after making contact with Pato O'Ward, knocking Daly out of the race and wrecking his Chevy. The final one came when Dalton Kellett went off course.

Dixon's latest victory was the 49th of his career, putting the New Zealander him behind only Foyt (67) and Mario Andretti (52).

Road America's setup made it an ideal venue for IndyCar to start allowing fans. The sprawling, 640-acre layout surrounding the course allows fans to practice social distancing and roam the property rather than crowding into a grandstand.

""Since we've been here before, we know there's plenty of room,"" said Jason Shelley of Indianapolis, who said he usually attends four or five IndyCar races each year. ""It's kind of like watching a race in a state park, so this is the one place where I feel comfortable and safe because I know I can get away from people. I'm not going to be stacked on top of people. That's why we came.""

Steve Lemon, a fan from Kankakee, Illinois, who usually attends about three races a year, said that ""if it had been an oval, we wouldn't have gone.""

Fans received temperature checks at gates and received masks and hand sanitizer as they entered.

Wearing a mask was encouraged but not required, and a stroll through along the Road America property indicated the majority of spectators were spending at least part of the time unmasked.

""All the staff and drivers and everybody are wearing masks, but I don't think the fans are quite as good about it,"" said Jim Cossaart, a spectator from Bristol, Vermont. ""Human nature, I guess.""

IndyCar also plans to have spectators next weekend for a doubleheader in Iowa, where the oval track has grandstands. IndyCar is hoping fans will fill 50% of the speedway's capacity for the Indianapolis 500 on Aug. 23.",[],661,0.9418875839477745

In screenshots from a now deleted post, the driver made the unfounded claim that the coronavirus is “not dangerous to those with good immune systems” and that people don’t need a vaccine “that will make us even more sick.” He says he came to these conclusions after doing some ""research.""

“Today, I no longer disinfect my bus because it is a false pandemic in order to better control people,” he wrote.

There is no evidence to support the driver's claim that the COVID-19 pandemic is ""false."" More than 12 million people around the world have become infected with the novel coronavirus; some 548,000 have died.

The Societe de transport de Montreal (STM) said in an email to CTV News that all buses are cleaned daily by maintenance teams, but “of course, we also ask our employees to follow public health and hygiene guidelines.”

The STM took to Twitter to add that ""One bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch."" The agency says it employs 11,000 people, ""and the very vast majority of them are doing a tremendous job following strict measures and recommendations in place since the beginning of the pandemic, to protect clients, colleagues and themselves altogether.""

Though the STM wouldn’t reveal how it intends to move forward with this particular driver, it said “it is our best practice to meet with employees to remind them of the instructions in force.”

A photo posted to the driver’s Facebook page suggests he’s also against the wearing of masks – which is set to become mandatory on all public transit in Quebec as of July 13. When Premier Francois Legault made the announcement last week, he said it would be up to bus drivers to refuse entry to passengers who aren’t wearing masks. No other enforcement measures will be in place.

The driver admitted that at the beginning of the pandemic, he showed up to his shifts 30 minutes early to disinfect his bus.

“I made a barrier to stop passengers from speaking to me… and I washed my hands a minimum of 20 times per day,” his post said. ""But with time, I found that something was wrong.""",[],376,0.9468280200706664

Instead of closing the gap to front-runner Mercedes this season, Ferrari's SF1000 car looks slower than last year and is also in danger of slipping behind other teams.

""The SF1000 didn't measure up, even compared to expectations,"" was Ferrari's blunt assessment.

Ferrari failed in qualifying at the season-opening Austrian Grand Prix, with Charles Leclerc only seventh -- having taken the most pole positions in 2019 -- and Sebastian Vettel a dismal 11th.

Leclerc's second-place finish in that race was more about his composure amid crashes than the car's speed. Vettel, who finished 10th, was so irked about lack of balance he called the car undriveable.

It means that Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto is facing increasing pressure, given that the team was already way behind Mercedes in the drivers' and constructors' titles in 2019.

His decision making also faced scrutiny after a sudden change of strategy, three days before the first practice session in Austria.

He announced a different direction in terms of aerodynamic development, which effectively meant there could not be any car upgrades until the third race in Hungary next week.

But then hierarchy intervened.

Ferrari CEO Louis Camilleri felt it was necessary to stop slipping back further and some of the aerodynamic package -- scheduled for Hungary --will be introduced in Austria.

""This is certainly not the grid position that a team like Ferrari should have and we have to respond immediately,"" Camilleri said. ""It's clear that we have to improve on all fronts.""

This weekend's race is the second of eight races during a hectic 10-week European swing.

The GP itself is changing names yet is still being held at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg -- surrounded by the Styrian mountains it is now being named after.

Different name, same objective for Red Bull driver Alexander Albon.

While Lando Norris secured his first career podium last weekend -- the youngest British driver ever to do so in F1 at the age of 20 -- Albon narrowly missed out on a first podium for the second time in three races.

Both times Hamilton was directly involved.

With a few laps left last Sunday it was Albon was on better tires than Hamilton and his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas, who won the race.

Albon made a hasty but clean move on the outside Hamilton, who appeared to slightly nudge his car left against Albon's passing wheel. Albon span off track while Hamilton was given a five-second time penalty, moving him from second to fourth.

Last November in Brazil, in the penultimate race of 2019, they chased second place on the second-last lap. Hamilton tried to pass Albon on the inside and clipped his car, sending Albon spinning down to 14th.

Albon was frustrated after Sunday's race, which proved doubly disheartening for Red Bull as Max Verstappen retired early when in second place.

But team principal Christian Horner sees cause for optimism.

""I believe the potential is there to fight Mercedes. Perhaps not over a single lap but over the course of the season,"" he said. ""Our race pace looked pretty decent with Max and Alex, so I think we've got the basis of a good car.""

It remains uncertain whether drivers will again take the knee in support of racial equality on Sunday. Hamilton wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt last time, when 14 of the 20 drivers took the knee.

""I want people to feel excited to be a part of the change,"" Hamilton said. ""To me it was an emotional and poignant chapter in the progress of making F1 a more diverse and inclusive sport.""",[],607,0.9366726882288641

In a ruling Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Paul Borman wrote that GM's alleged injuries were not caused by FCA violating federal racketeering laws. He wrote that GM has not stated a claim that can be granted, so the case must be dismissed.

GM said it disagreed with the ruling and will pursue legal remedies.

The ruling came after a federal appeals court on Monday overturned Borman's order that the CEOs of both companies meet in person to talk about settling the case. But the court denied GM's request to assign the case to another judge.

In the lawsuit, GM alleged that Fiat Chrysler bribed officials of the United Auto Workers union to get lower labour costs, giving FCA an advantage over its Detroit-area rival. GM alleged that FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne wanted to pressure GM into merging by weakening GM with higher labour costs.

In his ruling, Borman wrote that GM's “pay to harm” theory initially had appeal “but fails on a closer look.”

GM alleged that FCA used bribes to get the UAW to deny GM concessions that were given to Fiat Chrysler. But Borman wrote that the UAW wouldn't give the concessions to any company that didn't pay bribes. Therefore, GM's labour costs weren't any higher than they would have been without the bribes.

“In other words, FCA's UAW workers were the direct victims of the bribes because they were paid less, and GM suffered only an indirect competitive harm,” Borman wrote.

GM failed to show facts backing up the claim that it was harmed by Fiat Chrysler's actions under federal racketeering laws, Borman ruled.

FCA denies that it directed any prohibited payments. Its former labour chief, Al Iacobelli, is in prison after pleading guilty in 2018 to conspiracy and tax crimes in a scheme worth more than $1.5 million. He admitted that he turned the budget of a company-sponsored training centre into a slush fund.

Earlier, Borman described GM's lawsuit as a “nuclear option” that would be a “waste of time and resources” for years if he allowed the case to move forward. That prompted GM to ask an appeals court to change judges.

Federal agents have been rooting out corruption in the senior ranks of the UAW. The first wave of convictions in 2017 involved key FCA employees who used money from a jointly run training centre to reward union officials.",[],412,0.9889522264719472

Chairman Carlos Ghosn wired more than $860,000 to a company linked to one of the men accused of helping smuggle him out of Japan in a box last year, prosecutors said in a new court filing.

Prosecutors filed documents Tuesday detailing two wire transfers made by Ghosn in October 2019 as evidence they say shows Michael Taylor and Peter Taylor “have the resources with which to flee and therefore should continue to remain detained as flight risks.”

The documents show two wire transfers to the company Promote Fox LLC, which prosecutors say is managed by Peter Taylor.

Michael Taylor, a 59-year-old U.S. Army Special Forces veteran, and his 27-year-old son Peter Taylor are wanted in Japan on allegations that they helped Ghosn flee the country in December while he was out on bail and awaiting trial on financial misconduct allegations.

The Taylors are urging a judge to order their immediate release from jail while they challenge Japan's extradition request, arguing among other things that their health is in danger behind bars because of the coronavirus pandemic. Their lawyers say the men don't pose a risk of flight or danger to the community.

The defence says the Taylors were unlawfully arrested and argue they can't be extradited because “bail jumping” is not a crime in Japan and, therefore, helping someone evade their bail conditions isn't a crime either.

“Even assuming the Taylors were properly arrested, holding them without bail on a tenuous charge in a jail that has been plagued by COVID-19 violates their Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights. This is especially the case because neither is a risk of flight and there are undoubtedly conditions under which they can be released,” their attorneys told a judge in a filing this week.

Authorities say the Taylors helped sneak Ghosn out of the Japan on a private jet with former Nissan boss tucked away in a large box. The flight went first to Turkey, then to Lebanon, where Ghosn has citizenship but which has no extradition treaty with Japan.

Ghosn said he fled because he could not expect a fair trial, was subjected to unfair conditions in detention and was barred from meeting his wife under his bail conditions. Ghosn has said he is innocent of allegations he under-reported his future income and committed a breach of trust by diverting Nissan money for his personal gain.",[],390,0.9838762965381731

Trump suggested Bubba Wallace should apologize after the sport rallied around him after the noose was found in his assigned stall at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Federal authorities ruled last month the noose had been hanging since October and was not a hate crime. NASCAR and the FBI have exclusively referred to the rope -- which was used to pull the garage door closed -- as a noose.

It was the only garage pull out of 1,684 stalls at 29 inspected NASCAR tracks to be fashioned as a noose.

NASCAR President Steve Phelps has bristled at suggestions the noose was a hoax. Wallace was shown a photograph of the noose, never personally saw it, and was told by NASCAR officials he was the victim of a hate crime.

""Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX?"" Trump tweeted. ""That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!""

The tweet came after Trump used a pair of Independence Day speeches to dig deeper into America's divisions by accusing protesters who have pushed for racial justice of engaging in a ""merciless campaign to wipe out our history."" The remarks served as a direct appeal to the Republican president's political base, including many disaffected white voters, with less than four months to go before Election Day.

Wallace responded on Twitter with a note to ""the next generation and little ones following my foot steps"" in which he urged people to use their platform and not be detracted by ""hate being thrown at you.""

""Love should come naturally as people are TAUGHT to hate,"" Wallace tweeted. ""Even when it's HATE from the POTUS .. Love wins.""

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the president's decision to wade into the Wallace case, likening it to actor Jussie Smollett's claims he was a victim of a hate crime. McEnany criticized the press in a White House briefing, calling Trump's tweet a ""complete indictment of the media's rush to judgement.""

McEnany declined to explain why the president thought Wallace should have to apologize given he didn't report the noose. McEnany refused to say whether or not the president supports NASCAR's ban on the Confederate flag.

NASCAR did not directly address the Trump tweet in a Monday statement.

""We are proud to have Bubba Wallace in the NASCAR family and we commend his courage and leadership,"" NASCAR said. ""NASCAR continues to stand tall with Bubba, our competitors and everyone who makes our sport welcoming and inclusive for all racing fans.""

Andrew Murstein, co-owner of the Richard Petty Motorsports team that fields Wallace's car, called Trump's tweet ""a late, misinformed, and factually incorrect statement."" He also said it was unwarranted and cited the photo NASCAR released of the noose.

""A picture is worth a thousand words,"" Murstein said in a statement. ""Bubba has reacted in a truthful, professional, level headed manner. The NASCAR community and those in the know all stand by him.""

Wallace led the push for NASCAR to ban Confederate symbols at tracks. Two weeks later, the noose was found at the first race some fans were allowed to attend since the shutdown. On the same day, a plane pulling a banner of the Confederate flag that read ""Defund NASCAR"" was circling the track and protesters outside the speedway displayed their flags.

Two NASCAR drivers came to Wallace's defence Monday. Seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson, currently sidelined with the coronavirus, posted an image of Wallace's No. 43 that had been used by drivers in an earlier .IStandWithBubba campaign. Rookie Tyler Reddick tweeted but later deleted a reply to Trump that read: ""We don't need an apology. We did what was right and we will do just fine without your support.""

LeBron James and Chelsea Clinton were among those outside of NASCAR who backed Wallace on social media, with James stating he stands with Wallace.

NASCAR's complex relationship with Trump dates to early in his campaign when former chairman Brian France brought a contingent of drivers to a rally in Georgia.

France later sent a memo to NASCAR employees stating his political beliefs were his own and he was not speaking on behalf of the organization. France was replaced as chairman following his arrest for driving while impaired in 2018.

Other members of the France family welcomed Trump to Daytona for the season-opening race in February. Many drivers and owners mingled with Trump and posted selfies with the president.

Wallace, who was born in Alabama, has taken an active role in the push for racial equality. He has worn a shirt saying ""I Can't Breathe,"" and raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in Virginia.

Ramsey Poston, a former NASCAR consultant and now head of crisis management firm Tuckahoe Stategies, said Trump's tweet is harmful to NASCAR's push for inclusion. Wallace is one of just a handful of non-white drivers. Daniel Suarez is Mexican and Aric Almirola is of Cuban descent. Kyle Larson, who is half-Asian, was fired in April for using a racial slur.

""The brewing cultural war within NASCAR for equality has just erupted and the sport's efforts to separate from its past just got tougher,"" Poston said. ""The president's comments are essentially a rallying call for people who support the Confederate flag to challenge the sport's recent flag ban and create chaos.""

While Trump claimed NASCAR's ratings are down, they are actually up. Michael Mulvihill, executive vice-president at Fox Sports, tweeted that Fox viewership is up 8% since the sport returned from the pandemic hiatus on May 17. NBC took over the broadcast rights this past weekend and said its ratings for Sunday's race were up 46% from last year's event at Indianapolis.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC, pushed back against Trump's NASCAR tweet on Fox News Radio, saying NASCAR is trying to grow the sport by removing divisive symbols.

""I don't think Bubba Wallace has anything to apologize for,"" Graham said.

In a statement to CTV News, Morneau’s office said that there is “absolutely no link” between his daughters’ involvements with the charity and “any work that WE does with the Government of Canada.”

The statement confirmed what website Canadaland first reported: that the finance minister’s daughter Clare has spoken at WE events, and his daughter Grace is currently employed by WE Charity.

“Clare has spoken at WE events, as well as many other public events, in the context of the release of her book on young refugee girls. She has never been compensated for that work,” said Maeva Proteau, press secretary for Morneau.

As well, Morneau’s daughter Grace is a “contractual employee of WE in an administrative role in the travel department,” a job she has had since 2019 following her internship, according to Morneau’s office.

“She got this position on her own merits. There is absolutely no link between her employment and any work that WE does with the Government of Canada,” Proteau said.

Proteau confirmed that Morneau did not recuse himself from the discussions about the decision to offload the program meant to administer grants to students and new graduates for their volunteer work this summer.

NDP WANT INVESTIGATION

In light of Morneau’s statement, the New Democrats are calling for Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion to investigate Morneau. In a letter to the commissioner obtained by CTV News, NDP MP and ethics critic Charlie Angus says he thinks the finance minister’s decision to not recuse himself from conversations about outsourcing the program to We Charity merits more scrutiny.

“The Act has clear stipulations that prevent public office holders from making or participating in a decision related to the exercise of an official power, duty or function if the public office holder knows or reasonably should know that, in the making of the decision, he or she would be in a conflict of interest,” writes Angus.

“It would seem apparent that Minister Morneau would recognize that the fact that his family member was an employee of this organization necessitated him to recuse himself regarding this extraordinary decision to outsource nearly billion-dollar commitment of public funds in a single source contract,” Angus writes.

With the program halted, thousands of students are now in limbo without summer jobs and, for now, no chance for volunteer grants to help cover costs like fall tuition. The grant to post-secondary students and recent graduates was set to provide payments that amount to less than minimum wage for volunteering in pandemic-related programs, depending on the number of hours worked. For every 100 hours spent, a student would receive $1,000.

“The recommendation to have WE administer the program came from the public service,” Morneau’s office said.

APPEARED 'TOO CLOSE': LIBERAL MP

With Dion already looking into Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ties to WE Charity and his decision to not recuse himself from the contract discussions, the Conservatives are now calling for an RCMP probe, and for a full accounting of what all cabinet ministers knew about the extent of the Trudeau family’s connections to the charities. Trudeau’s wife, mother and brother were paid a range of amounts to speak at WE events over the years.

In an interview on CTV News Channel, Liberal MP Nate Erskine-Smith said that while he can’t speak for the state of mind either Trudeau or Morneau were in, he was “skeptical” about how the project was announced.

“I was glad to see the government reverse course in response to feedback… The prime minister and the finance minister appeared to me to be too close to this as far as decision-making goes, but ultimately this is in the hands of the ethics commissioner,” he said.",[],645,0.7207360597313801

The deficit projection released Wednesday is up dramatically from the latest pre-pandemic economic update in December 2019, which pegged the deficit at $28.1 billion in 2020-21.

In addition to direct government spending, the new figures in the government’s fiscal snapshot show the negative impact the global pandemic has had on the economy.

Citing the “extraordinary borrowing” the federal government is currently engaged in, the government says the federal debt will exceed $1.2 trillion by the end of the fiscal year, up from $765 billion in the previous fiscal year.

With unemployment rates set to remain high into next year, the government is also projecting a $71.1-billion decline in tax revenue, including a $40.8-billion loss in income taxes.

“This spending level is on par with, but lower than the peak deficit (as a per cent of GDP) experienced by Canada during the Second World War. This is truly the challenge of our lifetime. As temporary investment measures come to an end and GDP recovers over time, deficits are expected to retreat,” reads the snapshot, in part.

In total, the federal government has spent more than $231 billion in health and safety measures as well as on direct aid to Canadians and businesses over the course of the pandemic so far.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau unveiled the revised economic picture inside the House of Commons, which is gathered for a special sitting. He spoke about how this current fiscal situation is an opportunity for Canada to rebuild and reshape the economy.

“We need to invest in an economy that is greener and more diverse,” Morneau said. “This pandemic has identified clear gaps and it’s giving us a chance to reset. We witnessed the ways in which people were falling through the cracks… In the coming months, we will need to come to these problems with dedication, compassion, and ingenuity.”

During a press conference with reporters during a largely virtual “lockup,” ahead of tabling the 168-page snapshot, Morneau called the pandemic “an enormous shock to our system.”

“We faced an enormous shock to our system,” Morneau told reporters. “It’s hard to know where we will be in a month, two months, or six months. What we know for sure, is that if Canadians work together, we can continue on what we've seen as a month-by-month improvement of our situation, and our economic outcomes will be related to our success working together on our on our health challenges.”

He also suggested a silver lining in regards to Canada’s increased debt-to-GDP ratio. With current public debt charges at around one per cent of GDP, the cost to service the now ballooning debt is actually $4 billion lower this year than expected, given the historically low borrowing rates.

Due to the COVID-19 spending, the federal government now projects its debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to 49.1 per cent in 2020-21. In the pre-pandemic December economic update, Canada’s debt-to-GDP ratio was at 30.9 per cent and was projected to remain on track to reduce incrementally over the next few years.

“Even after our historic investments, Canada will continue to hold its low-debt advantage. This, combined with historically low interest rates, gave us the balance sheet to deploy our fiscal firepower to support Canadians through this,” Morneau said, though noted that his and likely future governments will have to face up to the deficit.

SHARPEST DROP SINCE GREAT DEPRESSION

The government is emphasizing the “challenge of a generation” that the COVID-19 pandemic is posing, and noted the serious and ongoing impacts. Over the last few months, federal job numbers have already showed 5.5 million Canadians are either out of work, or have lost wages; and a growing list of businesses are set to shutter their doors permanently.

Citing economists, in the snapshot the government says the overall economy is expected to contract by 6.8 per cent in 2020, which is its sharpest drop since the Great Depression, before rebounding by 5.5 per cent in 2021.

Based on forecasts by more than a dozen private sector economists, the government is projecting an unemployment rate of 9.8 per cent in 2020 and 7.8 per cent in 2021.

All of this is contingent on how the ongoing health crisis is managed, the government notes throughout the snapshot, emphasizing the economy’s health is largely in the hands of Canadians’ efforts to stave off a second wave of the novel coronavirus.

The snapshot also includes several scenarios for future economic outlooks, depending on what happens with the pandemic, from a gradual but uneven recovery to a virus resurgence scenario which would result in a “deeper and longer-lasting negative impact on the economy.”

While the government optimistically believes the worst of the economic impact is behind us, it will be a long time before a rebound, even under the most positive pandemic scenario that would see a vaccine discovered within the year.

Speaking to reporters in advance of the revised economic picture being made public, Trudeau said that the situation would have been much worse had the federal government not brought in massive aid measures.

“When the pandemic first hit, a lot of people lost their jobs overnight. They didn't know how they were going to feed their families, or pay their bills. Faced with this unprecedented challenge our government had two options: We could sit back and let Canadians fend for themselves... or we could swiftly and substantially choose to support Canadians. We chose to support Canadians,” Trudeau said.

MORE THAN $230 BILLION SPENT

The report — which is not a federal budget or a fiscal update — shows that, since March, the federal government has spent more than $231 billion on health and safety measures as well as direct aid to Canadians and businesses.

Though, the government cautioned in the document that the cost estimates for many of the aid programs have been “difficult to establish, given that they are brand new programs, launched in a highly volatile economic environment,” and said further updates will come as the data comes in.

Of that figure, $19.8 billion is considered spending for health and safety measures, and includes the $14 billion earmarked to go to the provinces and territories for their “safe restart” plans. The direct support totals $212.2 billion and includes the suite of emergency response aid programs, as well as the support for local community organizations on the front lines of delivering key services to Canadians.

It also details the cost of a range of non-COVID-19 policy actions taken by the federal government since the 2019 economic update, which in total for the 2020-21 fiscal year amounts to just over $9 billion.

The government says the pandemic aid spending — on everything from support for seniors and farmers, to stocking up on personal protective equipment and vaccine development — is “the most comprehensive and substantial peacetime investment in Canada’s history.”

The biggest-ticket items to date, which the government said could still evolve over time, include:

The $2,000-a-month Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which nearly 8.2 million Canadians have applied for, totalling $53.5 in aid payments but an overall estimated budget of $80 billion;

The 75-per-cent emergency wage subsidy, which has seen 252,370 unique applicants and $18.1 billion spent. Though, the program is expected to be reworked in some way soon, as the CERB nears end of its course, and as a result the government is projecting in the end it will end up costing $82.3 billion to pay employers to keep staff on;

The Canada Emergency Student Benefit, which provides $1,250 a month to most eligible students, more to those with dependents. To date $1.4 billion has been paid out to more than 600,000 applicants; and

The Canada Emergency Business Account, which offers businesses loans of up to $40,000. According to the new figures, 688,000 applicants have received these loans, totaling $27.4 billion.

As well, in an effort to buoy businesses big and small, in addition to the direct spending offered, the federal government has made available $600 billion in liquidity and government-guaranteed loans which Morneau has said he hopes will bridge key job creators in this country to better times. This included $85 billion in tax and customs duty payment deferrals, to help companies free up some of their funding for other expenses.

In his Commons remarks, he notes that nearly nine out of every 10 dollars in COVID-19 aid delivered to Canadians and businesses is financed by the federal government.

The snapshot also looks at how Canada’s economic response compares to that of other countries, and outlines the plummet that consumer confidence and mobility trends have taken over the last four months.

PBO 'SCARED AND DISAPPOINTED'

In an interview on CTV News Channel reacting to the news, Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux said he was “scared and disappointed,” after seeing the snapshot.

The deficit is almost $100 billion larger than his office estimated the deficit was on track to hit $256 billion this fiscal year.

“We still don't have any sense of what is the government's game plan to get the Canadian economy back on track again,” Giroux said. “It's a much bigger deficit than even I expected, and that's why it's really scary to see these big numbers.”

He is calling on the federal government to look at ways to rework the Employment Insurance program to help those who have maxed out their benefits but remain out of work due to no fault of their own, as several industries are set to take months longer than others to rebound.

The snapshot includes information from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business that shows that while the construction, agriculture, manufacturing and personal services sectors are closer to being considered fully open, large portions of the hospitality, arts and recreation, social services, retail, and real estate sectors will take a lot longer before the majority of businesses are fully open for business.

Today’s snapshot comes after opposition parties and economists called for a look at the federal books, and after resisting a more robust update, the government now says it is planning to release a larger fiscal outlook in the fall.

The overall economic numbers are the first offered by the federal government since the December 2019 update, which was the only one since the Liberal formed a minority government in the last election.

They are limited to the current picture within this fiscal year, ending March 31, 2021, given further predictions could be inaccurate given the ongoing volatility, according to the government.

The 2020 federal budget date was scheduled to be March 30, but that was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic surging at the time.

OPPOSITION REACT TO 'DIRE' PICTURE

Reacting to the figures in the House of Commons, outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer called the snapshot “an extremely dire picture,” and criticized the government for lacking a plan to get Canada’s economy back on stable footing.

“Coming out of the pandemic, every single country on the planet will be desperately competing for the same opportunities and the same investments, so where is the prime minister’s plan to set us apart?” Scheer said.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is now calling on the federal government to look to offshore tax havens to drum up revenue to try to offset the ballooning debt and deficit, as well as imposing a “wealth tax” to raise revenue.

“Let’s ask the wealthiest to bear the brunt of the pandemic, not the families and the working people who are struggling to get by,” Singh said.

Green Party Parliamentary Leader Elizabeth May called on the government to move on the promised aid for people with disabilities that has been caught up in procedural limbo and has yet to be implemented, despite being promised several weeks ago.

It’s likely to now be a years-long endeavour to navigate Canada out of the red. While the fiscal snapshot includes a chapter on the government’s debt-management strategy, given the limited time frame the document covers, there is no plan to return to balance included.",[],1988,0.841639354446243

The conclusion of the special sitting marks the end of more routine gatherings of MPs, with the next time the House convenes set for early July.

Through a series of oral approvals, MPs signed off on approximately $87 billion in funds to tie over federal departments and, in this case, COVID-19 aid programs until the fall. The agreement to pass the funding was given “on division,” meaning no recorded vote was required.

The two spending bills were the first chance since the pandemic shut down the regular sittings for MPs to indicate whether or not they still have confidence in the Liberal minority, though the sitting came and went without that opportunity being taken.

The Liberals’ commitment to an extension of a key COVID-19 aid program, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, was what secured them the support needed to pass the supplementary estimates -- otherwise known as supply or the next cycle of scheduled and new federal spending.

Because of the Liberals’ minority standing, they needed to have the backing of at least one of the other parties in order to pass the spending measures, and the stakes were considerably higher in this instance because any votes that have to do with money, such as the federal budget or the estimates, are traditionally considered confidence votes.

In any parliament, a government lives so long as it maintains the confidence of the House of Commons. This confidence is demonstrated each time a key vote passes.

Approving the funding comes after both the Bloc Quebecois and NDP signalled they were not interested in seeing MPs line up to cast ballots amid a pandemic -- which could have happened if the Liberals lost Wednesday’s confidence votes and a snap election was called.

JUST 40 SITTING DAYS IN LAST YEAR

Wednesday’s sitting marked the 40th day there has been some form of an actual of House of Commons sitting in the last year, which did include the usual suspension over the summer of 2019 and then the fall federal election campaign.

Though after that October vote, the Liberals waited until December to reconvene the House.

CTVNews.ca asked Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez last week about the limited number of sitting days and, as a result, the limited number of government mandate items that have been able to progress. He said the time taken pre-pandemic to adjust to the minority reality was necessary and no one could have anticipated a global health crisis would hit.

“We suggested a very ambitious agenda, a very complete throne speech, with everything that comes with it, and then we had COVID,” Rodriguez said. “But even with COVID, we adapted.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said once again Wednesday that the agreement to sit under the current structure was reached with the backing of the NDP and Greens, and defended the Liberals’ approach to Parliament.

“Three different parties came together to make a determination of what Parliament would do,” Trudeau said.

“Every time something doesn't go their way an opposition party cries, ‘oh no’ and it's a dictatorship all of a sudden. It's sort of irresponsible and it undermines I think the strength of our democracy that we've been able to show through this crisis,” said the prime minister during his Rideau Cottage press conference.

SPECIAL COMMITTEE COMING TO AN END

Before the special sitting got underway, MPs held their second last meeting of the special all-party COVID-19 committee of MPs. The committee is the first real experiment with a hybrid parliamentary sitting in the House chamber, but that experiment is nearly over.

As has been the case in the 23 of these meetings so far, MPs offered up statements and riding-specific petitions, before going through a question period-style session where the Liberals were grilled on the shortcomings in their COVID-19 plans and on other key policy matters.

In the motion passed on May 16, which put in place the structure of the summer sittings, MPs voted to cease the special committee after Thursday’s meeting. Its end will also mark the end of some form of MPs meeting four days a week, with them not all together until the first of four special sitting days in July.

As of June 18, the special committee will cease to exist, leaving just the four gatherings— July 8, July 22, Aug. 12, and Aug. 26— before the prospect of a more ‘normal’ House of Commons could convene come Sept. 21.

And as Trudeau announced on Wednesday morning, the July 8 sitting will also be where Finance Minister Bill Morneau will present “an economic and fiscal snapshot.”

STUDYING REMOTE VOTING, RULE CHANGES

One of the major limitations that has yet to be worked out is how to allow MPs to vote remotely.

This question is one that the Procedure and House Affairs (PROC) committee has been diving deeper into and evaluating how a formal hybrid House of Commons session could occur, the rule changes required to allow that, and what it would take to implement a remote voting system. The committee has been given a June 23 deadline to report back to its colleagues.

The government—with the support of the NDP—has argued that Parliament has continued to function through the pandemic, noting that under the new structure, the government has faced more questions from the opposition than it would have under normal House sitting parameters.

However, the Conservatives, and to a certain degree the Bloc Quebecois, have characterized the special committee as essentially a knock-off of Parliament and called for a more robust resumption of sittings that would have allowed for more accountability on the massive government policies being rolled out, while respecting the health and safety of all on Parliament Hill.

So, it remains to be seen whether the recommendations out of PROC could result in a change of plans when it comes to the summer and fall sitting schedule.",[],982,0.9270943632896348

The app will compile confirmed positive COVID-19 cases and notify Canadians when they’ve been in proximity to someone who has the virus.

The government intends to make the free app available for download in early July and said that the program will be compatible with 30 million smartphones in Canada, meaning a significant portion of the population could use the app and be notified directly if they’ve come into contact with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 14 days.

Trudeau described the app as one that people can download and forget about, though it is set to face scrutiny over the fine print of its privacy and permissions settings, as Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien says he’s yet to offer his recommendations about the app to the government.

In making the announcement the prime minister said the case monitoring and exposure notification application a “crucial” public health step as more Canadians begin resuming some semblance of normal life, including returning to work.

“I want to stress that this will be completely voluntary. It will be up to individual Canadians to decide whether to download the app or not. But the app will be most effective when as many people as possible have it,” Trudeau said.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Thursday afternoon that the app will be part of the province’s overall tracing strategy.

“If we can trace, we can track it,” Ford said, adding that his government will have more to say in the coming days about the “made-in-Ontario” app.

Health authorities in Ontario will be the first to distribute the unique codes to people who test positive for COVID-19.

Trudeau said there are other provinces, including British Columbia, that are working with the federal government on the app, but it will be available to anyone in Canada who wants to use it.

“It'll actually allow us to have a better sense of when there are spikes or resurgences of a virus in a particular area or not because more people will be getting that notification and calling their local public health authorities, so any level of uptake would be useful,” Trudeau said, adding that he hopes Canadians view the app as an easy added layer of protection.

HOW IT WILL WORK

The app was originally developed by the Government of Ontario and the prime minister said that the Canadian Digital Service —a federal body—will work with Shopify and Blackberry on the new software, which Apple and Google have teamed up to offer, using Bluetooth technology to register when devices may come into proximity with one another.

The technology will be owned and operated by the Government of Canada.

The plan with the app is to have a health-care professional help Canadians who test positive upload their status anonymously into the national network.

Then, other users who have the app will be alerted if they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive, encouraging them to reach out to their local public health agency.

The app will also provide users with information on the latest jurisdiction-specific public health information.

“There will be a database of randomized codes associated with each smartphone that has this app that will be divided into two columns: those who may have tested positive, and those who have not tested positive. So if your phone gets in proximity for a certain amount of time, at a certain closeness to another phone, it'll register that it has had contact with that anonymized number,” Trudeau said.

The app will be available for Ontarians to download on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the coming weeks.

ONE APP ACROSS CANADA?

As it was first billed, the federal government’s intent was to come out with a single contact tracing app that would be “recommended strongly” to be used across the country, but as Health Minister Patty Hajdu signalled earlier this month, that plan has faced pushback from some provinces that preferred to conduct contact-tracing “the old-fashioned way,” or who had already launched their own digital tracing methods.

The traditional contact tracing currently being done involves people making calls for various public health agencies to help track down anyone who may have come into contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases.

If all provinces don’t sign on or endorse the app, Canada could end up with a patchwork of applications being used across the country and, as a result, limited efficacy when it comes to interprovincial spread.

In an effort to lobby all Canadians to come on side, Trudeau said the app will be customized to each province that signs on.

“It will be one app that whether you download it and live in Ontario and travel to B.C. or travel to the Northwest Territories— if that becomes an option—it will work everywhere across the country. So, it's one app for all Canadians,” he said.

Asked about the role contact tracing can play, infectious disease specialist Dr. Abdu Sharkawy said something more than the old-fashioned approach is needed.

“We look at the contact tracing ability that we have now, and we're using a 1985 form of technology, with phone calls and fax machines, for a 2020 pandemic. We need something that is going to be a bit more sophisticated a bit more efficient,” he told CTV News Channel ahead of Trudeau’s announcement.

“You can do as many tests as you want, but if you don't have the ability to identify who is in contact with a positive case, you don't really have an opportunity to stem the tide and prevent an outbreak from occurring, and community transmission to become something that's much more severe,” Sharkawy said.

PRIVACY CONCERNS

Beyond the hurdles of getting public health agencies in every corner of the country to sign on, the federal government will have to address Canadians’ privacy and security hesitations in order to get the rate of downloads needed to make this effective.

There are also concerns that have been raised around the adequacy of current privacy laws to protect Canadians should a breach occur.

Trudeau said Thursday that “the privacy of Canadians will be fully respected,” and that the government has spoken to the privacy commissioner about the application.

However, in a statement to CTVNews.ca, Therrien’s office said they were “recently contacted by Health Canada” about the app.

“We have requested and are awaiting necessary information and, until such time as we receive that information, we have not provided our recommendations to the government. We are working diligently and responsibly to develop that advice,” said Therrien’s office.

The federal government is also establishing an external advisory council “to provide guidance during the roll-out of the app with a view to ensuring it operates in a transparent way and in the public interest.”

In May, Therrien issued a joint statement with provincial and territorial privacy commissioners, calling for governments to ensure that any applications being developed or recommended respect Canadian privacy laws.

Among the privacy watchdog’s recommendations: ensuring the app was voluntary; its scope and ability to monitor users’ behaviour must be science-based; the data collected is de-identified as much as possible; and that it is subject to independent oversight.

“At no time will personal information be collected or shared, and no location services will be used,” Trudeau said, calling the app “totally secure and completely anonymized.”

Tech analyst Carmy Levy said in an interview on CTV News Channel that while he’ll wait and see how the app functions when it’s downloadable, it is a positive step to see the app won’t use location services. But he said that even with “all reasonable efforts” being taken to strip away identifiable information, to a certain degree nothing is fully anonymous.

“We are opening up a bit of a privacy Pandora's box. Are we taking reasonable precautions? Yes… But kind of have to balance that and gauge, what are we getting back in return for this risk? Are we allowing ourselves to get ahead of the pandemic?”

Ryerson's Cybersecure Policy Exchange released a report on contact tracing earlier this month and it found that based on a survey of 2,000 Canadians in mid-May, a majority of those surveyed were supportive of making some form of anonymized app mandatory.

Thursday marks 100 days since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and it was on this day that Canada officially recorded more than 100,000 cases of COVID-19, as provinces continue to ramp up testing to understand accurate levels of infection in the country.",[],1402,0.9194934825675146

Transportation Services General Manager John Manconi says the concern is not the cracked wheels on the vehicles, but the fact the cracks have occurred so early in the system’s life.

The TSB announced on Friday that it is conducting a “Class 3” investigation after cracks were found on a total of four wheels on three separate vehicles during maintenance and inspection activities.

Speaking on CTV Morning Live Monday morning, Manconi said Rideau Transit Maintenance, Alstom and OC Transpo started investigating as soon as the cracks were discovered.

“The investigations started immediately and that’s with a team of experts both on the consortium side, the city side and now we have TSB also,” said Manconi.

“Which is good because that offers different lenses and checks upon checks, which is what you want with a safety element such as this.”

Alstom, the builder of the rail cars, is required to do regular inspections on all wheels until the source of the wheel cracks are discovered.

“The good news is that they have not found any additional cracked wheels and the inspection regime is working. Every single vehicle gets inspected after its been in use.”

Manconi told CTV Morning Live that there are several “checks and balances” on the rail system, including Transport Canada, an independent oversight body that reports to Council, and a Chief Safety Officer that reports to him.

“That Chief Safety Officer and myself we can ground the fleet, we can bring it to an immediate stop if we have any safety concerns or any concerns without asking anyone,” Manconi said.

“The first thing we asked when we heard of a potential cracked wheel, we asked for documentation from RTG from the safety experts that says there’s no risk to the public. The TSB has asked for the documentation and our independent experts and our Chief Safety Officer. We’ve seen that twice now in terms of the vehicles can continue to be in use if they’re inspected.”

Rick Chiarelli is arguing a report by the City of Ottawa's integrity commissioner was ""unfair"" because he was unable to participate in the process and he is accusing the commissioner and the City of failing to accommodate his health conditions.

On Friday, Integrity Commissioner Robert Marleau released a report recommending “the most severe of sanctions” against Coun. Chiarelli after investigating allegations of improper conduct toward women applying for jobs in his office.

The report recommended council suspend Chiarelli’s salary for three consecutive 90-day periods, which amounts to more than $79,000 in pay.

The allegations against Chiarelli, which were first reported by CBC Ottawa in September 2019, involved comments that left the complainants “uncomfortable, embarrassed and troubled,” the report said.

The report details three complaints from people who had interviewed for a job in Coun. Chiarelli’s office. Marleau received two other complaints from former employees of his office, which he said would be dealt with in a separate report.

Chiarelli has denied any wrongdoing. In his most detailed response to the allegations last October, he denied the allegations and claimed they were part of a coordinated political attack. He told CTV News in November he would be vindicated.

Statement claims commissioner failed to accommodate ailing councillor

The councillor's office issued a statement to the Ottawa Citizen on Friday, arguing the report was ""unfair"" because Chiarelli was unable to participate due to medical issues.

""The report is unfair because it was completed without consideration for Councillor Chiarelli having the opportunity to comment, not because he was unwilling to participate but because the Councillor was unable to due to ongoing medical issues which led to him requiring Open-Heart surgery then followed by severe complications which were documented,"" the statement to the Citizen said. ""Medical notes were provided to the Integrity Commissioner on several occasions which he failed to mention in his Interim Report despite having them at that time but those are now recorded in the final report.

""On April 14, the Councillor also experienced another medical emergency which was determined to be a TIA aka mini-stroke which led to some temporary memory loss and a recommendation from the neurosurgeon extending his medical leave and not to participate in anything stressful until the end of July.""

Marleau's report says, in item 31, that Chiarelli was ""afforded the opportunity to provide written responses, information, and documentation, to be interviewed on invitation and to represent his position in response to the allegations.""

Marleau said he had issued a summons for Chiarelli to appear and provide testimony under oath but he doubts that it was brought to Chiarelli's attention.

Marleau told council in May, he would continue his investigation without Chiarelli's participation.

On Sunday afternoon, CTV News Ottawa was provided with the same statement given to the Ottawa Citizen on Friday, but the councillor's office included three additional paragraphs accusing Marleau and the City of Ottawa of failing to accommodate Chiarelli's health.

""While the Integrity Commissioner does acknowledge at item 80 of his report that Councillor Chiarelli has experienced significant health challenges and acknowledges receiving medical certificates he has repeatedly failed to take into consideration how these serious health challenges have prevented him from being able to participate,"" the additional statement to CTV News says. ""Namely an open-heart operation and serious bacterial infection that lasted several months for which the Councillor has shared information about openly with the public as well as Mr. Marleau as well as other complications.

""Mr. Marleau has repeatedly ignored medical professionals opinions not on an expected return to work date at the end of March but an appointment for Medical re-assessment and further concluded that the Councillor was unwilling to participate in early May when he had been provided a medical certificate with an expected return to work date of late June this was later extended to the end of July.

""This clearly shows that the Integrity Commissioner and the City of Ottawa have failed in their duty to accommodate the Councillor in regards to his health condition as it relates to his participation in this investigation.""

Director of Strategic Affairs & Communications in Chiarelli's office, Chantal Lebel, sent the statement to CTV News on Chiarelli's behalf.

The final sentence of the statement says a judicial review was filed with the court on Friday, ""as this process was filled with bias, no natural justice and was based on no tangible evidence except hearsay.""

Chiarelli requested a leave of absence from council in October, citing a doctor’s note that he had fainted, but his colleagues denied the request. He had open-heart surgery in December and was subsequently treated for a bacterial infection, according to a tweet on his account in January, reportedly sent by his wife.

Since council denied his request for medical leave, Chiarelli has shown up to some council meetings in order to maintain his seat. Under Ontario law, a municipal council seat is declared vacant if a councillor does not attend meetings for three consecutive months.

Council will consider Marleau's report Wednesday and decide whether to penalize Chiarelli.

The proposed new bylaw gives Ottawa Bylaw officers the power to issue fines ranging from $200 to $400 to people caught not wearing face masks in indoor public places during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Council will vote Wednesday on a proposed mandatory face mask bylaw, that will remain in effect until at least August 26. Medical Officer of Health Dr. Vera Etches announced last Monday that face masks will be mandatory in all indoor public places starting Tuesday, July 7.

While the bylaw includes a fine for non-compliance of wearing a face mask in indoor places, Ottawa's general manager of emergency services says Ottawa Bylaw officers will focus on education and not enforcement.

""Our objective here, should Council approve the report, is to supplement what Dr. Etches has been telling us. This is an individual responsibility and we all have to as a community step up,"" said Anthony Di Monte.

""Yes, we're putting a bylaw in that's giving us new tools; our focus is definitely education and communication with people to try to attempt them to ensure that they wear a mask.""

Di Monte said the Bylaw Services officers would ""not"" be patrolling for people not wearing masks to issue fines, adding the bylaw is a ""tool within our toolkit"" for people who ""continuingly"" refuse to wear a face mask.

In a report for Council, city staff said the proposed bylaw for mandatory face masks will focus on indoor locations where the public has access as they re-open. Visitors must wear a face mask at: restaurants and other eating and drinking establishments; retail locations; places of worship; sports facilities; museums, theatres and other entertainment venues; public areas in hotels and other short-term rental premises; and public areas in hospitals and other health facilities. The mandatory face mask bylaw will also apply to City of Ottawa buildings and facilities, including libraries.

On June 15, face masks became mandatory on all OC Transpo buses, the O-Train, in stations and on Para Transpo Vehicles. The new City of Ottawa face mask policy would cover violations on OC Transpo property.

Staff say, ""As with any bylaw, or with any new public health measure, the primary objective is to educate and inform, and gain voluntary compliance.""

""However a bylaw does provide a means to impose penalties through tickets should such action be deemed necessary, such as in the case where a warning is insufficient or with repeat offenders.""

The proposed fine ranges between $200 and $400 for not wearing a face mask.

The report for Council says the ""requested fines will be a reasonable amount, in keeping with the set fines of most other City bylaws, in the range of $200-400, based on the individuals or Corporations, subject to the approval of the Ontario Court of Justice.""

""The bylaw will have a fine component to it, but frankly I hope we never have to use that,"" said Keith Egli, Chair of Ottawa's Board of Health.

""What we've seen in the last couple of days with our businesses and with the customers is heartening, and shows we're on the right track.""

If approved by Council, the bylaw will take effect immediately and remain in effect until the next regularly scheduled Council meeting on August 26. Staff says Council may extend the bylaw for an additional period of time.",[],574,0.8441948174968231

TikTok lets users record and post short video clips. It's proven incredibly popular, especially with teens and people in their early 20s.

However, security experts and some U.S. politicians have issued warnings about the app's origins and about what it does in the background when it is and is not being used, prompting some companies to tell their employees to remove it from their phones.

Carmi Levy, the director of content marketing at the London, Ont.-based Info-Tech Research Group tells Newstalk 580 CFRA's ""The Goods with Dahlia Kurtz"" that TikTok collects far more data than it needs and he's advising smartphone users to delete it.

""This app is bad news,"" Levy says. ""We're just not paying attention. Everyone is so focused on sharing cute little videos of their dogs dancing to fun music that they don't realize that, in the background, this app is probably one of the worst of the worst that we've ever seen in the era of smartphones.""

Levy says the popularity of TikTok with young people is part of the reason he's warning people about the risks.

""It is a relatively young demographic that doesn't see smartphone apps as a risk,"" he says.

Levy points to the permissions TikTok asks the user to approve before they can use it.

""The app is deliberately built to access everything on your phone. When you install it, it pops up a little message saying, 'Do you give us the right to access your contacts, your schedule, your camera, your mic, your location services?' Everything. Of course, you say 'yes' because you want to use it.""

Levy also warned that a Chinese company called ByteDance makes the app, which leaves them open to influence by China's communist government.

TikTok has said it stores user data on U.S.-based servers that aren't subject to Chinese law. It has also denied sharing user data with the Chinese government and has insisted it would not do so, if asked.

Nevertheless, Levy still warns that the data the app collects is far broarder than it needs to be.

""This app collects so much information on us,"" Levy says. ""It's not just within the app; it's everything else that we're doing. You post something on Facebook: TikTok knows. You tweet something: TikTok knows. You go to the store to buy something: TikTok knows.""

Earlier this week, Amazon told its staff to delete the app in a companywide email, before backtracking about five hours later, saying the directive was a mistake.

Below are some of Levy's tips for keeping your data safe.

'Is it reasonable?' Check your permissions

Levy says apps of all kinds ask for permission to use certain things, like your microphone, camera, or location. Just because an app wants to access those things does not make it dangerous, but he says to consider whether the request is reasonable.

""Ask yourself, when you're installing an app, what are the reasonable things this app should be asking for in order to do its job?"" He says. ""It makes sense for Google Maps to ask for access to location services. Similarly, if it's a scheduling or collaboration app, it should probably have access to our calendar and contacts. There should also be controls within the app to allow us to turn those accesses off if we wish but still use the app.

""The problem with TikTok is it asks for everything, even if the services aren't related to what the app is trying to do.""

Get rid of apps you're not using

Levy suggests reviewing your apps regularly, and being more cynical about downloading new ones.

""We need to start looking at what we download and what we use it for, and we need to be a lot more careful about what we say yes to and what we hold on to over time,"" Levy says.

Levy says apps that are not on your smartphone's front screen are used less often.

""If you're not using that, get rid of it,"" he says. ""If you're not using them regularly, they're still most likely collecting information in the background.""

Be choosy about new apps

""Look at each app not just as something cool that all your friends are using,"" Levy says. ""Only download the things you're going to use. Worry that these apps are, in fact, spyware. Assume an app is spyware until it proves otherwise. When you're on the app store, read the page. See where it comes from, see how many times it's been downloaded, look at what other people are saying about it, look online and read the reviews.""

He also warns that some apps will install more than one icon, and you may not know you're installing multiple apps if you just rush to download something.

Review your settings, app by app, regularly

""Go into your settings. It will actually tell you which apps are accessing which services. Go through them one at a time and ask yourself, 'am I really comfortable with that?' Turn off the accesses that are not comfortable for you,"" Levy says.

""Apps are always doing stuff in the background that we may or may not know about, so we've got to keep them honest and do regular maintenance.""

Levy suggests setting an alarm in your calendar once a month to remind yourself to review your apps.

""When it pops up, take an hour or half an hour, and just go through your devices for things that look funny because, chances are, if they look funny to you, they are problematic and you're going to want to shut them down now.""

Medical Officer of Health Dr. Vera Etches announced that Ottawa Public Health is mandating the use of masks in indoor public spaces to help limit the spread of COVID-19.

Ottawa Public Health has tips for washing, re-using, storing and discarding a cloth mask or face covering after using it on its website.

The health unit says masks or face coverings become contaminated, especially when touched by your hands.

Removing the mask:

Ottawa Public Health says, ""after washing your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, remove your mask by pulling the ties or ear loops away from your ears.""

Washing the mask:

If your mask has a removable, non-reusable filter, make sure to remove and throw out the filter before machine washing or hand-washing your mask.

When using a washing machine, Ottawa Public Health says put the cloth mask directly into the washing machine or in a bag that can be emptied into the washing machine. Throw out the bag after you have used it to store your mask.

Wash your hands again with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after handling your mask.

Wash the masks with other laundry using a hot water cycle.

For hand-washing the cloth face mask, Ottawa Public Health says use laundry detergent and water as hot as you can stand, then dry thoroughly.

If you are discarding damaged or worn out masks, drop them in a lined garbage bin.

Ottawa Public Health says do not leave any discarded masks in places where others can come in contact with them such as shopping carts, public seats, but stops or on the ground.

Reusing your face mask

Ottawa Public Health says cloth masks may be re-used throughout the day, ""if not soiled and undamaged.""

When removing your face mask, public health says ""with clean hands, remove the mask from your face and fold it in half so that the outer space is inwards (so that the contaminated outer surface is not contacting anything during storage) and place it in a clean, sealable bag until ready to use it again the same day.""

Can I wear my cloth mask all day?

Ottawa Public Health says a mask can be worn all day as long as it does not become damaged, damp or dirty.

""Do not share your mask with others,"" the health unit says.

""Remove your mask with clean hands when you are safely able to do so and wash your hands using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.""

Storing your face mask during the day

Ottawa Public Health reminds people ""do not place your used mask into your pocket.""

When reusing a mask, place it in a clean, sealable bag until ready to use it again the same day.""

He strongly believes it will work.

Speaking to the media for the first time since the NBA shut down on March 11 due to COVID-19, the Toronto Raptors veteran was feisty. He chastised one reporter for having bad WiFi. He pretended not to hear another. He said the best thing about the four month layoff was not having to ""talk to any of you guys.""

But the 34-year-old guard was serious when it came to the coronavirus, which is raging across the U.S. like a prairie grass fire. He's confident in the safety of the NBA's campus at Walt Disney World.

""Protocols are unbelievable, I think our protocols and our health and safety measures have been top-notch, I think this thing will work perfectly,"" Lowry said. ""I think the league, the players' association has done a phenomenal job of making sure that we're doing everything that we can possibly do to make sure that we're healthy, we're safe and we're in an environment where we can be successful and to do our jobs at a high level.""

In the time since the NBA chose to play at Disney World, Florida has become a COVID-19 hot spot, setting a record by topping 15,000 new cases on Sunday.

Major League Soccer also chose Disney World for its MLS is Back tournament, but stumbled out to a rocky start, with two teams withdrawing due to positive tests, and numerous game delays.

Lowry is a ""big fan of how everything has come together"" for the NBA, and said the weeks spent on a cruise ship with the U.S. basketball team at the 2016 Rio Olympics -- the team opted not to stay in the athletes village -- helped prepare him for the Florida campus and its restrictions.

""That experience was pretty awesome, being around those guys, but it kind of really prepared me for this type of living,"" said Lowry, wearing a backwards blue baseball cap on a Zoom call Monday. ""To live on a boat and be in a smaller room and not have as many amenities, that time really prepared me for this.""

He has no complaints about the living arrangements, which could be home to the Raptors for nearly three months.

""Listen, I'm living good,"" he said. ""I'm healthy, my family is good, I get to play basketball, I can't really complain. I get meals and I'm happy. I'm able to do my job and provide for my family and to get out there and entertain and try to give some enthusiasm back into the world with our basketball abilities.""

Raptors coach Nick Nurse said the fact Lowry was a big part of the team's restart plans trickles down to the rest of the team.

""Having him as the guy who's kind of setting the example, he'll say to these guys, 'Take this stuff seriously, take these protocols seriously, let's be smart and let's do it,"" and I think it certainly resonates with the rest of the team,"" the coach said.

""Let's be smart"" will be key to the restart's success. New broke Monday that Houston Rockets forward and former Raptor Bruno Caboclo inadvertently broke quarantine and must now self-isolate in his room for eight days.

Nurse praised Lowry both for his leadership in the restart and on the court.

""It's clearly Kyle's team. His care factor is way up there, his intelligence factor is way up, we're in good hands with him being the leader of this team,"" Nurse said. ""When a guy plays the way he does, the leadership by example -- that phrase is probably over-used, but it's certainly the case. For basketball in general, the way you play is like the first kind of characteristic of being a great leader.""

Lowry, who has two young sons Karter and Kameron, said it will ""suck"" to be away from them for the next few weeks -- families aren't permitted at Disney World until the second round of the playoffs.

But he said his boys understand the sacrifices required right now to play basketball.

""They understand that their dad has to go to work,"" Lowry said. ""The one thing I always say is FaceTiming technology, as you guys see on this Zoom thing, it's changed the game, so I can talk to my kids every single day. They can FaceTime me, they call me to talk, it's kind of interactive, we make sure that I know what's going on with their day, they're consistently asking me questions, and asking me to buy them Roblox (an online game).

""That's all they really care about is Roblox, and my money and spending it.""

The four-month break gave Lowry the rare chance to be home with his sons, and he cherished the time with them, and the opportunity to be able to tuck them into bed at night.

""That was the longest time I've ever been able to enjoy my actual home (in Philadelphia), my family, my friends,"" he said. ""But it was different. Times were different. You wanted to be more careful, you wanted to be in a situation where you want it to be safe, and understand that you have to be safe with your family.

""But right now, it feels great to be able to get back on the basketball floor with your guys, your teammates, getting the camaraderie back together, and knowing that you're about to do your job.""

The Raptors know that loneliness will be one of the biggest challenges of these unprecedented next few weeks, and so the team put up family photos in each player's room. They've all be appreciative, including Lowry, who said it was reminiscent of the family wall in the Raptors' locker room at Scotiabank Arena, which is plastered with photos of players' kids, spouses, parents and grandparents.

""That's just one thing that the Raptors organization has always kind of implemented is family, your family,"" Lowry said. ""So it's cool. Nice gesture.""

A theme of the NBA's restart will be social and racial justice. The Raptors arrived at Disney World in two buses painted with ""Black Lives Matter"" in big block letters. Lowry participated in a huge protest last month in Philadelphia.

""We are in a time where we need to keep that conversation going. We need to be heard from. We need to speak loud and clear,"" he said. ""We need to understand that things need to be done for the situation to be changed, laws to be changed.

""For me to be a part of that, that's who I am. I grew up a Black man in America. It's definitely a tough thing to grow up that way, because you never know what could possibly happen to you. You never know if you're going to make it out. For me to be able to talk to you guys is a blessing. So for me to be able to do that, it's my right, my duty and my honour to represent the Black culture.""

Toronto FC played its first match since March on Monday, taking on DC United in Florida where the league has put teams in a bubble. The match was played without fans in the stands and the usual loud cheering that goes with a full stadium.

""It kinda sucks,"" said fan Vlad Islamov. ""(The) best way to explain, there are games playing so you can watch it, while you watch it at home, it is boring.”

CTV News Toronto checked on a few of the footie hot spots where fans usually get together to watch a match, but some had closed due to the pandemic. Others like Cafe Diplomatico in Little Italy, where fans jammed the patio during the World Cup, say it was a business decision to not turn the TC screens on today.

Bartender James Russomammo says that with only half the seats on the patio open due to COVID-19 restrictions, the restaurant needs to turn them over.

""We didn't put the screens back up, we weren't able to get as many tables open as we usually have, so (with) the screens down, more people can use the patio, quicker table time. To come and have dinner it's an hour and a half (to) two hours and if you stay to watch a game, it's going to be three hours""

Jennifer Phillips tuned into the match on TV at home today, but says she would rather be around people.

""I was watching a little bit this morning, it was good but you still miss the comradery of people being in the bars and patios, just the feel of it is more energizing.""

Vlad Islamov says it is not the same when you are not surrounded by like-minded people.

""Soccer is an experience. It does miss out, not being able to go to a bar and not having fans around me, you just miss out on that fundamental watching experience.

But the fans generally say that this is better than nothing.",[],344,0.9562924966993026

""It's going to fill up at least two hotels and probably more for several weeks.”

In April, the city projected a $1.5 billion loss in revenue this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The mayor described that figure as a ""best-case scenario.""

The NHL and NHL Players' Association announced that they have ratified return-to-play protocols, which include Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities, and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement.

""While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,"" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement.

""We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.""

TSN hockey insider Bob McKenzie said the agreement gives players and team owners a six-year runway to repair the significant economic damage done by COVID-19 to the league.

""I'm sure there are players that don't love everything about this return to play or this CBA. And I'm sure there are some owners that don't love it either,"" McKenzie said.

""But when you weigh the decision that had to be made in terms of two years of economic Armageddon, and then an uncertain future after that versus six years of knowing how you're going to manage the economics of the game, well, obviously that was the choice that both the owners and the players made.""

The mayor credited the league and Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment for making this happen. He said both organizations went through a painstaking process to satisfy all medical officers of health in all levels of government.

""There were a lot of requirements. Nobody was going to let this happen without making sure that you can keep all the players and all the officials and everybody safe, but also all the people of those cities, Edmonton and Toronto,"" Tory said.

He believes the modified NHL season will be a good national unifier.

""It is going to put the spotlight on Toronto across North America in terms of the hockey world. When people do start visiting again, they'll once again see our city like they did when the Raptors were in the finals last year,"" he said.

In late March, the Ontario government allowed all restaurants to sell takeout alcohol alongside food to help them weather the COVID-19 lockdown. Some outlets that sell rare wines and spirits say customers are jumping at the chance to take home products that government-run liquor stores rarely carry.

Shamez Amlani, co-owner of La Palette, a French bistro in downtown Toronto, said his restaurant is selling more wine than it has in 20 years of business. Amlani said he sold 120 bottles in a single day near the start of the pandemic.

""Before, (my supplies) would have lasted me for months and months, but now I can go through them in a couple weeks,"" he said, adding his customers are drawn to the value of takeout wines versus the cost of dining in.

""If you were to spend $40 to $50 in a restaurant, you'd get the house wine or maybe the second-cheapest wine. But now, if you were to pull out $40 to $50, you're getting access to some pretty thrilling product that you might otherwise not know about.""

Glenn Wesley, the owner of Bathurst Local, a Toronto bar that specializes in imported sake, wine and craft beer, said his restaurant will rely on takeout sales even after the pandemic is over because the extra income will help it recover financially from the lockdown.

In fact, the bar has rebranded as an e-commerce platform where it offers provincewide shipping for its drinks.

""I'd expect it to be a vital point of anyone's business model for the foreseeable future,"" said Wesley.

He said he'd also expect the industry to push back against any moves to scale back takeout alcohol laws as lockdown measures are lifted.

""I would be really surprised if they took it away at any point,"" said Wesley. ""It's the new norm, and I don't think there's been a problem with it so far. Customers have really loved it, and so what would be the reason behind taking it away?""

A spokeswoman for the Ministry of the Attorney General reiterated that the takeout law is a temporary measure that ends on the last day of 2020, but did not say whether an extension is being considered.

""As Ontario carefully moves towards recovery, the government continues to work with licensed establishments to support a thriving hospitality industry in Ontario,"" Jenessa Crognali said in a statement.

""The health and well-being of Ontarians continues to be our top priority.""

But as more restaurants build a customer base around takeout alcohol, some owners said they won't let things go back to normal without a fuss.

Stuart Sakai, who runs Sakai Bar in Toronto, said his bar gives customers a personal experience when buying drinks.

He said customers pay a marked-up price to experience the environment when they dine in, and part of that can be carried over when taking drinks home from a small restaurant.

""The thing I've enjoyed doing very much is trying to continue that experience,"" said Sakai, who says 500 people subscribe to a newsletter that advertises his imported sake offerings.

""When they come and pick it up, maybe we chat about it for a while, they still get that experience part of it. I think people do very much enjoy that.""

Sakai said takeout sales might only be a supplemental form of income in the long term, but like other restaurant owners he said he'd like to see the new rules made permanent.

Amlani, who runs the French bistro, said he had spoken with his local member of provincial parliament about takeout laws even before they were implemented.

""I don't see why we should go back to what it was before,"" said Amlani.

""I will fight to keep this once Jan. 1 comes rolling around.""

The motion was presented to city council last week—with the support of Toronto Mayor John Tory and Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa—in an effort to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 as more businesses start to reopen in the city.

Here's what you need to know:

When do you need to wear a mask?

According to the mayor, the masks will be mandatory in all public and enclosed indoor spaces. This means they will be required on public transportation such as the TTC and ferries to the Toronto Islands, as well as inside shops, grocery stores and malls.

Toronto residents will not need to wear masks while at home, eating on a restaurant patio and at most workplaces where physical distancing is possible. It would also not apply to child-care centres.

“It is about public spaces where the general public has free and ready access, to try and limit the risk,” de Villa said.

While not mentioned in the bylaw, health officials have previously said that residents should wear a mask anytime where it is challenging to social distance from others.

What happens if I can’t wear a mask for health reasons?

All health officials and politicians agree that if someone is suffering from a medical condition that makes it difficult to breathe or function while wearing a mask, they should not wear one. They ask that those people try their best to remain physically distanced from others while in public spaces.

Children under the age of two also do not have to wear a mask.

When will the bylaw take effect?

The bylaw will take effect on July 7 and last until the first city council meeting of the fall, which is scheduled for the end of September or early October. At that time, council will either extend the bylaw, amend it or discontinue it.

What does this mean for schools reopening in early September?

Local health officials say the decision about whether or not children or teachers wear masks while in school is up to the provincial government. The Ontario government, in response to the mandatory mask policy, has said that it is actually up to each individual school board to decide on classroom policies.

“Each board right across the province has the flexibility,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Tuesday. “Everyone is going to have different guidelines.”

Will there be a fine for not wearing a mask?

The mayor admitted there would not be “aggressive enforcement” when it comes to the mask policy, but rather his government will focus on education.

“To be candid about it we don’t really have the resources to go around and look at every store and look at every person that is in one of those places,” he said. “We are going to rely on people by and large to get educated and to do the right thing.”

At the same time, Tory said that it is up to every business to have a policy in place to ensure compliance, suggesting a “no shirt, no shoes, no mask, no service” model.

Who else is doing this?

The mayors of Brampton, Mississauga and Caledon also announced on Tuesday they intend to pass similar bylaws requiring masks to be worn inside public spaces.

Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown said the bylaw in his city could be in effect by July 7.

No timeline has been provided for the bylaw in Mississauga or Caledon.

Why is it not mandated provincially?

The Ford government has said they will not be requiring the wearing of masks, but rather will encourage their use. Speaking on Tuesday, the premier said that the needs of regions like Peel and Toronto will be different from those in northern Ontario, which is why he can’t make masks mandatory.

“But each region has the authority to make their own rules,” he said. “I will support them on any decision that they make.”

Why is this policy necessary?

Experts have said that wearing a mask will prevent the wearer from spraying droplets on others, helping curb the transmission of the disease if they are asymptomatic.

De Villa said that requiring masks in indoor settings is essential to preventing the spread of COVID-19, but that compliance will need to be as high as 80 per cent in order to work.

“The reality is that the virus continues to circulate and that we still need to be careful,” she said.

According to a report by Canada’s national statistics agency issued on Wednesday, about eight in 10 Ontario respondents—or about 78 per cent—said they would wear a mask if physical distancing were not possible.

Fewer than 70 per cent of respondents from other regions reported that they would wear a mask in crowded places, with Quebec residents at the bottom of the list at about 52 per cent.

The majority of Ontario respondents also said they have been avoiding large gatherings (89.4 per cent) and remaining two metres away from others (87.3 per cent).

The data shows that only 65 per cent of respondents in Quebec, which borders Ontario, say they keep a two-metre distance from others.

Statistic Canada also found that Canadians living in rural areas were less likely to report that they would wear masks in public compared to those living in urban areas—a fact that may be governed by the sheer difference in the number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario and Quebec compared to the rest of the country.

As of Wednesday, more than 92,000 of Canada’s 106,166 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases can be found in those two provinces.

While there are regional discrepancies for some health safety measures, the majority of Canadians appear to agree that hand washing is a priority.

More than 90 per cent of survey respondents across all regions said they wash their hands more frequently now in an effort to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus with Ontario leading at 95.4 per cent.

Statistics Canada said that this data suggests “this measure has been widely adopted by most Canadians.”

About four in 10 workers in Canada feel unsafe returning to work

The survey found that about 38 per cent of Canadian workers reported not feeling safe enough to return to work due to the pandemic.

“The most commonly-reported reasons for not feeling safe were fear of contracting the virus and fear of infecting family members,” the survey said.

In Quebec and Ontario, more than 40 per cent of workers reported feeling unsafe about returning to work compared with the approximately 25 per cent in other regions.

The online survey was conducted by Statistics Canada between June 15 and June 21 and is the third poll since the pandemic was declared in March. In the report, Statistics Canada noted that “not all Canadians were equally likely to report that they would follow precautions in the context of activities resuming.”

Men were generally less likely than women to report whether they would follow COVID-19 health precautions, the report found, and young Canadians between the ages of 15 and 24 were less likely to report whether they would wear a mask or remain physically distanced from others.",[],467,0.8533246934742786

Ford said he is involved in active talks with Ottawa to secure funding for municipalities strapped for cash due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Municipal leaders said earlier this week that an aid package from both upper levels of government is needed to prevent tax increases and service cuts.

The premier said he is not willing to settle for the current federal offer because it is more than a billion dollars short of what's needed to help shore up Ontario communities.

""If I walked away, the municipalities wouldn't be too happy with the amount that the federal government's offering right now,"" Ford said.

The premier said Ontario represents 38 per cent of Canada's population, and he believes it should receive the equivalent to that in the federal deal.

""I don't rush a bad deal,"" he said.

Some municipalities have expressed frustration in recent months that they are stuck in the middle of a lingering stand-off between the federal and Ontario governments over the aid package.

The municipal leaders have said $10 billion is needed for communities across the country, including Ontario, and federal and provincial governments must resolve their differences before cuts and fee hikes are needed.

A spokeswoman for Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the federal government recognizes municipalities face serious financial pressures.

""We have offered $14 billion to support Canadians and we hope we can soon conclude an agreement with all the premiers that will ensure this funding is delivered to those who need it,"" Katherine Cuplinskas said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Ford's government introduced a sweeping new piece of legislation Wednesday it said will help the province's economy recover from the pandemic.

The omnibus bill -- dubbed the COVID-19 Recovery Act -- proposes to change 20 pieces of current legislation that govern the province's schools, municipalities, and justice system.

Municipal Affairs Minister Steve Clark said if passed, the bill would speed up environmental assessments, offer new consumer protections and help address unemployment.

Ford defended the bill and said it will help change an environmental assessment process that has been on the books for decades.

""We aren't going to dodge (environmental assessments) or anything,"" he said. ""We're going to make sure we strengthen them, but we're going to do them quicker, smarter.""

Clark said the bill would also create an economic agency -- Invest Ontario -- to help attract more international investment to the province.

The 188 page bill also includes measures announced by Education Minister Stephen Lecce this week to end school suspensions for students in junior kindergarten to Grade 3.

Clark said with limited days of sitting at the provincial legislature, it made sense to combined the different changes into one package.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the bill isn't actually a pandemic recovery plan at all, and is short on rent relief, solutions for long-term care, and details on schools required to truly help Ontarians.

""I'm worried that Doug Ford is using the COVID-19 recovery as cover to plow ahead with changes that have nothing at all to do with recovering from this pandemic,"" she said.

Green party Leader Mike Schreiner said changing environmental regulations is not necessary to get the economy moving.

""Caring for nature, farmland and water is a vital part of the economic recovery, not something we sacrifice,"" he said in a statement.

The government also tabled a motion on Wednesday to extend the province's state of emergency until July 24.

The current state of emergency declared at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic is set to expire July 15.

Ford's office said the government wants to extend the measure to ensure there is no gap between that declaration ending and a new bill extending Ontario's emergency measures taking effect.

Solicitor General Sylvia Jones introduced that bill on Tuesday, saying the province will need to keep some emergency measures in place in the months ahead.

Ontario reported 118 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, and nine new deaths due to the novel coronavirus.

The total number of cases now stands at 36,178, which includes 31,805 marked as resolved and 2,700 deaths.

The province also reported 202 newly resolved cases, and completed more than 22,832 tests for the novel coronavirus over the previous 24 hours.

The number of people in hospital because of the virus, in intensive care units and on ventilators all slightly decreased.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said 30 of the province's 34 public health units reported five or fewer new cases, with 18 reporting none.

Canadian volunteers with GlobalMedic are now working to assemble and send emergency food kits to those in need.

About 1,400 families in areas that were affected by Category 5 Hurricane Dorian will be receiving these kits.

The hurricane swept through the island, causing catastrophic damage, on Sept. 1, 2019.

In the months that followed, many people in the Bahamas were left strongly affected by not only the hurricane, but also the sharp decline in the tourism industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some residents were just starting to get their lives back in order six months after the hurricane hit when all of a sudden no one was able to travel to the island anymore, leading to many people losing their jobs.

The global shutdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed, and in some cases stopped, any progress made in rebuilding on the island, according to GlobalMedic.

Rahul Singh, the executive director of GlobalMedic, said these volunteers are now trying to help feed those in need, which he calls a step in the right direction.

The emergency food kits being assembled by the volunteers include grains, beans, rice, peas, and grits. The kits will be loaded onto a shipping container on Wednesday before being railed onto a boat in Halifax and then shipped out to the harbour in Freeport, Bahamas.",[],236,0.9851299646047208

“Prom would have been tomorrow and commencement the day after, so there is really no sense of closure in a way,” said Nelson Lee, who is graduating from Marc Garneau Collegiate .

Nelson is the student council president at his Toronto high school and had been planning the end-of-year celebrations long before the pandemic.

“It doesn’t feel as fulfilling,” he said about missing out on so many school events, graduation and other extracurricular opportunities.

He has been accepted to the University of Toronto’s Engineering program. He’s excited about the next chapter, but acknowledges it won’t be normal.

“The university has sent out a lot of information about they will proceed in September, for the larger classes they will be online and smaller seminars will be in person,” he said. “I think it’s a great combination for the best of both worlds at this time.”

In the meantime, with limited options due to the pandemic, he’s taking courses offered by UofT to prepare him for his first semester.

“Just to keep myself engage and push myself to learn new things during this time.”

Students organize virtual prom

Zaiboon Azhar wanted to make sure her classmates had the opportunity to celebrate their achievement. The Woburn Collegiate graduate was part of a national committee that organized a virtual prom with an open invitation to every high school student across Canada.

“The idea was to give the class of 2020 some sort of prom, graduation experience because it is difficult being all alone at home for months without access to your friends - we wanted to make these seniors feel special,” Azhar said.

The online event called ‘Prom is On’ was held in May and raised more than $150,000 for Kids Help Phone.

Azhar will attend the University of Toronto in the fall to study international relations.

Schools honour students with virtual graduation

Some schools are hosting virtual graduation ceremonies to celebrate their students achievements.

Bayview Middle School is hoisting a virtual graduation Tuesday evening, giving staff and students one last opportunity to connect.

“It means a lot to me because I will see my teachers talk one last time, just knowing I’m going to be present there with all my classmates and peers,” Grade 8 student Nadine Al-Junaidi said.

Nadine’s classmate Pradyumn Jha is equally excited about the opportunity to see friends one last time before going their separate ways to different high schools.

“For the past three years I’ve been thinking about this moment and having it virtual is showing how in these unprecedented times we’re being innovative and its better than no graduation,” Pradyumn said. “I’m looking forward to the new experiences and meeting new people, the new environment.”

Transitioning to high school can be anxious and exciting for students under normal circumstance. However, with the province recently announcing measures for the school year that include smaller class sizes and remote learning at home, these students don’t know what to expect.

“I’m a little bit nervous about what grade nine will hold and we still might be doing online learning, so I will have to see how it will go,” Nadine said. “It’s not how I hope to start high school career.”

If anything, these graduates say the pandemic has taught them to persevere.

Currently, high school students in Ontario are asked to choose between more practical, hands-on applied courses and more theoretical academic courses in core subjects like math, science and English.

The practice has been a subject of much debate, with critics arguing that the streaming process has disproportionately impacted racialized and low-income students, resulting in lower graduation rates and test scores.

Speaking at Queen’s Park on Thursday afternoon, Ford said academic streaming “can exclude a student form a world of opportunities later in life.”

He went on to state that the phasing out of streaming will begin in September 2021, starting with Grade 9 math courses. A new math curriculum for the de-streamed class will be unveiled at a later date, the government said.

“Our Black, Indigenous and racialized students face more social and economic barriers to success than their fellow students and that’s just not right,” Ford said. “They deserve the same shot at their dreams as any other young person.”

Ford also said that it was “unfair” and “not right” to ask students to make a decision at the age of 14 that could determine the course of their high school and post-secondary careers.

No further details have been provided regarding a timeline for the de-streaming of other core subjects or what the new curriculum will look like.

Ontario’s Advocate for Community Opportunities Jamil Jivani praised the policy, saying that he was streamed as a teenager and knows first-hand the impact the process can have on students.

“I was put into applied courses. And I know that very few people who experience streaming in our schools ever make it to a place like this, standing before you at an official podium alongside the premier of Ontario,” Jivani said. “By the grace of God I am here.”

Every student – irrespective of the colour of their skin, socio-economic status, heritage, or orientation – deserves to achieve their full potential.



We are breaking down barriers that have held students back for too long.

Teachers’ unions and advocates of the change have said that while they approve of ending streaming, they want to know more about what kind of supports will be available for both students and teachers.

Advocacy group People for Education, who has been lobbying for an end to streaming for years, said earlier this week that further details are needed about how students with different learning styles will be supported during the transition.

“You can’t just flip a switch,” spokesperson Annie Kidder said.

The change also comes as teachers are struggling to learn a new math curriculum for students in Grade 1 to Grade 8 in September 2020 while also adjusting to a new yet-to-be-decided educational format that would deal with the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Ford government is also proposing additional and mandatory anti-racism and anti-discrimination training before the end of the calendar year.

A day earlier, the government has also introduced a bill that would ban the suspension of students in junior kindergarten up until Grade 3 for “non-serious offences.” The motion is part of a larger omnibus bill that is meant to help the province deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic once the state of emergency has been lifted.

But, according to experts, the costliest tax mistakes made by Canadians are usually related to missed deductions and a lack of understanding about whether they need to file.

Here are five costly mistakes to avoid when putting together your return this year:

NOT FILING AT ALL

If you didn’t make a single dime during the tax year, failing to file a tax return will only leadto more money being left on the table.

“One of the most common mistakes is not filing because you don’t think you have enough income, or you didn’t have an income at all,” Lisa Gittens, senior tax professional at H&R Block, told CTVNews.ca by phone earlier this month.

“As long as you are living in Canada you should be filing.”

According to Gittens, students, young adults, stay-at-home parents and the unemployed are the most prone to this mistake, which prevents them from claiming certain tax credits and benefits that all Canadians are entitled to, regardless of their income bracket.

This includes the Canada child benefit, the universal child care benefit, and the GST/HST credit, and provincial credits like the Climate Action Incentive. Keep in mind that both parents must file a tax return in order to receive the Canada child benefit.

You can also claim things like medical expenses, educational expenses, and child care expenses if you didn’t make any income. And, as Gittens notes, the more expenses you can write off, the greater chance you'll get a refund.

Gittens notes that it’s especially important for students to file their returns in order to build credit with the CRA.

“Many students don’t file because they have no income, but once they graduate and start earning income, they have no credit with the CRA,” she explained.

NOT CLAIMING MEDICAL EXPENSES

Medical expenses not covered by provincial health services or benefits plans are another commonly neglected area, especially for low- and middle-income Canadians.

“When your medical expenses are high in comparison to your income you get a medical expense supplement that refunds a portion of the medical expenses you claimed,” said Gittens.

This type of expense can include eye exams, dental expenses not covered by insurance, medical supplies and travel expenses. This year, certain cannabis products are now considered eligible for the medical expense tax credit, if you have a prescription.

You can claim your total eligible medical expenses, minus three per cent of your income or the set maximum for the tax year ($2,352), whichever is less.

For future tax years, Gittens recommends completing all of your miscellaneous medical exams and yearly check-ups towards the end of the year to capitalize on the return and make it easier to organize your receipts.

“When you get all of those eye exams and dental exams taken care of at the end of the year the receipts are all there for you to claim on your taxes,” she said.

MISREPORTING INCOME FROM YOUR SIDE JOB

Whether you are making extra money by driving an Uber, hosting people at your Airbnb, or earning a little side cash online, you want to make sure you are recording those earnings as self-employed income.

“You’ll want to be sure that you’re also contributing to the Canada Pension Plan based on those earnings,” notes Gittens.

If you plan on claiming any expenses related to that income (i.e. expenses related to your vehicle, house, or travel expenses), make sure that you have the receipts to back it up.

MISSING INVESTMENT INCOME

Before filing, make note of your investment streams and make sure you have received a statement for each of them. These annual statements should show the total income you earned during the tax year and the total expenses incurred, such as investment adviser fees (which are deductible).

“Income sometimes gets missed because people don’t understand how much they’ve earned on their investments each year,” Armando Minicucci, tax specialist at Grant Thornton, told CTVNews.ca by phone.

“This is generally the most common area where individual tax payers are reassessed.”

FILING TOO EARLY

The early bird doesn’t always get the worm, especially when it comes to taxes.

“Those early filers who are hoping to get their refunds right away tend to miss certain documents, whether it be T4’s from their employers or investment slips from the bank,” Michael Davis, senior tax specialist at H&R Block, told CTVNews.ca by phone.

Not only could this cause you to make an amendment to your return, it could put you at risk of incurring penalties for misreporting your income if you make a habit of it.

“If you fail to report the same kind of income in back-to-back years it could result in penalties,” said Davis.

April 30 is the last day to file your 2019 income tax return. If you owe the CRA money, it must be paid by this date. Otherwise, you’ll face a late-filing penalty and daily interest chargeson your balance.

If you are self-employed, you have until June 15 to file your return. But keep in mind that if you owe taxes, you’ll still be required to pay your balance by the April 30 deadline.",[],854,0.9265739877298501

The T1 General Form, also known as the Income Tax and Benefit Return, is the main document used to file your personal income taxes and acts as a summary of all the other forms you complete for your income taxes.

Depending on how you’ve filed your tax return in years past, you might be familiar with the general layout of the form.

But during the 2020 tax season the form will look quite different – most notably, doubling in size.

WHAT IS A T1 GENERAL FORM?

The T1 is used to summarize all of the other forms you complete for your income taxes.

It shows your provincial tax (except in Quebec), total income, net income, tax payable, deductions, and non-refundable credits.

When you file your taxes, this form is used to apply for things such as the Canada Child Benefit, or the GST/HST credit.

If you file your taxes online using tax software, you may not recognize the name of the T1 form because it’s often filled out automatically.

“If you use tax software or go to your tax professional all of the calculations are done in the background,” Lisa Gittens, senior tax professional at H&R Block, told CTVNews.ca by phone.

“The purpose [of the redesign] was to simplify the preparation and that process has already been simplified if you’re using online software.”

In other words, unless you are dedicated to filing your taxes by pen and paper, you won’t even notice the change.

WHAT’S DIFFERENT?

As the CRA puts it, “Your income tax package has a new look.”

The first thing you will likely notice is that the form has doubled in size from four pages to eight. Additionally, some of the line numbers that were previously three or four digits long are now five digits long.

The CRA notes that the form has been updated to include the use of plain language “where possible,” reduce the number of forms, update worksheets to simplify certain calculations, and increase font size and white space.

The form now also includes the calculation of federal tax.

“Most Canadians aren’t going to notice much of a difference, other than the extra pages and new line numbers,” Armando Minicucci, tax specialist at Grant Thornton, told CTVNews.ca.

“Two of the new pages are from adding the non-refundable tax schedule to the form.”

Page one of the form still asks for your basic personal information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, province of residency, marital status and information about your spouse or partner.

The second page now asks whether you have any income that is exempt under the Indian Act. If you do, you will not be required to complete the T90 form, “Income Exempt under the Indian Act.”

The rest of the T1 form requires the same information as previous years, including various deductions such as RRSP contributions and child-care expenses, the calculation of your net income and your taxable income.

Gittens notes that the calculation of these reductions is the most important part of the T1 form and remains completely unchanged from previous years.

The remainder of the form is dedicated to calculating your federal tax.

April 30 is the last day to file your 2019 income tax return. If you owe the Canada Revenue Agency money, it must be paid by this date. Otherwise, you’ll face a late-filing penalty and daily interest charges on your balance.

Other changes to CRA services this tax year include a new online tool that allows you to check the estimated processing time for your tax return and other tax-related requests, and the ability to pay your balance via PayPal.

Whether you are working with a tax specialist or using software to file your taxes, it’s important to be aware of any changes that could affect your refund.

But first, let’s start with the basics.

IMPORTANT DATES AND DEADLINES

As usual, April 30 is the last day to file your 2019 income tax return. If you owe the Canada Revenue Agency money, it must be paid by this date. Otherwise, you’ll face a late-filing penalty and daily interest charges on your balance.

The CRA notes that even if you can’t pay your full balance owing on or before April 30, you can avoid the late-filing penalty by filing your return on time.

If you are self-employed, you have until June 15 to file your return. But keep in mind that if you owe taxes, you’ll still be required to pay your balance by the April 30 deadline.

The deadline to contribute to your registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) is March 2.

CHANGES TO CRA SERVICES

Right off the bat, you might notice a few changes to the T1 Personal Income Tax return form. Most notably, it’s doubled in size from four pages to eight.

But this doesn’t mean you’ll be required to put in extra work. The length accounts for increased font size and new formatting, as well as the CRA’s decision to include the calculation of federal tax. There is also a new numbering system.

“Most Canadians aren’t going to notice much of a difference, other than the extra pages and new line numbers” Armando Minicucci, tax specialist at Grant Thornton, told CTVNews.ca.

The CRA has also released a new online tool that allows you to check the estimated processing time for your tax return and other tax-related requests.

You now also have the option of setting a personal identification number through the My Account portal to quickly identify yourself when calling the CRA.

GETTING ORGANIZED

If you haven’t done so already, experts suggest signing up for the CRA’s My Account portal to ensure that all of your personal information is up to date and accurate. This portal not only stores important tax income documents, it allows you to check the status of your refunds, outstanding balances, and RRSP or TFSA contribution limits.

More importantly, if you have misplaced any of your documents or T-slips, you should be able to access them in My Account.

Next, organize your paperwork.

· Employment and income slips (T4s, T4As, T5s, T3s, etc.)

· Receipts to back up claims for things like medical or childcare costs, charitable donations, or moving expenses

· Disability certificates, mortgage and property tax statements

· Self-employed or rental income and expense information

· Student tuition and interest documents

Reporting investment income tends to be the trickiest area for taxpayers, according to Minicucci.

“Income sometimes gets missed because people don’t understand how much they’ve earned on their investments each year,” he said. “This is generally the most common area where individual taxpayers are reassessed.”

You should have received an annual statement from any investments you held in 2019 showing the total income you earned during the year and the total expenses incurred, such as investment adviser fees (which are deductible).

NEW AND IMPROVED TAX BREAKS

Enhanced CPP Contributions: You can now claim a deduction for any enhanced contributions to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP).

“Employees were required to contribute 0.15 per cent of pensionable earnings commencing last January to a maximum annual contribution of $80.85,” explained Minicucci.

“Regular contributions to CPP result in a non-refundable tax credit. The deduction for enhanced contributions is a tax deduction, not a tax credit.”

Canada Workers Benefit: Formerly known as the Working Income Tax Benefit, this benefit provides a refundable tax credit for individuals and families that are in the workforce but have income below certain thresholds.

The maximum benefit is $1,335 for individuals with earned income of $12,820 or less. For families, the maximum refund is $2,335 with an income threshold of no more than $17,025. However, if you are enrolled in a full-time education program, you’re not eligible.

Home Buyers’ Plan: In 2019 the Home Buyers’ Plan RRSP withdrawal limit increased from $25,000 to $35,000 for withdrawals made after March 19.

New homeowners also qualify for the $5,000 first-time Home Buyers’ Tax Credit if they have purchased a home in the tax year—a tax credit Minicucci warns could be overlooked by many first-time buyers.

Cannabis as a Medical Expense: Certain cannabis products are now considered eligible for the medical expense tax credit, providing you have an authorization.

Climate Action Incentive: The perks of this incentive program range depending on which province you live in. Albertans are now eligible to claim this incentive, whereas residents in New Brunswick will not. Residents in Ontario, Saskatchewan and Manitoba will receive a large amount this year compared to the previous tax season.",[],826,0.9142262339084463

Not only is there pressure to file your tax return accurately and on-time, you’re doling out vast amounts of sensitive personal information online while doing so.

Practising good personal data protection etiquette online should be top of mind for consumers year-round. But it becomes increasingly important during tax season, when cybercriminals tend to prey on consumers who are more likely to fall for scams that ask for their personal information.

Here are some important security measures to keep in mind while handling your personal information online this tax season:

BE WARY OF SCAMS

Canadians have faced an influx of online scams and robocalls purporting to be from federal organizations including the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) over the last few years.

These scams often threaten consumers with the imminent threat of arrest or lawsuit before asking for a litany of personal information, such as social insurance numbers.

In 2019, Canadians lost more than $1.4 million to CRA scams, according to numbers provided to CTVNews.ca by the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC). In fact, as of Feb. 2, the CAFC had confirmed 34 successful instances of CRA fraud in 2020, costing consumers over $10,000 total.

“A lot of the scams take place over email and SMS,” Christine Beauchamp, director of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, told CTVNews.ca in a telephone interview.

“They have a variety of messages that make them seem very legitimate and professional. You might not be able to tell right away whether or not they’re legitimate.”

When it comes to online scams in particular, the CRA says it will never:

Ask for prepaid credit cards or gift cards.

Collect or distribute payment via e-transfer or bitcoin.

Send an email with a link that asks you to divulge personal or financial information, unless you have called the CRA to ask for a form or a link for information. In this case, a CRA agent would send you an email during the call with that information.

Beauchamp adds that users should never click on links included in suspicious emails, especially if it’s not a secure link.

Sites with a secure connection will display a lock symbol in the left hand side of the URL bar in your web browser. Secure sites will also start with “https” (the “s” stands for secure).

USE SECURE PASSWORDS

Your income tax return contains a wealth of incredibly sensitive personal information -- perfect for anyone who wants to steal your identity.

“If there is one password you want to keep incredibly strong and unique, I would say it’s definitely the one that’s associated with your tax return file,” Beauchamp said.

Whether you are filing online through the CRA’s website, or using a third-party program to help you with your return, make sure that you use a password that is eight to 10 upper- and lower-case letters mixed with numbers. That’s the formula experts say is most secure.

When choosing numbers to add to your password, be sure not to use anything that is easily identifiable, such as your address or date of birth.

If you have a hard time remembering your passwords, Beauchamp suggests stringing together three or four random words you’ll remember, which is often as strong as an alphanumerical password.

SAVE YOUR FILES SECURELY

When filing your taxes online, be mindful of where you save the PDF copy of your return and any supporting documents.

If possible, Beauchamp recommends storing these files on an encrypted external hard drive or a secure drive in the documents section of your computer. Files that are saved on your computer’s desktop are not as protected as those stored in the documents folders.

Experts don’t recommend storing these kinds of personal documents in the cloud.

Keep in mind that you should be filing your return from a secure internet connection and not from a public Wi-Fi connection.

Public Wi-Fi networks are highly susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle-style attacks, which allow eavesdroppers to intercept data transmissions and read them.

EDUCATE YOURSELF

The CRA has an entire website dedicated to helping Canadians protect themselves against fraud, including information about the most common scams.

Tax season is prime time for scammers,'Nicole Bogart',2020-02-10 06:00:00-05:00,"TORONTO -- Canadians who have grown tired of unsolicited emails and phone calls from scammers claiming they owe money to federal agencies will have their patience tested this tax season.

The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) is expecting to see a surge in these scams between March and April, when cybercriminals tend to prey on consumers who are more likely to fall for scams that ask for their personal informationduring tax season.

According to numbers provided to CTVNews.ca, 470 Canadians lost more than $1.4 million to these scams last year alone.

Another 3,210 complaints of scammers posing as the tax agency were reported to the CAFC in 2019, but the CAFC notes that thousands more go unreported.

Jeff Thompson, a senior RCMP intelligence agent working for the CAFC, says that scams that mention the CRA are just the tip of the iceberg.

“There’s the telephone CRA scam that we continue to get reports about, but we’ve seen a huge shift with [scammers] claiming to be Service Canada reporting fraud on your SIN number,” Thompson told CTVNews.ca in a telephone interview.

Thompson said CRA-related scams often involve phishing campaigns sent by email or text message, many with the promise of a tax return in the form of an e-transfer -- something the CRA says it will never do.

But despite increased effort by Canadians authorities and government officials to crack down on these types of scams, including a large scale bust involving more than 40 illegal call centres in India last March, experts fear the market for fraud outpaces authoritative efforts.

“It is a little bit like a drop of a bucket -- a game of whack-a-mole. You take out one group and another pops up,” Avner Levin, director of Ryerson University’s Privacy and Cybercrime Institute, told CTVNews.ca in a telephone interview.

“All they need is a handful of successful scams to make money. And if you’re talking about sending out an email or a text message the costs are negligible.”

Avner says some relief may come from more stringent requirements placed on telecom providers by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), including call-blocking technology that prevents some “spoofed” numbers from reaching Canadians customers.

“This isn’t an issue you can solve on your own by blocking calls on your own device. You need the telecom companies to get involved and do their part,” Avner said.

Meanwhile, as scammers ramp up for busy season, Avner’s best piece of advice is simple: don’t answer your phoneif you don’t recognize the number.

“The scam is in the social context… the person gets on the phone and intimidates you, stresses you out, convinces you to do things you wouldn’t do,” he said.

“You’ve got to find ways to disengage and disconnect. The more you stay on the line and have a conversation with them, even if you think you’re impervious to this, they will chip away at it.”

In a statement to CTVNews.ca, a CRA spokesperson said education is key when it comes to protecting Canadians from these types of scams.

The CRA says it will never:

Use aggressive language or threaten to arrest or deport you .

Ask for prepaid credit cards or gift cards.

Collect or distribute payment through e-transfers or bitcoins.

Send an email with a link that asks you to divulge personal or financial information, unless you have called the CRA to ask for a form or a link for information. In this case, a CRA agent would send you an email during the call with that information.

The CAFC notes that users should never click on links included in suspicious emails, especially if it’s not a secure link.Sites with a secure connection will display a lock symbol in the left hand side of the URL bar in your web browser. Secure sites will also start with “https” (the “s” stands for secure).

But Levin notes that consumers should continue to be vigilant after filing their taxes, noting that cybercriminals are ready to strike at any time.

“There is some risk when you’re filing your taxes, but afterwards, when you’re awaiting a return, we also see a huge spike in these types of scams,” he said.

Here are some quick tips to charge your phone faster,"""Cillian O'Brien""",2018-10-09 06:10:00-04:00,"Smartphone batteries often seem to run low when we need them most – so we’ve gathered some tips on charging them up pronto.

If you need a fast charge there are ways to get that battery closer to 100 per cent.

For iPhone and Android users alike, the less your phone processor is doing, the faster it will charge. So putting it into airplane mode can help, but will mean no internet or cellular connectivity.

Aside from turning your phone into a virtual paper weight, there are more shortcuts to a faster charge.

The phone screen is the biggest battery drain, so resist the urge to keep looking at it, if you can.

But if the temptation is too much, and you can’t do without the web while it’s charging, just turn off the battery-draining Bluetooth, wifi, GPS and NFC features instead.

Older phones charge faster when they’re powered down completely, but this is no longer true on new phones.

Tech reporter Amber Mac told CTVNews.ca that phone manufacturers have made fast charging a priority in recent years.

“While many smartphone buyers look for the best camera or screen, I am always interested in the device with the best battery life,” Mac told CTVNews.ca, praising the all-day battery life of her own smartphone.

“If I do need a boost, it has fast charging so that in 30 minutes or so I can get up to 50 per cent of my battery life back again.”

While Apple’s smartphones don’t have a fast-charge feature built in, iPhone users can charge their devices quicker by using a different wall plug.

IPhones are sold with Apple’s small five-volt/one-amp power bricks, but iPads come with larger five-volt/2.4-amp bricks that actually charge the company’s phones faster.

Electricity is measured in watts, which is a product of voltage (in number of volts) and current (in number of amps).

Some chargers supply more voltage or amperage than others, meaning they will charge your phone faster.

That means, if you want to charge up your Apple device as fast as possible, you’ll need a Lightning-to-USB-C cable and a 12 watt USB-C power adapter.

Other phone brands offer special fast chargers, but they are typically incompatible between different manufacturers.

Newer Android devices also have a battery saving mode that users can activate to shut off background apps and conserve power while the phone recharges.

Anyone who’s tried to charge their phone in a hot car knows that the handsets run the risk of overheating and some models will stop charging. So keep it cool for a speedier charge.

Similarly, if your battery is in a cold environment, you may notice the charge start to decrease.

For a fast charge it’s best to plug into a wall socket, but if that’s not an option, an active laptop is the next best thing.

And if all else fails, leave the house with a portable charger. It won’t charge any faster, but it will charge your phone on the go.",[],477,0.9827685675694557

""I already assume my smartphone is infected,"" Gary Miliefsky, the CEO of SnoopWall, a cybersecurity company based in New Hampshire told CTVNews.ca.

And if a cybersecurity expert’s phone is infected, yours may be too.

From avoiding downloading email attachments to disabling geo-tagging, you may be leaving yourself wide open to hackers. So what simple steps can you take to protect yourself online?

CTVNews.ca spoke to two cybersecurity experts, Miliefsky and technology analyst Carmi Levy, to find out the top 5 things they would never think of doing on their smartphone or computer:

1. Never use your debit card for online shopping

Online retailers are increasingly offering customers a chance to use their debit card to pay for transactions, making life easier for those who don’t have credit cards or for those who don't want to add to their credit debt.

Even PayPal now has an option for users to add their debit cards to their accounts.

This tops Miliefsky’s list of things he would never do on his computer or smartphone.

""If you use a credit card, you're much safer because of the fraud and identity theft investigations and protections designed around credit cards,"" he said.

Miliefsky says he understands people wanting to only use the cash they have readily available, but a hacked debit card is a much more time consuming process to get fixed.

Longer fraud investigations and future identity theft concerns are the major reason to avoid using them online, he says.

2. Never download an app before reading the privacy permissions

When downloading an app, many will skim through the permissions it asks to be granted – such as accessing your contacts or your location.

Both experts suggest reading the privacy permissions and doing some research on the apps' creator before you download it.

Miliefsky lists a keyboard emoji app found on the Google Play store that has hundreds of thousands of downloads as an example. This simple emoji app asks to read all your text messages, listen in on ingoing and outgoing calls and track your movement.

Both Miliefsky and Levy say free apps are particularly troublesome for wanting to control your phone's contents. Many apps also don't list where all the information they gather from your devices is stored.

""We’re essentially giving up all of our rights to in order to play these games,"" said Levy. ""We're allowing companies carte blanche to have our information.""

Instead, research the apps you download and avoid those that wants to oversee a large amount of your phone's content.

3. Never download email attachments

It may sound like a hassle, but Miliefsky suggests never downloading an email attachment.

""If there were no hyperlinks or attachments in an email, how could you get infected in emails?"" he said.

He says people have become used to downloading attachments from people they recognize recognizable, and hackers can exploit that.

Instead, consider using a third party program such as Dropbox – a secure file hosting service – allows you to scan all incoming attachments and ensure you’re not downloading something potentially harmful.

For an extra layer of protection, Miliefsky recommends getting rid of email signatures that feature hyperlinks. Those links can be corrupted and instead of directing the recipient to its intended target, can instead direct them to a site a hacker controls.

4. Never share a password

A fairly straightforward piece of advice, but both Miliefsky and Levy suggest never sharing important passwords online or using the same password twice.

Miliefsky recommends never entering any of your passwords on sites you don't recognize or sharing it with others, while Levy suggests avoid having them stored on your computer.

""Breaking in to your computer, eavesdropping on your computer, getting passwords is just too easy,"" Miliefsky said. ""Just don’t share your password.""

Levy agrees, adding that many users use the same password multiple times, making you an easier target to hack.

""You’re willingly trading off security for convenience when you do this,"" he said.

5. Never enable geo-tagging, GPS and Wi-Fi

A geotag is an electronic tag that lists the geographical location a photo, video or device is located. You may already have enabled your location on your phone and not know it. To disable the feature, simple check your camera settings and disable ""geotags"" or ""location tag.""

But it’s important to be aware if you’ve enabled geo-tagging because you could be giving outsiders a virtual map to your whereabouts if they get their hands on your device, Miliefksy says.

He gives an example of children taking photos on their phones or iPods without realizing the photo is storing their location. If the phone or computer taking that photo has already been hacked or gets hacked, then whoever has control of it can easily discover where you live or where your kids are, he says.

Beyond geotags, using free Wi-Fi is another no-no.

Smartphone users tend to leave their Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection on when it’s not needed, Levy says, which can allow hackers easily taking control devices when you’re out in public.

Hackers can set up fake internet connections in coffee shops to use on unsuspecting customers and easily access that data once the device is connected.

""Even if you’re logging in to a sanctioned network like a one at a coffee shop,"" said Levy referring to Wi-Fi logins at coffee shops like Starbucks. ""The sad truth is these are places that sell coffee, not specialize in Wi-Fi security.""

Both suggest using those, and similar functions on your phone – such as enabling Bluetooth or Near Field Communication, which can pair your device with another -- only when it’s necessary or when it’s on a secure connection.

The only safe connections are those where you know who is in charge of the connection such as your employer or your home router.

While the expert advice may seem ominous, Levy says the idea is to reinforce how important security for our digital devices is, and how it tends to get overlooked.

""I don't want to freak people out, but at the same time I want to frighten people into treating security with a little more seriousness than they already do,"" he said. ""Sometimes you need a bit of a poke to wake up and smell the coffee.""",[],1049,0.9718424554762243
628,https://www.ctvnews.ca/5-things/tech-tuesday-the-best-home-security-cameras-1.2709732,11,plant area garden water lake weather boat rain,1125,ctvnews,Tech Tuesday: The best home-security cameras,'Simon Cohen',2015-12-22 06:00:00-05:00,"Going away for the holidays? Or maybe there’s someone on your list who’s away on business a lot? Then it’s time to think about the biggest trend in smart home devices: remote monitoring video cameras.

Unlike the more commercially oriented multi-camera systems that require complicated wiring and set-ups, these products are designed to use your home WiFi network in combination with a cloud-based storage system and can usually be set up in minutes. While some require subscriptions to enjoy all of their features, some do not. And though they may offer peace of mind, they are not a substitute for a professionally monitored home security system.

Here are some of the leading players in the space and what you need to know before investing in them.

Nest Cam ($219, plus optional Nest Aware subscription starting at $10/month)

The Nest Cam (formerly Drop Cam) is a versatile home monitoring camera that can capture 1080p video, with a wide 130-degree field of view and the ability to see clearly even in low-light situations. These specs aren’t uncommon -- many of its competitors can make the same claims -- but its software and optional cloud-based recording features make the Nest Cam the most popular device of its kind. Once set up, you can view real-time footage from the Nest Cam, use its digital zoom to get closer to the action, or communicate through the camera’s built-in speaker and microphone. You can make your Nest Cam’s feed public and share it with friends and family, making it a clever alternative to FaceTime or Skype for family events.

But if what you really want is to record what’s going while you’re not there, you’ll need the Nest Aware subscription plan, which will run you $10/month for 10 days’ worth of recording, or $30 for 30 days. $120 a year certainly isn’t chump change -- especially if it’s on top of an existing security system monitoring plan -- but it does enable Nest Cam’s best features, such as personal alerts based on criteria like movement (the company claims its software can tell the difference between irrelevant movement like trees moving in the wind and important movement like a person walking through the room). It also gives you impressive extras like the ability to isolate a particular area of the image for alerts, e.g. a precious work of art, or your child’s crib; and time-lapse recordings which let you select any chunk of previously recorded footage and condense it into a 6, 15, 30, 60 or 120-second video. The other thing to keep in mind is that, with Nest Aware, your camera can record continuously for the entire 10-or-30 day stretch if you choose -- no SD card in the world is big enough to store all of that. It also means that your footage is more secure (assuming you trust that hackers won’t make their way into Nest’s cloud servers) and not vulnerable to fire, theft or other mishaps.

It’s not a perfect solution. You still need to connect the Nest Cam to a power outlet via its 10-foot micro USB cable, which may limit where you can place it, and once placed, its angle or tilt can’t be changed remotely. If your power goes out, so does your recording because of Nest Cam’s reliance on the cloud and its lack of a battery backup.

Samsung SmartCam HD Pro ($219)

Let’s say you love everything about the Nest Cam but that Nest Aware subscription is a deal-breaker. Samsung feels your pain and is hoping to woo would-be Nest Cam buyers with its identically priced (and similar looking) SmartCam HD Pro. The camera offers an almost identical list of features to the Nest Cam, including two-way voice, low-light video, 1080p resolution, a wide field of view and real-time streaming, but it eschews cloud-based recording and alerts in favour of micro-SD-based on-board recording. Naturally this limits the sheer amount of video you can save depending on the card you buy (the camera does not come with one) but it also means a one-time cost instead of a monthly fee. You even get Samsung’s version of the Nest Cam’s Activity Zones, which lets you trace out an area of interest in the camera’s field of view. Unlike the Nest Cam, the SmartCam HD Pro comes with a series of built-in sound effects that can be triggered from your smartphone or tablet, which play back through the camera’s built in speaker -- very handy if you need to interact with your home without using your own voice: a simple siren sound might be all you need to scare away an intruder.

On the downside, cloud recording isn’t offered at all, which limits how you can use the SmartCam, and it suffers from the same limitation of placement as the Nest Cam thanks to its power cord, though just like the Nest Cam, it can be wall-mounted if you wish.

Ezviz Mini ($84.99)

Spending over $200 on a security camera might be affordable if you only need one or maybe two in your home. But what if you need a lot more, or your budget simply can’t stretch that far? Thankfully there are cheaper options like the Ezviz Mini. It can’t match the more expensive cameras feature-for-feature (it lacks face detection and alerts can only be triggered by movement, not sound) but it can easily provide you with basic functionality. You get 720p streaming and recording which won’t be as sharp as 1080p, and its lens has a narrower field of view (115 degrees), but it can handle low-light situations and it comes with a 16GB micro SD card (and supports up to 64GB). Most importantly, the Ezviz doesn’t make you choose between local storage and cloud support. You can have both and in fact, the camera comes with a free one year subscription so you can really get the feel for it. If you continue after the trial period, it’s only $5/month or $50/year.

Some reviewers have suggested that the Ezviz’s app for iOS or Android lacks polish and the learning curve may be steeper than its pricier competitors, but that might be easily overlooked considering this product is less than half the price of the other cameras.

Canary All-In-One Camera ($249)

Going to the other extreme is the Canary All-in-One Camera. It’s more expensive than many of the others, but arguably the most capable too. If you’re looking for a single device that could theoretically replace an entire home security system, the Canary comes closest. By this point, you know the drill: 1080p video with low-light capability, that streams directly to your phone or tablet. The Canary uses the cloud-only model of the Nest Cam, but gives 12 hours of recording away for free, on an ongoing basis. Subscription plans that start at $4.99/month can increase this to 30 days. Unlike the other cameras, the Canary must sit on a flat, centrally located surface because its attractive cylindrical shape doesn’t allow for wall mounting. What the Canary does have that the others do not is an ear-splitting 90 decibel alarm that can be activated remotely, and a suite of extra sensors such as an air-quality sampler, a motion detector, a humidity sensor, a temperature gauge and a 3-axis accelerometer. This might seem extreme, but if you’re trying to keep tabs on a secondary property like a cottage, they could provide critical information in the event of a fire, flood or other disaster. It also boasts the widest field of view at 143 degrees -- which means the Canary can see more, and doesn’t need to be shoved in a corner to give you a clear view of what’s going on.

The Canary is also equipped with a handy geofencing system which lets you assign multiple devices to the system’s “awareness” of who’s home, automatically arming or disarming the system depending on whether these devices are in the house or not -- perfect for smartphones that tend to go where we go, not so great for tablets that often get left at home.

Netatmo Welcome ($219)

Like a cross between the Canary and the Samsung SmartCam, Netatmo Welcome is a home security camera with another cylindrical, non-wall-mountable design, and uses micro SD cards exclusively for recording footage from its 1080p-capable, 130-degree field of view camera. It comes with an 8GB card, but you’ll need to buy more as this will fill up quickly. The Welcome’s claim to fame is that it’s the only camera on the market (currently) that does facial recognition. When you set it up (using your WiFi or wired network) you create profiles for each person in your house and then “train” the camera to recognize these people. It’s a process that takes some time, but works well in the end. The Welcome can then be set to send you alerts based on the faces it sees. Want to know when your youngest child comes home? Or perhaps you simply want to know when an unrecognized person is in your house… either way, Welcome will tell you. It can also be triggered by movement of any kind, something which reviewers have suggested creates a bit of a problem for users: the Welcome can detect even the slightest of movements and unlike the Nest Cam, it doesn’t seem to distinguish between noteworthy ones and non-relevant ones. This can mean a lot of false-alarms if you place Welcome in a high-traffic area. Of course, if you place it elsewhere, it may not see much.

The question is, as cool and unique as face detection is, is it worth $219, especially considering what the Welcome lacks: no cloud storage option, no two-way communication, no audible alarm and no way to adjust the sensitivity of its movement-based alerts?

Netgear Arlo ($199)

Of all the security cameras we’ve covered so far, all of them have one thing in common: They need to be wired to a power outlet, even if they communicate over WiFi. That creates some limitations on placement, and can mean some pretty unsightly wires. So the Netgear Arlo, despite its limited feature set, is very attractive to buyers looking for a wireless option. On the downside, you need a separate base station to connect Arlo cameras to the Internet, but it’s included at this price point. The video quality, at 720p, is poor by comparison to the 1080p that is the norm for most other cameras. It does not have a mic or built-in speakers so nevermind two-way communication -- you simply don’t get sound of any kind. As for advanced features like face detection or burglar alarms? Fuggedaboudit. With only 110 degrees of field of view, it can’t capture as much of the action as the others mentioned here.

But what the Arlo does offer is unlimited placement flexibility thanks to its use of C123A batteries instead of AC power -- these last for about 3-4 months depending on usage. It’s also completely weather-proof, which means it can be used outdoors too -- even during a cold, Canadian winter. The included magnetic wall mount is very clever: Its semi-spherical shape means you can easily adjust where the Arlo is pointed throughout a wide range of angles (though any small bump could easily move it).

Moreover, Netgear gives you 7 days of cloud video recording for free (which is good, because there’s no on-board storage) and you can add up to 15 cameras to a single base station. Additional cameras cost $179 each, though you may get a better price if you buy more than one.

There’s only one type of alert: Movement -- it’s adjustable, so this will help with false alarms, and you can create rules for each camera that dictate what they should do when they detect movement (e.g.: Nothing, record a 20-second clip, send an email alert etc.). The one thing to keep in mind with the Netgear Arlo is that, because it is battery powered, you can’t use it to record continuously 24/7. It’s designed to only record short clips when it sense movement, or stream live video for short durations to your phone or tablet. This may limit its value for people who want to constantly check-in on kids or pets.

Homeboy ($189 USD – no Canadian pricing option)

If you like the idea of the Netgear Arlo’s wire-free installation option, Homeboy’s family of WiFi security cameras can go one step better: Not only are they wire-free, with the ability to mount almost anywhere indoors, they don’t require a separate base-station because they connect directly to your WiFi router. This simplifies the setup and the amount of gear you need. Homeboy’s cameras eschew the Arlo’s disposable lithium batteries for internal, rechargeable ones that last about 90 days between charges with typical usage. Just like the Arlo, Homeboy captures video clips, which it stores in the cloud, and does not offer live streaming. The company’s free plan offers 12 hours of video storage, with unlimited downloads, but you can increase this to 30 days of storage for $4.99 US a month.

There are two major drawbacks to the Homeboy at this time: First, its camera sensor only delivers a low-res 640x480 video image with only 52 degrees of horizontal view. You’ll still see what’s going on, but you’ll have to be very strategic with where you place it, as it won’t be able to show you a whole room at once and you won’t be able to make out any fine details. Second, it isn’t weatherproof, so consider the Homeboy indoor-only.

On the plus side, the Homeboy has a built-in mic, which means its recordings include audio—something the Arlo notably lacks. Homeboy also offers an intriguing way to increase its recording smarts: It’s compatible with the web-based IFTTT service (If This Then That), which gives users the ability to create smart-home “recipes” for their connected gadgets. For example, you could simply let Homeboy send you alerts based on its built-in motion detection, or, you could trigger it to record whenever your Nest Protect thermostat smells smoke. Conversely, the Homeboy can be used to trigger your other smarthome devices, perhaps by turning on your WeMo lightbulbs when it detects motion (not only to give an intruder a scare, but also to throw some more light on what Homeboy is recording).

The company is promising to enhance its security options in 2016 by giving users the ability to have their cameras professionally monitored by a security company.

Finally…

No matter which home security camera you buy, we urge you to think carefully about security. There have been several articles published recently about the risks that web-connected camera pose to possible intrusion and the advice they offer is worth repeating here:

Make sure your home network is secured using a unique password (not the default one that comes with your router) and is based on a strong scheme like WPA2

Do not use the default password on the camera system you buy--create a new one and don’t share it

Consider the vulnerability of the video footage you are recording. The Nest Cam records only to the cloud or your phone, which means that if stolen, thieves do not get your footage. The Samsung SmartCam however, records unencrypted video to its SD card, which anyone could view if they stole it. Make sure the product you buy has sufficient protections in place for your needs

Now that Canadians have fully embraced the “glamping” or glamourous camping trend, countless businesses offering luxurious accommodations have popped up to give visitors the nature experience without the inconvenience.

One such opportunity involves cuddling up in a snug, wooden pod with modern amenities in the charming countryside of southwestern Ontario. Long Point Eco-Adventure, located in picturesque Norfolk County, approximately a two-hour drive from Toronto, offers three different types of comfortable lodging to satisfy every budget.

The cozy pods and spacious suites allow visitors to rest their weary heads in peace after an action-packed day of kayaking, mountain biking, axe-throwing, zip-lining or stargazing at the adventure resort’s observatory.

Camping pods

For anyone looking to save a buck or two and can handle a little less space, Long Point Eco-Adventure’s camping pods may be the perfect tent alternative. The adorable dome-shaped wooden pods include a queen sized bed or two twin beds and include hardwood floors, stylish bedding, a sliding glass door and a private deck.

Travellers will have to use the resort’s communal washroom and shower facilities if they opt to book this simple but charming accommodation. There is also no electricity in the camping pods, so don’t expect to charge an iPhone while residing in this rustic pod.

Cost:

$89/night for low season weekdays

$109/night for low season weekends and high season weekdays

$129/night for high season weekends

For nature-enthusiasts who appreciate space and privacy, the camping pods’ upgraded relative, the wilderness pod, may be just the thing. For a little more money, visitors will sleep on a queen-sized bed and relax in a homey living room complete with a table for dining.

The wilderness pods’ most attractive feature, perhaps, is the private flush toilet and sink; although, patrons will still have to use the shared shower facilities. On top of running water, guests will enjoy all of the same features as the camping pods along with electrical outlets for any of their charging needs.

Wilderness Suites

For the ultimate lap of camping luxury, guests can book one of the resort’s spacious wilderness suites for a true glamping experience. The tent-like structure could be considered more of a hotel room substitute than a tent alternative. With a choice of a king-sized bed or the family-friendly two queen-sized beds option, visitors will have more than enough room to spread out and relax.

The well-equipped suite includes all of the same features as the other two cheaper accommodations, but with the added bonus of a mini fridge and a private outdoor shower.

We’ve had enough. We’ve seen a lot of beautiful sights and I know there are so many more out there to see, but the key to any great adventure is knowing when to wrap it up.

Our plan had always been to travel for six months and I feel a little disappointed we’re stopping at five. But there would have been no prize for making it to the six-month mark (at least I think there wasn’t) and there’s no shame in heading home early.

We know we’ve been lucky to take this trip at all, even if it involved selling our house and putting our lives on hold.

But the problem with long-term family travel that no one tells you about is the “family” part. Also, the “long-term” part. So really the “long-term family” part; the “travel” part has been fine.

We love our children, really we do. They are smart and funny and they’re useful for carrying stuff. We’re pretty sure they love us too. But no matter how much your family means to you, it’s really, really hard to spend every minute of every day with them. You get on each other’s nerves and I’m here to confess it doesn’t get any easier as the weeks tick on.

There have been some exhausting moments with these kids. Like the time our boy threw his stuffed animal in the air while waiting for the train outside Disneyland Paris and it landed on the tracks and his daddy angrily jumped down to retrieve it only to be greeted by an even angrier French soldier with a very large gun. He yelled in words that Daddy couldn’t interpret but understood just fine.

Or the time this same boy lost his e-reader in the back seat of a Spanish taxi, then lost his sister’s e-reader hours later by “hiding” it under a suitcase where it wasn’t found until two weeks later. (The e-reader left in the taxi was retrieved as well after Mommy engaged in some high-level negotiating in some low-level Spanish.)

Or the myriad number of times our two kids descended into fisticuffs while in public -- almost invariably in a fancy restaurant with white tablecloths -- with the short, sharp battles ending in howls and tears and vows of revenge. From us parents, mostly.

Of course, there have also been plenty of spectacular moments too. Like hiking the cliffs of Ireland and the moors of England, and seeing the boiling hot geysers of Iceland. The kids have touched fish in the Mediterranean, ridden camels in Morocco and ponies in Paris, and stayed in a cave home dug into a cliff. They’ve climbed up castle walls, ridden to the top of the London Eye and seen the Eiffel Tower from down below.

And though they may not realize it, they’ve learned a ton about European history too, about medieval warfare, the Titanic disaster, the Irish famine, and the Moorish invasion of Spain. They’ve even learned a bit about European hygiene. (“Tell me again, Momma, about how the bod..., the bahdet.. the buttwasher works, please?”)

But in between all that wonder, there have been some pretty trying parenting moments and plenty of frustration. When you’re at the point of thinking the primary goal of your trip is no longer enjoyment but endurance, that’s a pretty good sign it’s time to pack it in.

I’m well aware there are lots of families who travel the world for much longer, because I met and spoke with many before we left. They talked about how travel helped mature their children, teaching them independence, and to see that there are other ways of life that are so much different from their own.

And I know there are some families who go through even bigger changes and make being global nomads a permanent way of life. I tip my hat to these families; they’re braver than we are. Maybe it’s different when you’ve committed to a full year of handling travel logistics, cranky kids, fussy eaters and homeschooling stress. Maybe they’re just better travellers than we are. Maybe they’re better parents.

Or maybe our kids might not be cut out for this. Our boy has always just gone along with whatever we have planned -- mostly because he often has no idea what’s going on at all. He usually has his nose in a book and I’m not even sure how much of this trip he’s absorbed at all, since most days he can’t even keep track of which country he’s in.

But our daughter is a quieter girl who has never really liked change. From the start, she told us she wasn’t eager to go. We knew that when we left. But isn’t our job as parents to encourage our kids to try new things, to push themselves beyond what they think they are capable of, to broaden their worlds? If we only ever keep things comfortable for them, how can they grow?

We hoped that once the kids saw a few of the great cities of Europe and landscapes they’d never seen before, they’d begin to see why we were so excited to show them this stuff.

But even after all the fun moments we’ve had, my daughter would still tell you she’d rather be home. She recently admitted she has decided she doesn’t like to travel. (Except airplane liftoffs. Those will always be fun, she says.) It kind of breaks my heart to hear that, that my daughter doesn’t love travel the way I do, especially since I’ve always sought out adventure and learning anything new.

But one of the hardest lessons one has to accept as a parent is that your kids aren’t you. They aren’t always going to love the same things you love, no matter how badly you want them to. My daughter is naturally a bit of a homebody, and this trip hasn’t changed that about her, even if I hoped it might.

So for the sake of family harmony, we’re heading home. It’s been a terrific journey and one we’re proud to say we got through without any disasters, injuries, or arrests. We’ve lost some socks and some hair along the way but we’re coming back with a ton of great photos and memories, two kids and each other, which is all we really need.",[],1057,0.8812129654325762

It seems a spoonful of sugar can do more than help the medicine go down. It can also help keep bee populations up, which is vital for humanity’s survival.

If you don’t bee-lieve me, just ask the fans of Sir David Attenborough.

A Facebook community page dedicated to the famous English naturalist and narrator of renowned nature documentaries such as, ‘The Blue Planet’ and ‘Planet Earth,’ sought to raise awareness about the plight of the bee.

“In the last 5 years the bee population has dropped by 1/3. If bees were to disappear from the face of the earth, humans would have just 4 years left to live,” the group wrote in a Facebook post earlier this month.

The fan group shared a simple tip that anyone can use at home. The post said that bees can often look like they’re dead or dying, particularly at this time of year, when in reality, they’re just tired.

“They simply don't have enough energy to return to the hive which can often result in being swept away,” the group wrote.

For anyone who comes across an exhausted bee, the Facebook group recommends mixing a simple solution of two tablespoons of white, granulated sugar with one tablespoon of water. Bees require carbohydrates from sugars in nectar or honey to convert into much-needed energy.

They also suggest placing the mixture on a spoon within reach of the tired bee. Additionally, they asked readers to share the Facebook post to increase awareness. The post has been shared more than 455,000 times as of Friday morning.

Pollinators like honey bees play a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems by pollinating flowering plants, fruits and vegetables. According to the World Wildlife Foundation, more than three-quarters of the world’s food crops are dependent on pollination.

A single bee colony can pollinate approximately 300 million flowers each day, according to Green Peace.

In Canada, pollinators are responsible for one in every three bites of food Canadians eat and $2 billion worth of crops, according to the partnership of agricultural organizations known as Bees Matter.

Although Statistics Canada says the number of honey bee colonies has actually increased 3.6 per cent from 2017 to a record high of 721,106, populations have been in decline in other parts of the world due to the destruction of natural habitats, diseases, and pesticides.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species shows that nearly 24 per cent of Europe’s bumble species are threatened with extinction. In the U.S., honey bee hives have decreased from 6 million in the 1940s to approximately 2.5 million, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Other ways to help:

In addition to feeding bees sugar, the WWF recommends planting pollinator-friendly plants such as, primrose, buddleia, and marigolds. The organization also suggests leaving an area of the garden untended to allow bees to buzz around in the long grass or make nests in compost heaps or hedgerows.

Certain pesticides and chemicals can pose a risk to pollinators, particularly when plants are in bloom. The federal government recommends limiting pesticide use and following pollinator-friendly best practices. These include avoiding crops or weeds where bees may be present and limiting “drift” exposure caused by spraying chemicals.",[],551,0.9711470347699716

Skotnicki believes that advertising from the multi-billion dollar personal hygiene industry has encouraged daily cleansing routines that have resulted in 40 per cent of people worldwide finding they have sensitive skin.

A practicing dermatologist for 20 years and the co-author of Beyond Soap, Skotnicki told CTV’s Your Morning that body washes, facial cleansers, and even water can all contribute to skin irritation and aging.

“Our skin is like a brick wall, and the mortar, or our wall, is fats or lipids,” says Skotnicki. “Soap and water, even just water, remove the mortar.”

In order to soothe sensitive skin, stave off signs of aging, or just to get a healthy glow, Skotnicki has some tips for re-thinking personal hygiene.

1. Throw out your products: The average woman applies 16 products to her face before leaving her house in the morning. Many of these products contain irritants, like fragrance and detergents, and they end up doing more harm than good. “Think about ‘less is more,” Skotnicki recommends. Her daily skincare regimen consists solely of SPF and cleansing with micellar water, a mild cleanser diluted with water.

2. Cut down on bathing: Sitting in a bath allows water to erode the skin’s natural protection. Skotnicki recommends limiting baths to under ten minutes and opting for showers whenever possible. She also recommends showering once a day at the most.

3. Focus on the ‘bits’: Getting in the shower and lathering your entire body in soap is completely unnecessary. “Washing your whole body because you think it’s healthy is damaging and it’s probably causing things like allergies and eczema,” Skotnicki says. She says to focus on cleaning parts that are actually dirty or smell, such as armpits and groin. Stick to mild, fragrance-free body washes over bar soap.

4. Skip your morning skincare regimen: Unless you’ve been out all night, Dr. Skotnicki says cleansing your skin in the morning is overkill. A splash of water is sufficient to clean your skin off, and a bit of SPF is the only anti-aging product you need.

5. Let kids be (dirty) kids: Young children are often the most dramatically affected by over-washing. Twenty-five per cent of young people suffer from eczema, a once-rare skin condition that can be caused by washing away the skin’s natural defences. Skotnicki recommends only bathing children several times a week and to avoid sitting them in baths for long periods of time.",[],414,0.9803629363950316

The tiny pests are experts at hunting for fermenting produce, and find their way into fruit-filled homes through window screens or cracks in doors.

Also known as drosophila flies and vinegar flies, the bugs can hitch rides on fruits and vegetables from the grocery store.

According to researchers at the University of Guelph, the flies have an average life span of approximately 40 to 50 days. Female flies can lay up to 500 eggs during their short life.

Kendra Mangione has rounded up some advice from experts and amateurs, including her grandmother, on what to do if you have an infestation in your home:

Entomologist's advice

""Don't leave ripe fruit on the counter. If you plan to keep fruit on the counter, wash it as soon as you bring it home,"" Royal Ontario Museum Entomologist Antonia Guidotti told CTVNews.ca.

""This may get rid of any eggs that are already present on the fruit.""

Pest control expert's solution

""Remove garbage as soon as humanly possible, especially in areas like the kitchen,"" pest control specialist Natasha Anderson said.

""If you feel unable to remove the garbage bags on a regular basis, I highly recommend putting offcuts from fresh foods (vegetables, fruits and meat) into a smaller plastic shopping bag. Once you are done preparing the meal, tie up the bag and put that inside your main garbage bin.""

Gardener's tip

""There are herbs that you can bring into your home that will repel them,"" Canada AM's gardening expert Mark Cullen said.

""Take some basil, cut it and put leaves on your bananas (or whatever fruit they're attracted to). The less popular herb tansy has insecticidal properties, and lemon, lemon verbena and citrosa geraniums also work. They don't kill the bugs but repel them.""

Home blogger's recommendation

""Keeping your kitchen clean definitely helps to keep fruit flies away,"" MrsJanuary.com blogger Ashley LeBlanc advised. ""If you do get stuck with them, I've found a red wine trap works best: a little bit of red wine in the bottom of a cup, a piece of Saran wrap over top and holes poked through with a toothpick so they can get in but not out. Works every time!""

Grandma's take

""I think they come from the drain, that's what they tell me anyway. I try to make sure all my drains are closed if I notice any in the house, to keep them from laying eggs,"" CTVNews.ca writer Kendra Mangione's always-right grandmother Ella Morton suggested.",[],408,0.9767938212769612

""There was no trading, no selling and the city streets were dead. They looked the same at 3 p.m. as they did at 3 a.m.,"" said Wayne Fournier, mayor of the town of 1,800 people in Washington state.

""We were getting a lot of calls from businesses saying they were not sure if they would be able to hang on,"" he told AFP.

The town's museum had a printing press, so it was put to use to make US$10,000 worth of bills on wooden rectangles, each nominally worth $25.

They feature a portrait of former president George Washington and bear a Latin inscription that translates as ""We've got it under control.""

The money is being given as a grant to locals who demonstrate they have been economically harmed by the pandemic. Each resident is allowed up to $300 per month.

Known as ""Tenino dollars,"" ""COVID dollars"" or, sometimes, ""Wayne dollars"" after the mayor himself, the bills are traded at almost all shops in the town at a fixed rate equivalent to $1.

The currency is good only inside the town limits.

DESPERATE TIMES

The idea is not new: town officials last tried it during an even worse period of economic devastation, the Great Depression in the 1930s.

A national scarcity of dollars at the time prompted officials in Tenino to print money on spruce bark.

""The concept became 1930s viral,"" Fournier said, with other communities, businesses and chambers of commerce eager to emulate the town's example.

Media attention piqued the curiosity of investors, and over the years the wooden currency became a collector's item sold on eBay and Amazon.

The contemporary version of wooden currency, like the previous edition, aims to help the town through an economic crisis that forced businesses to close nationwide.

""It's more of an advertisement for the town itself,"" said Chris Hamilton, the manager of the town's main grocery store. ""It brings a lot of people into town that may not even know about Tenino and want to check this place out that makes its own money.

""They might stop off here, buy an ice cream or go down the street and buy a hamburger.""

Similar complementary currencies exist elsewhere in the U.S. and Europe, aimed not at replacing the national money but supporting the local economy -- a key distinction since American authorities take a dim view of anyone trying to create a bill to compete with the almighty dollar.

The U.S. Treasury declined to comment on its position regarding local currencies.

Switzerland's WIR system, created in 1934, is considered the oldest local currency in the world, used by thousands of small businesses every day.

RESPONSE TO GLOBALIZATION

Facing an unemployment rate of 11.1 per cent in June -- one of the highest rates since the Great Depression -- American advocates of complementary currencies say now is the time to consider them as a means to help residents.

""The crisis in municipal funding is pushing creativity. Administrators are exploring this concept of issuing their own currency instead of bonds to finance their COVID response,"" said Susan Witt, director of the Schumacher Center for a New Economics.

The research centre developed BerkShares, a currency in circulation since 2006 in the Berkshires region of western Massachusetts, which is distributed by local banks. Witt is advising several U.S. municipalities interested in similar initiatives.

Advocates of local currencies also see them as a bulwark against unbridled globalization.

""People are starting to realize that we went too global, too fast and we lost our local skills,"" said Chris Hewitt, founder of Hudson Valley Current, a currency in upstate New York which operates as a mutual credit system.

Supporters hope to create a nationwide movement.

""If that happens across the country organically, that could be something that helps save us from a serious recession,"" Fournier said.",[],650,0.953443923274384

Founded in New York in 1818, Brooks Brothers survived two world wars, the Great Depression and even managed to stay afloat as dress standards eased in the office. But the pandemic pushed it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with so many stores closed and, with millions working from home, a crisp suit pushed to the very bottom of shopping lists.

Brooks Brothers will permanently close more than a quarter of its 200 stores.

The retail sector was under severe pressure even before the pandemic. Rival Barneys New York filed for bankruptcy protection late last year. Since COVID-19 began to spread in the U.S, J.Crew,Neiman Marcus,J.C. Penney and other national retail chains have followed suit.

The virus has hollowed out spending in many places and the accelerated the shift to online shopping, mostly to the benefit of big retailers like Walmart, Target and Amazon.com. Stores have begun to open in some parts of the country, but millions of people are still hunkered down at home. There are regions in the U.S. that are now getting hit with a wave of infections and some companies like Apple are shutting down stores again in those areas.

Brooks Brothers said Wednesday that it will continue operations as it restructures and is looking to reopen shops that are not being closed permanently. The company employed 4,000 people in March, before it furloughed about a third of its workers.

Jonathan Pasternak, a bankruptcy lawyer at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, said that even before the pandemic, Brooks Brothers' store expansion and the cost of making clothes in the U.S. had created a financial burden, but he does not believe the company will disappear.

“The good thing about Brooks Brothers: It's a very strong brand,” he said.

The company has a storied history, dressing at least 40 American presidents, including Abraham Lincoln, who was wearing a Brooks Brothers coat when he was assassinated in 1865. Brooks Brothers' two-button suits were a favourite of President John F. Kennedy.

But its cultural influence has been broad.

Clark Cable wore Brooks Brothers and Jennifer Aniston appeared on the cover of GQ magazine wearing nothing but a red, white and blue Brooks Brothers tie.

The Duck Brand Stuck at Prom Scholarship Contest challenged students around North America to create their best prom outfit out of duct tape.

Le Chateau, which operates 129 stores in eight provinces as well as some manufacturing operations, issued the dire warning late Monday as it reported its latest quarterly earnings report. Although the results covered a period before the pandemic, the company also noted the significant effects that being ordered to close all of its stores has had on its business.

""There are material uncertainties that cast significant doubt upon [our] ability to continue as a going concern,"" the company said in a press release accompanying its earnings report.

Those uncertainties predated the pandemic, as the company said it was already in debt and has defaulted on loans. Now, though, the Montreal-based retailer says it needs to obtain new financing to stay afloat.

Although all of Le Chateau's stores had reopened as of last week, the company warned that the pandemic ""will have a material and adverse impact"" on its business and that it does not expect to fully resume normal operations until 2022.

The company said it is in negotiations with its existing lenders and seeking new sources of financing, while also talking to its landlords about possible rent relief. It announced last week that it is manufacturing up to 500,000 hospital gowns as part of a federal contract.

Le Chateau's fourth-quarter results included a sales decline of 6.5 per cent year-over-year, to $175.9 million, despite a significant increase in online sales. The company recorded a net loss of $51.2 million, up from $6.1 million the previous year, which included a $42-million write-off and write-down of long-term assets.

Despite revealing that its entire operation may not be able to survive another year, Le Chateau has not announced plans to close any stores. This is in sharp contrast to how many other clothiers have handled pandemic-exacerbated downturns, as retailers including The Children's Place, Aldo and Reitmans have announced plans to close stores belonging to some of their brands this year. One analyst has suggested that more than 2,500 big-brand store closures could be announced in Canada this year.

If you've ever wondered what space smells like, a new perfume may answer that for you. A Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign was recently launched for a new fragrance called Eau de Space to bring the smell of outer space back down to Earth.

The fragrance was developed by Steve Pearce, according to Eau de Space product manager Matt Richmond. Pearce is a chemist and the founder of Omega Ingredients, a company focused on the ""creation of the highest quality, provenance driven, natural flavours and ingredients for the food and beverage industry,"" its website says.

Pearce was originally contracted by NASA to recreate the smell in 2008 after he worked on a scent exhibition for which he recreated the smell of the inside of the Mir Space Station, Pearce told CNN.

Using notes from astronauts who described space smelling like ozone, hot metal and fried steak, Pearce used his knowledge of flavour and fragrance chemistry to produce combinations matching those descriptions, he said.

It took Pearce a few weeks to gather the ""right aroma chemicals"" to try out a few ideas before arriving at something he found satisfactory, he said.

The scent was created to help astronauts train before launching in orbit, and it was part of NASA's goal of eliminating any potential surprises astronauts might encounter or experience in space, according to the Kickstarter.

""It's kind of like a smell from a gun, right after you fire the shot,"" Peggy Whitson, an astronaut and former resident of the International Space Station, told CNN in a 2002 interview about the smell of space. ""I think it kind of has almost a bitter kind of smell in addition to being smoky and burned.""

Richmond said that he has struggled to describe how the fragrance smells, adding, ""Astronauts describe the smell as a mix of gunpowder, seared steak, raspberries and rum.""

The company's main goal with Eau de Space is to increase interest in STEM learning for K-12 students through what Richmond called ""experiential education."" He hopes that Eau de Space will start the discussion, with parents, teachers and scientists taking it from there.

Now there are calls for changes to federal support programs to help businesses keep people employed while they continue to navigate challenges posed by the pandemic.

National industry advocate Restaurants Canada wants to see the 75 per cent federal wage subsidy remain available as long as restrictions are in place for businesses, gradually reducing as revenues increase. In May, the subsidy was extended until the end of August.

The organization is also calling on Ottawa to change the requirement for a 30 per cent revenue decline, and instead assess needs on a scale, so that increasing sales while still operating at a loss won't mean a business is cut off.

Steve Huynh and his wife Camy Wong own the restaurant chain Steve's Poke Bar, and would also like to see the changes recommended by Restaurants Canada.

Their family business shut down for four weeks early into the pandemic and has since reopened its eight locations. They rehired staff with the help of the subsidy.

""Our sales are still down but because of the wage subsidy, we're still able to give the hours to our staff that so they can support themselves,"" Huynh said. ""If the wage subsidy went away and our sales are still down, then we have to start looking at questions — Do we cut hours? Do we cut staff?""

At their newest location in New Westminster's Sapperton neighbourhood, which opened in January, they are currently offering online take-out orders and deliveries in place of dining in.

Wong said it's very difficult to operate at a reduced capacity for a prolonged period of time.

""We are definitely hoping to see something where the government can continue supporting all the different small businesses in a way that is proportionate to the situation that they're going through,"" Wong said. ""The one-size-fits-all is not going to be helpful in the long run.""

Most noteworthy were a new bonus plan aimed at getting firms to retain workers that have been idle for months, as well as tax cuts for hard-pressed firms in the tourism and hospitality sectors and a new ""Eat Out to Help Out"" discount scheme.

Treasury chief Rishi Sunak said his latest major intervention is aimed at weaning the U.K. economy off emergency measures announced when the country was put into lockdown in March, while at the same time protecting and generating as many jobs as possible during the recession.

""People need to know that although hardship lies ahead, no-one will be left without hope,"" he told socially distanced lawmakers.

So far, Britain has been spared the sharp rises in unemployment seen in the U.S., for example, because of the Job Retention Scheme, whereby the government has been paying the majority of the salaries of workers who were not fired. Some 1.1 million employers have taken advantage of the program to furlough 9.4 million people at a cost to the government of 27.4 billion pounds ($35 billion).

While confirming that it will end in October, Sunak said the government is introducing a new program that could cost a further 9.4 billion pounds if everyone who has been furloughed is given his or her job back. Under this plan, the government will pay companies a 1,000-pound bonus for each employee they take back.

""Leaving the furlough scheme open forever gives people false hope that it will always be possible to return to the jobs they had before,"" he said. ""The longer people are on furlough, the more likely it is their skills could fade, and they will find it harder to get new opportunities.""

The government hopes employers will make use of the new program as they try to get back on track during what is a historically savage recession -- in March and April alone, the U.K. economy shrank 25%. Many economists think unemployment could more than double to over 3 million this year, to levels last seen in the 1980s.

Anneliese Dodds, the economics spokesperson for the main opposition Labour Party, said Sunak should have made the Job Retention Scheme more flexible rather than scrapping it outright.

""It should have been the day when the millions of British people worried about their jobs and future prospects had a load taken off their shoulders,"" she said.

Sunak reserved extra support for tourism and hospitality, which were shut down during the lockdown. Pubs and restaurants, for example, only reopened Saturday for the first time in over three months.

Sunak said firms within those sectors will see taxes on sales of food and non-alcoholic drinks as well as on accommodation and admission to attractions slashed to 5% from 20%. This measure, Sunak said, is worth 4 billion pounds and should help companies support 2.4 million jobs.

He also announced a new dining discount plan for August that will give people a 50% discount at participating restaurants, cafes and pubs between Monday and Wednesday up to a maximum 10 pounds per person.

U.K. Hospitality, which represents the sector, said the measures provide many firms ""much-needed help to get going again in earnest.""

However, Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the umbrella Trades Union Congress, said Sunak should have given low-paid workers a pay increase rather than offering ""a dining out discount for the well-off.""

Other measures announced included 2 billion pounds to fund work placement schemes for 16-to-24-year-olds, a 3 billion-pound environmental package and the temporary elimination of a tax on house purchases below 500,000 pounds.

Make U.K., which represents companies in the manufacturing sector, praised Sunak's ""bold intent"" and singled out the training measures for the young.

""This is not the beginning of the end of this crisis, however, but perhaps the end of the beginning as far as the economy is concerned,"" Chief Executive Stephen Phipson said.",[],654,0.9288642257592921

Across Pakistan's ""mango belt"" in Punjab and Sindh provinces, farmers say a long winter and changing rain patterns have slashed production by up to half this year -- just as virus shutdowns sparked border restrictions and spiralling export costs.

""There are multiple problems that mango farmers are facing,"" said Rana Muhammad Azim, whose family has been producing the fruit in Punjab for generations.

""The situation is extremely worrisome for us. The mangoes are ready, but no exporter is willing to take the risk and place orders,"" he said, adding that he was already suffering from a 40 percent decline in the harvest.

Pakistan produced more than 1.5 million tonnes of mangoes in 2019 -- and exported a record 115,000 tonnes worth $80 million -- making it the sixth-largest exporter of the fruit in the world.

But Waheed Ahmed, head of a produce association in Pakistan, said exports have dropped around 40 percent compared to the same period last year, with just a few months left of the season.

Known in South Asia as the ""king of fruits"", the mango originated in the Indian subcontinent with two dozen varieties grown in Pakistan.

The country's most treasured variety is the greenish-yellow Chaunsa, known for its rich, unique flavour and juicy pulp.

The fruit also helps sweeten diplomatic relations, with Pakistan sending crates of its best produce to India's prime minister every year, regardless of the political climate between the hostile neighbours.

It has also earned a place in recent literary history, with renowned Pakistan author Mohammed Hanif longlisted for the prestigious Man Booker Prize for ""A Case of Exploding Mangoes"", a comic novel based on an unexplained 1988 plane crash that killed former president Muhammad Zia ul-Haq.

ROTTING FRUITS

With much of the world's air traffic grounded by the coronavirus, exports of the best prime, ripe fruit by plane to the US and Europe have been particularly hard hit, but ground transport has also been badly affected.

Dozens of trucks piled high with the yellow fruit were stranded at the border with Iran last month, their precious cargo rotting in the searing 40-degree heat.

Even where trading has continued via sea to the key Middle East market -- which accounts for 70 percent of exports -- demand has plunged.

Since the virus took hold shoppers are making fewer outings to supermarkets and are wary of spending on luxury items, while Pakistani migrant workers who relish the fruit have returned home.

The domestic market brings far less revenue.

In one bright spot, harvests were at least spared the ravages of the worst locust plague in 25 years, which wiped out entire vegetable and cotton harvests.

As flights resume and border restrictions are eased, growers hope to increase exports in the second half of the season to avoid a complete lost season.

Some say aliens have,'Jen Rose Smith',2020-07-09 08:57:00-04:00,"Erich von Däniken dried his sweaty palms with granite dust as he scaled the Great Pyramid of Giza, crawling block by block up the nearly 4,000-year-old monument.

It was 1954, when you could still climb the pyramids. Von Däniken, a 19-year-old with a Catholic education and a passion for flying saucers, was captivated. Fourteen years later, he published an influential book called ""Chariots of the Gods,"" arguing that extraterrestrials influenced ancient sites, the pyramids included.

The magnificent Giza Pyramids are among the world's most famous ancient places, part of a sprawling UNESCO World Heritage Site that brings travelers to Egypt from across the globe.

Visitors come to explore hidden burial chambers, go eye-to-eye with the mysterious Sphinx and take in the sheer scale of Egypt's grandest monuments.

Von Däniken proposed that aliens offered technological help in building them.

WHAT THE SCIENTISTS SAY ABOUT THESE FAMOUS PLACES

Mainstream archeologists disagree with Von Däniken, retorting that ancient Egyptians developed their remarkable building tradition with no help from extraterrestrials.

But while scientists are generally united in rejecting the aliens idea, sometimes known as ""ancient astronaut theory,"" Von Däniken's ideas have endured.

He went on to write 32 additional volumes, selling more than 63 million copies. Penguin Random House, his publisher, claims Von Däniken is ""arguably the most widely read and most-copied nonfiction author in the world.""

And the pyramids aren't the only UNESCO site swept up in his theories, or in those of people he's inspired.

Some speculate that the UNESCO site of Teotihuacan, where the Aztec kings once ruled near modern-day Mexico City, could have been a space port, pointing to mica and liquid mercury found among the ruins that they say are anachronistic.

For travellers, Teotihuacan is a glimpse into an ancient, mysterious empire. Researchers believe the city predates even the Aztecs, who were living there when Europeans first arrived in Mexico.

Archeologists, who have carried out painstaking excavations here for centuries, see it as the crowning achievement of a little-known -- but earthbound -- civilization.

Instead of peering up toward space, they dig into the ground. Archaeologists have spent years excavating a tunnel at Teotihuacan, which leads to chambers full of ritual offerings that some believe symbolize the underworld.

Nearly 3,000 miles away is another enigmatic UNESCO site that draws travellers, researchers and alien enthusiasts alike.

At the Nazca Lines geoglyphs in Peru, visitors take sightseeing flights to view earthen shapes that are too massive to appreciate from ground level. For decades, some have conjectured that the shapes are some sort of ancient airport.

Peruvian scientists agree that the Nazca Lines are mysterious, but believe they are linked instead to rituals and water.

In recent years, researchers have used satellite imagery to discover more than 140 additional geoglyphs, carefully poring over data to find patterns in the landscape.

""They were not drawn by aliens, that's for sure,"" expert Javier Puente told CNN.

TEACHING AN ALTERNATIVE TO ANCIENT ASTRONAUTS

Archeologist Sarah Parcak teaches a seminar on debunking archeological myths and hoaxes at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

In the class, she pushes back on theories about ancient aliens like those proposed by Von Däniken. She sees it as important work.

""The belief that aliens built the pyramids, or in fact any ancient monument, is deeply racist,"" Parcak says. It's no coincidence that alien theories focus on places home to black, brown and Indigenous people, she notes.

Not only that, Parcak thinks that aliens are a distraction from the real wonders of archaeology. ""It's not a mystery, it's a puzzle. And puzzles take time to put together,"" says Parcak.

One example of Parcak's step-by-step detective work is the city of Itjtawy in Egypt. It was missing for thousands of years, but Parcak found it by analyzing satellite images and NASA topography data.

Sometimes, piecing together archeological puzzles feels personal.

At Parcak's very first excavation, in the Egyptian Delta site of Mendes, she made a discovery that's fresh in her mind more than 20 years later.

""I found an intact pot that was kind of mashed, but we put it back together,"" she recalls. On the handle, Parcak could make out a clear fingerprint left behind in once-wet clay.

""In that moment, I could imagine the person who made it,"" she says. ""It kind of helps us to bridge the divide between past and present and create a sense of empathy.""

Parcak's work offers a personal contact with the past, but you don't need an archeology degree to connect with the ancient world.

On UNESCO-listed Easter Island, travelers can learn how ancient islanders cooked in earthen ovens and built stone-walled gardens. (Easter Island is a favorite with alien theorists, too. Archaeologists chalk up the island's remarkable stonework to Polynesian ingenuity.)

At the temple of Dendera, part of a sprawling UNESCO site in Upper Egypt, visitors follow vivid stories and myths on brilliant wall paintings. (Dendera? Also popular with alien theorists, who interpret one wall painting as proof the ancient Egyptians had electric light bulbs. Researchers say the painting is of a pillar and a lotus flower.)

WHY LEARNING ABOUT ANCIENT HUMANS MATTERS

Learning about ancient humans is fun, but Parcak says it's important, too. For travellers and researchers alike, exploring the ancient world can shed light on the present day -- and maybe the future.

In early April, Parcak was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to write a book about collapse and resilience in the ancient world. Coronavirus, she says, has lent a new urgency and relevance to the work.

""It's like everything we study is happening in real time,"" she says. Now, she hears echoes of ancient strife whenever she turns on the news. ""The headlines we're seeing, it's like they could be archeology articles.""

For Parcak, though, visiting these ancient sites can be a source of hope. Itjtawy, the ancient city Parcak discovered using satellite imagery, is an example.

It became the capital of the Egypt after a period of widespread political instability, civil war and drought. The Old Kingdom, whose rulers built some of the greatest pyramids, had fallen.

But as power structures shifted, greater economic equality emerged. And from tomb decor to storytelling, Parcak says the area she studies represents a flourishing after chaos.

""I'm not saying it's always rosy,"" she cautions. ""But the site itself is a real symbol of what can happen after great turmoil.""",[],1019,0.9835134857079831

OTTAWA -- A new poll suggests turbulence ahead for airlines seeking public support for their current COVID-19 plans.

Seventy-two per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they're not comfortable flying since a decision by some airlines to relax their own in-flight physical distancing requirements.

As of July 1, Air Canada and WestJet both ended policies blocking the sale of adjacent seats.

The measure was seen to align with a guidance document for the aviation industry issued by Transport Canada in April to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Among other things, the department had suggested passengers should be widely spaced when possible, though they did not make it mandatory.

Airlines, however, are required to make passengers and air crews wear masks.

Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said they're comfortable getting aboard with no in-flight physical distancing and a requirement to wear masks.

There's more to it to keep flights safe, WestJet said in a statement last week after critics attacked its plan.

“What makes an airplane, and the entire journey, safe is the layers of enhanced cleaning, the wearing of masks and the hospital-grade HEPA filters that remove 99.999 per cent of all airborne particles,” the airline said.

“The hygiene standards we have now are world-class and backed by industry experts.”

Critics have also previously pounced on the airlines for another move: refusing to fully refund tickets for flights cancelled due to the pandemic.

Thousands of people have beseeched Transport Minister Marc Garneau to compel airlines to issue refunds, but he has refused, arguing that mandating reimbursements from a sector that's lost more than 90 per cent of its revenue would cripple the industry.

But 72 per cent of those polled say they totally oppose his decision.

In lieu of refunds, the airlines have offered vouchers but the poll suggests that it may take a while before people will rebook previously cancelled trips: 85 per cent of those surveyed told pollsters they have no plans to travel outside the country by the end of the year.

The survey polled 1,517 people and can't be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

Pollsters were in the field between July 3 and 5, a historically popular few days for Canadians and Americans to be on the move between the two countries, given the July 1 Canada Day holiday and the U.S.'s July 4 Independence Day.

But the border remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the majority of Canadians surveyed said they feel it needs to stay that way. The current mutual closure agreement is due to expire July 21.

Of Canadians polled, 86 per cent said they totally disagreed with re-opening the border at the end of July, allowing Americans back into the country.

Americans seem more eager both to head north and to welcome Canadians south; 50 per cent agreed the border should re-open and 36 per cent disagreed.

The potential for cross-border transmission of the virus has been a key factor in the decision to keep the border closed. Currently, rates of COVID-19 infection in the U.S. continue to climb, while in Canada the curve appears to be on a downward trajectory nearly everywhere.

Still, the survey suggests Canadians don't feel they are out of the woods. Thirty-nine per cent believe the worst is yet to come, while 35 per cent believe the worst of the crisis has passed.

In the U.S., 42 per cent of those surveyed felt the darkest days are ahead, 25 per cent believe the U.S. is in the middle of the worst part now while 21 per cent think that's already passed.",[],595,0.9099439130553071

Adding a personal touch to the lawn and garden doesn't have to be complicated or break the family budget. Homeowners can transform an ordinary looking landscape with some imagination, design, and perhaps the help of a local agriculture extension service, landscape professional or private nursery.

“A garden is really never finished,” said Jonathan M. Lehrer, chairman of the Department of Urban Horticulture and Design at Farmingdale State College on Long Island, New York. “Sometimes the most difficult thing is kind of taking that plunge and deciding you're going to develop an area or start a project.”

Some ideas that gardeners can use to start taking their yards to another level:

THE STARTING POINT

An arbour, pergola, lattice - even posts with netting wrapped around them - will grab attention, especially at a yard's entrance. It also adds height where homeowners normally think only about length and width, Lehrer said.

Adding clematis, climbing roses or honeysuckle along them will provide long periods of blooms.

Arbors decorated with lights can also define garden rooms and set up views to the space beyond, inviting exploration, said Katharine Pinney, a landscape contractor and designer in Los Angeles.

“Use them to lead your visitor through the garden,” Pinney said.

THE PATHWAY TO SUCCESS

A path with mulch, gravel, brick, pavers or flagstone with edging will encourage a stroll.

Pinney said the simpler the path's route, the better. But Lehrer suggests avoiding a straight, linear pathway.

“Trying to use more curves, twists and turns, that kind of adds the illusion of a longer length than it might be, that mystery of what might be around the next corner,” he said.

Pinney said the choice of pavers should reflect the architectural style of the house. But mixing materials, such as brick and flagstones, adds visual interest.

“In short, use your imagination!” Pinney said.

Placing decorative pots loaded with flowers along the way will create a focal point and add colour.

PLACES TO REST

Benches and tables are a must for homeowners wanting to make their yards a hangout. Having limited room shouldn't be a deterrent.

Pinney said she designs numerous small gardens because the old bungalow neighbourhoods in her area have narrow but deep lots.

“Dividing that narrow space into rooms makes the garden seem larger,” she said.

Pinney and Lehrer suggest building a fire pit, a cooking area, or a place for dining or simply to enjoy morning coffee.

GET PERSONAL

Pinney suggests incorporating items that reflect the homeowner's personality. One of her clients loved wine and held tastings with friends. Pinney said she planted wine grapes for the customer and used old wine bottles from restaurants to border a path.

Old brick from another customer's 1920s bungalow was incorporated into the border of an outdoor groundcover “rug.”

“A homeowner should think about what would make the garden a reflection of their personality and interests,” Pinney said.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Lehrer added, “I've seen people that are not going to be going to the beach. “So they're creating pool areas, adding inexpensive holiday lights and lanterns and bringing music outside.”

TIMBERRR!

Landscaping timbers can create tiered walls and stairs to bridge elevation levels in the backyard while creating more planting beds in between. They're also great for creating individual planters. Timbers are available in both natural and synthetic types.

Pinney said treated lumber secured with timber screws is best for terraces, but not for vegetable gardens.

AGREE TO TREE

Depending on the climate and sun requirements, consider planting small trees along the edges.

Japanese tree lilacs and crape myrtles provide vibrant summer colour. Trees with spring blooms include redbuds, white and pink dogwoods, flowering crabapples, ornamental pears and star magnolias. To get the earliest spring blooms, consider planting forsythias.

For northern climates, Lehrer strongly suggests the cornelian cherry dogwood. It has yellow flowers in the spring and red cherry-like fruit in late summer and early fall. The leaves turn red and orange in the fall, and as the tree ages, the outer bark peels, revealing a orange-brown colour.

“It's a four-season plant that is extremely tough,” he said.

WINGED FRIENDS

A big garden bonus is a visit from a butterfly or hummingbird. Plants that produce nectar and pollen can lure them in.

The 4-H Children's Garden at Michigan State University includes a butterfly house that is open in the spring. Education co-ordinator Jessica Wright said attracting butterflies means having compatible plants for the caterpillars they begin as. These can include fennel, dill and milkweed. Other flowering plants can act as butterfly magnets.

Among the plants that attract hummingbirds are bleeding hearts, cardinal flower, impatiens and petunias. Both butterflies and hummingbirds are drawn to bee balm, butterfly bushes and zinnia. Birds and butterflies do require water, so consider adding feeders or a bird bath.

“The interaction with nature is the next level,” Wright said. “It's great to see them enjoying your garden as well.”",[],806,0.9317185020896671

In past years, the Niagara Region grower had no trouble selling to wholesalers by the thousands.

""Now we're just composting,"" VanZanten said. ""Since my kids are home every afternoon, they have to spend two hours throwing out the flowers that have bloomed out.""

Sales are down 30 per cent for the year and Easter came and went at the height of physical distancing measures. The uncertainty facing the industry as Mother's Day approaches -- ""you could liken it to Christmas for every other retailer"" -- and the critical spring planting season dawns are even more worrisome.

""If this goes till June we will most likely be at 70 per cent,"" he said of year-over-year revenue loss. ""My overdraft is maxed out at the bank. Obviously they're wondering when I'm going to start drawing that back, and I can't since I haven't sold anything.""

VanZanten is one of thousands of flower farmers across the country concerned about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for non-perishable items pushed decorative plants out of the supply chain in last month's stockpiling frenzy, while the ongoing shutdown of garden centres in jurisdictions including Ontario and New York has cut off critical points of sale, threatening to leave growers high and dry.

""This is when we sell. We're on the cusp of a critical period,"" said James Farrar, director of the Canadian Ornamental Horticulture Alliance.

Trees, bushes and bedding plants are usually planted between May 1 and June 15, he said, with customers ranging from backyard gardeners to municipalities.

In Ontario, flower producers discarded about 40 per cent of their Easter crop, according to Flowers Canada Growers.

The province has designated garden centres as a non-essential service -- a painful exclusion for the industry, since nearly two-thirds of Canadian production stems from Ontario. Neighbouring New York and Ohio have also forced garden centres to lock their doors, while Michigan and Vermont have banned retailers from selling non-essential products, including home gardening items.

""If they don't open, the damage is going to be astronomical,"" said trade group head Andi Kuyvenhoven, noting garden centres' crucial role for bedding plants in particular.

British Columbia -- the second-biggest flower and plant producer -- Alberta and Manitoba and have allowed garden centres to keep running, while Quebec deemed them essential along with nurseries as of April 15, though not in time for Easter.

Kuyvenhoven, who with his wife co-owns a $2.5-million business selling potted Chrysanthemums and indoor calla lilies -- largely to U.S. distributors -- on a pair of farms west of Toronto, says clogged supply chains south of the border remain a problem.

""U.S. customers for a time closed their distribution systems to floral and so the main grocery chains were not purchasing plants,"" he said, which was hard on growers of cut flowers such as roses and tulips.

""If a truck can take 24 skids and four skids were flowers, the flowers came off the trucks and they put more food on the truck -- which we completely understand. The only challenge is, when you're growing flowers as we do, they also have a shelf life,"" said Kuyvenhoven, who bought his business from his parents in 1990.

""Now we're now facing liquidity issues...I haven't slept in five weeks.""

Flowers Canada Growers says exports to the U.S. make up about one-third of greenhouse flower and plant sales, which hit $1.6 billion in 2018, according to Statistics Canada. Nursery sales topped $500 million.

While garden centres can continue to operate across much of the continent, growers wonder whether bouquets and flower pots will remain on the shopping list of consumers struggling to make rent amid soaring unemployment numbers and a looming recession.

Kuyvenhoven is hoping that families confined to their homes for most of the day will choose to spend what they've saved from unpurchased vacations and lattes on plants for their vases and flower beds.

""That's part of what's carried us through downturns in the past,"" he said.

Growers associations are in talks with federal and provincial governments over potential financial relief, with Flowers Canada Growers asking for a ""cash injection"" as well as extended debt repayment plans secured in part by Ottawa, Kuyvenhoven said.

So far, the federal government has extended a stay of default for eligible farmers until Oct. 31, giving flower and potted plant producers an extra six months to pay off federal loans that would have been due at the end of April.

Ottawa has also granted exemptions on air travel restrictions to temporary foreign works and invested $50 million to help farmers fly in labourers on charter trips. ""New flights are being booked ever day,"" the agriculture department said in an email.

Back at the greenhouse, VanZanten mulls the overripe lilies and orchids.

""Flowers do make you happier, they do actually lift your spirits...but there are farms that can't bounce back from this,""

he said.

""This all happened at the wrong time.""

The doors of Golden Acre Home and Garden in Calgary are allowed to be open as an essential service in Alberta, but there are ample warnings about social distancing.

A steady stream of customers, many of them wearing face masks, walk through the store even though spring bedding plants aren't ready and the selection of seeds and flowers is somewhat limited.

Zannis said having an online presence puts his greenhouse on less shaky ground than many others.

The business has sent products to as far away as Nunavut and Nova Scotia in recent years but will be focusing primarily on the Calgary market now.

Online orders are up by 2,000 per cent from a year ago, Zannis said. But it's not a gold mine.

""It's very expensive to operate. Now you have to pay somebody to go and do the shopping,"" he said.

""But the online store has kind of kept us afloat ... We're just trying to survive, honestly. I just want to survive this year.""

In addition to Alberta, Manitoba, British Columbia and Quebec have designated garden centres as an essential service. Other provinces, including Ontario, have forced them to keep their doors closed.

""We are allowed to offer pickup at the curb, so we are doing that,"" said Mary Reid, owner of Green Thumb Gardening Centre in Nepean, Ont.

""A customer would either phone or email us what their order is, then we'd get it ready and say you can come and get it.""

Reid said she has basically had to start online orders from scratch but isn't able to do e-commerce.

She hopes gardeners will still be keen to shop when restrictions are eased.

""It's not a pretty picture at all ... it depends on how far into lockdown we get.""

The executive director of the Canadian Garden Council, the national umbrella body for provincial and national garden organizations, said there's been a huge increase in the number of Canadians who want to start gardening.

Michel Gauthier said it's a struggle for centres that have to stay closed.

""A lot of growers and greenhouses are having issues. Right now, there's a big movement to say horticultural products are essential and should be essential for the well-being of people,"" he said.

""We're saying ... if we want people to have that gardening experience and spend some time in their garden, then they need to have access to the material and access the product.""

Don Vanderwerf said it's almost like business as usual at his Kel-Lake Greenhouses in Kelowna, B.C.

Demand for seeds, soil and vegetables has been strong, he said.

Peak gardening season begins in three weeks to a month. Vanderwerf said products will be spread out on benches and into the parking lot at his site.

Still, Vanderwerf is expecting a financial hit. He's already losing business in flower baskets for hotels and restaurants.

""We'll be down a bit. But I feel fortunate that I'm not owning a restaurant or a pub, because they're hurting.""

Plant. Breathe.

As spring's arrival in the Northern Hemisphere coincides with government stay-at-home orders, the itch to get outside has turned backyard gardens into a getaway for the mind in chaotic times.

Gardeners who already know that working with soil is a way to connect with nature say it helps take away their worries, at least temporarily.

""I love to see things grow,"" Lindsay Waldrop said. ""It's incredibly therapeutic.""

Now more than ever.

Waldrop, a resident of Anaheim, California, has an anxiety disorder. Exercise is supposed to help, but her new job as a college biology professor had prevented her from getting into a routine.

Her grandfather, who introduced her to gardening by showing her how to plant seeds, died about a year ago.

Add the global coronavirus pandemic to all that, and it's easy to see where her focus is these days.

""Sometimes I just like to sit and dig holes in the quiet with my own thoughts,"" she said. ""Outside, it takes my mind off. It gives something for my hands to do. It gives you a separate problem to think about than whatever else is going on. It gets you off of social media.""

Waldrop and her husband moved last summer from New Mexico, where she didn't have much luck gardening in a scorching climate. At her new home, she got rid of the lawn, installed an irrigation system, and recently planted dozens of tomatoes, eggplant, peppers and other vegetables.

Over the years, Waldrop converted her skeptical husband, who initially wondered why digging in the dirt and moving things around was considered fun.

After tasting his first home-grown tomatoes, he was converted.

Families, too, are discovering that gardening gives cooped-up kids something to do, builds their self-esteem and brings variety to what has suddenly become a lot of time spent together.

In Miami, Annika Bolanos isn't a fan of the south Florida heat and mosquitoes. But going outdoors lately has been a lifeline.

Bolanos works at home making cakes and doing bookkeeping with her husband's golf cart business. Her three young children add an extra layer of busy, and together they've seeded a variety of vegetables and herbs.

""We have always loved the idea of growing our own food,"" Bolanos said. ""It feels good to eat something that you grew yourself too. It also helps my kids eat more fruits and veggies since they find it cool to eat what they have grown.""

Her children water the plants daily and concentrate on what's growing.

""You're feeling the sun and the breeze and don't have to worry about anything in the moment,"" Bolanos said.

In Britain and Germany, there's a premium on allotments -- popular parcels of land rented for growing food crops.

""Those with a garden are the lucky ones,"" said Heidi Schaletzky, standing on the lawn beneath a cherry tree in the north of Berlin.

Schaletzky and her husband have been cultivating a plot in the ""Free Country"" community garden for the past eight years, growing strawberries, salad greens and kohlrabi. So far, access to garden plots remains exempt from restrictions intended to stop the spread of the virus in Germany.

""We'll be able to see other people, too,"" she said. ""As long as they stay on their side of the fence.""

As the weather warms, garden shops are bustling as other businesses shut during the outbreak.

At the Almaden Valley Nursery in San Jose, California, rose expert John Harp has seen a mix of new gardeners and regulars. Customers can't come into the shop, so their online orders are brought to their vehicles in the parking lot.

""Around town everyone is gardening right now,"" Harp said. ""They're looking to be a little bit more self-sufficient.""

This home-grown attitude goes back to World War II, when millions of people cultivated victory gardens to protect against potential food shortages while boosting patriotism and morale.

Hollie Niblett, who lives near Kansas City, Kansas, hopes the victory gardens come back. Niblett, who has a degree in horticultural therapy, tends to a kitchen garden near her backdoor, perennial flowers, flowering trees and shrubs, and upper and lower grassy yards connected by a path through an area left in its natural condition.

""There are so many things about it that feed my soul,"" she said. ""Right now, more than anything, my garden gives me hope, gives me purpose and provides a sense of connection to something bigger than myself.""

For beginners, wonderment awaits. Just south of Atlanta, 10-year-old Ezra Gandy's love for playing baseball has been paused. He and his grandmother, Melanie Nunnally, recently started an outdoor garden, planting strawberries, cabbage, broccoli, kale and asparagus.

""I like digging in the dirt because I like to see all the bugs and stuff that's in the ground,"" he said.

The non-profit group KidsGardening.org suggests that children grow their own salads or do other activities.

The virus scare could even usher in a new crop of gardeners who start from seed rather than risk the crowds buying starter plants.

Kendra Schilling of Scott Depot, West Virginia, doesn't have space for a sprawling garden, so she's planting potatoes in a bucket and trying to figure out with her teenage daughter what to do with other vegetable seeds.

""I usually go buy the plants and stick them in the dirt. But this year we're going to try to do the seeds,"" she says. ""Thank God for YouTube.""

During the summer months of 2015 to 2016, authors captured bumblebees on more than 100 plant species across more than 400 plots in the Plumas National Forest in California -- a mountainous, meadowy area with wildlife habitats near running water, where bumblebees are abundant.

The findings, published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Entomology, revealed that the most popular plant species among the bees were Oregon checker-mallow and mountain pennyroyal flowers.

Many plants rely on bees as natural pollinators to produce some of nature's most nutritious foods. However, species of North American bumblebees have significantly declined in population in recent decades. Between April 2015 and April 2016, beekeepers in the US lost 44 per cent of their colonies.

Jerry Cole, lead author of the research and biologist at the Institute for Bird Populations in California, said there are a few potential reasons behind the declines: competition with other insect species, transfer of parasites from honey bees to bumble bees, loss of floral resources, or a mismatch between the phenology of plant species and the phenology of bumblebee species.

Phenology is defined by how plants and animals function in their environments in different seasons. Making sure the two are in sync is important, as our food supply depends on the timing of phenological events.

""Determining bumblebee species' plant selection is important for retaining and promoting high quality plant resources that will help populations persist,"" the authors said.

The plants bumblebees prefer

The authors assessed the five most abundant bumblebee species' plant selection by comparing the plants they used to what was available. Although they captured bees on more than 100 plant species, just 14 of them were chosen the most.

Each bumblebee species selected a different group of flowers, even though the bees were foraging across the same plots.

""It's important to consider the availability of plants when determining what's selected for by bees,"" Cole said. ""Often studies will use the proportion of captures on a plant species alone to determine which plants are most important to bees.""

""Without comparison to how available those plants are, you might think a plant is preferentially selected by bees, when it is simply very abundant.""

The selections by the five species remained constant over the study period, suggesting that maintaining, seeding or planting with those plant species could benefit the health of the bees, the authors said.

The most abundant species of bumblebees found was Bombus vosnesenskii, or, the yellow-faced bumblebee. And the plant species used most by that species was large-leaved lupine.

A. urticifolia, a flowering plant in the mint family, was the plant most strongly selected by three of five bumblebee species surveyed. Other commonly selected flowers included thickstem asters and Ryderberg's penstemon, a flower in the snapdragon family.

Yellow-faced bumblebees tend to stay consistent with their preference even when other plants become more available in different seasons.

Bumblebees don't necessarily have natural preferences, but will decide based on the quantity or quality of the nectar or pollen available, and how easily they can be accessed. Other factors driving bumblebee flower use include the length of their tongue, flower symmetry and color preference.

Though the researchers found certain plant species were more popular among bumblebees than others, they say their results ""should be interpreted with caution because they didn't record whether plants were being used as pollen sources versus nectar sources.""

There are other factors important to maintaining the health of bees, including the presence of other pollen sources and weather variations.

Bees and marijuana

A different group of researchers from New York recently found that cannabis crops are also proving beneficial to declining bee populations -- specifically, large numbers of 16 different species of bees thriving among recently-planted cannabis plants.

Marijuana crops are helpful to bee populations in that they don't require one of the main farming practices that is a threat to bees today: insecticides.

""As an exclusively wind-pollinated crop, hemp lacks nectar but produces an abundance of pollen during a period of floral dearth in agricultural landscapes,"" said the report published in the Oxford University Press.

Because of its unique flowering phenology, hemp can potentially provide nutrition to bees during a period of floral scarcity. In a time when cannabis is a rapidly expanding crop in the U.S. agricultural landscape, ""growers, land managers and policy makers should consider its value in supporting bee communities and take its attractiveness to bees into account"" when developing pest management strategies with the health of bees in mind, the report said.

Your backyard

The small group of preferred plant species the authors identified in the new study provide a helpful start for conservationists wanting to seed and restore habitats for bees in regions similar to the study's.

In that California region, plant blooming peaked during the summer each year, but Cole said that when planting, it's important to stagger the species you grow and plant a variety so that bees can have well-rounded food resources throughout the year.

""It wouldn't hurt to plant some of the species we identify here in your home garden,"" Cole said. ""But the way that these plants are beneficial are not just on their own. You have to have a nice complement of plants that provide food resources throughout the season and not just at one point in the season.""

Use of different plants by bees can also change between years if there are changes in what's available and when the plants are blooming.

""Maintaining, seeding or planting these 'bumblebee plants' while managing the surrounding landscape"" to support a ""diverse floral community is likely to benefit bumble bees, especially if some combination of favored plant species are blooming across the duration of bumble bee activity at a given location,"" the authors said.",[],949,0.9506415144515861

Try a succulent.

Any plant with fleshy stems or leaves is called a succulent. Aside from cacti, only a few other plant families have succulent members. All these succulents, cactus or not, are low-maintenance.

SOME NON-CACTUS SUCCULENTS

One family of non-cactus succulents is Crassulaceae, which counts among its members the familiar jade plant, which has thick stems and shiny green, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. After years of selective stem cutting, my jade plant has developed two thick trunks that give it the appearance of a venerable tree in miniature.

Kalanchoe is another family member, notable for the small plantlets that grow along the edges of its leaves and periodically drop off to give rise to new plants. Hence its other name: mother-of-thousands. Shortening daylight hours in fall coax out this plant's salmon-red or apricot-orange flowers, which contrast nicely with the bluish cast of the green leaves.

Sedums are yet another Crassulaceae. My burro's tail (Sedum morganianum) has braids of thick, fleshy leaves that hide its stems as they cascade over the edges of its hanging, coconut planter.

Moving on to another family of succulents brings us to the Euphorbiaceae. Milk-striped euphorbia is named for the milky line down its stem, but I think the Latin name, Euphorbia pseudocactus, is more descriptive. With thorns and upright stems off which branch ""arms,"" the plant could easily be mistaken for a cactus.

Crown-of-thorns, aside from its beautiful pink flowers, is another Euphorbia species, this one armed with spines as fierce as those of any cactus.

Not all Euphorbiaceae are succulent; poinsettia is one that's not.

The lily family, Liliaceae, is a third plant family with many succulent members. Aloe is most famous as an ingredient of hand lotions and shampoos, but the plant itself is attractive and care-free -- mine has gone whole winters without watering! Over time, it has filled its pot with whorls of thick, fleshy, lance-shaped leaves.

Sansevieria is a succulent lily with an unflattering common name: mother-in-law's tongue. Unflattering to mothers-in-law, that is, because the plant is a cluster of long, sharp leaves speckled like snakeskin.

WATERING: LESS IS MORE

An advantage and a disadvantage of succulents as houseplants is their adaptation to survive without water. If you remember to water your plants only when you're driving in your car, or if you want a living plant that needs water only slightly more often than a plastic plant, then grow succulents.

On the other hand, if you tip a glass of water on your plants every time you walk past them, you'll soon transform any succulent houseplant into a mass of brown rot. The key to caring for succulents is to hardly ever water them. Once every couple of months in winter, and a couple of times a month in summer, is sufficient. More generally, let the soil dry out between waterings.

When repotting is needed for any succulent plant, use a potting soil that drains water quickly, made so by adding equal volumes of sand or perlite to any mix used for other types of plants.

Besides their ease of care, succulents are easy to propagate. Use the leaves, stems or offshoots, letting any of these plant parts dry and heal for a few day before potting them up. Leaves that occasionally drop off my jade plant often take root just sitting on the soil.",[],549,0.9518829376226309

Those friendly scenes now seem like a distant memory.

Hostile rhetoric has ratcheted up in recent days over Beijing's new national security law for Hong Kong. Britain's decision to offer refuge to millions in the former colony was met with a stern telling-off by China. And Chinese officials have threatened ""consequences"" if Britain treats it as a ""hostile country"" and decides to cut Chinese technology giant Huawei out of its critical telecoms infrastructure amid growing unease over security risks.

All that is pointing to a much tougher stance against China, with a growing number in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party taking a long, hard look at Britain's Chinese ties. Many are saying Britain has been far too complacent and naive in thinking it could reap economic benefits from the relationship without political consequences.

""It's not about wanting to cut ties with China. It's that China is itself becoming a very unreliable and rather dangerous partner,"" said lawmaker and former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith. He cited Beijing's ""trashing"" of the Sino-British Joint Declaration -- the treaty supposed to guarantee Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy when it reverted from British to Chinese rule -- and aggressive posturing in the South China Sea as areas of concern.

""This is not a country that is in any way managing itself to be a good and decent partner in anything at the moment. That's why we need to review our relationship with them,"" he added. ""Those who think this is a case of separating trade from government ΓÇª you can't do that, that's naive.""

Duncan Smith has lobbied other Tory lawmakers to cut Huawei out from Britain's superfast 5G network. Not only that: He says all existing Huawei technology in the U.K. telecoms infrastructure also needs to be eliminated as soon as possible.

The company has been at the centre of tensions between China and Britain, as U.K. officials review how the latest U.S. sanctions -- imposed over allegations of cyber spying and aimed at cutting off Huawei's access to advanced microchips made with American technology -- will affect British telecom networks.

Johnson decided in January that Huawei can be deployed in future 5G networks as long as its share of the market is limited, but officials have since hinted that that decision could be reversed in light of the U.S. sanctions. A new policy is expected within weeks.

Huawei says it is merely caught in the middle of a U.S.-China battle over trade and technology. It has consistently denied allegations it could carry out cyber espionage or electronic sabotage at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party.

""We've definitely been pushed into the geopolitical competition,"" Vice-President Victor Zhang said Wednesday. U.S. accusations about security risks are all politically motivated, he said.

Nigel Inkster, senior adviser to the International Institute for Strategic Studies and former director of operations and intelligence at Britain's MI6 intelligence service, said the issue with Huawei was not so much about immediate security threats. Rather, he said, the deeper worry lies in the geopolitical implications of China becoming the world's dominant player in 5G technology.

""It's less about cyber espionage than generally conceived because, after all, that's happening in any place,"" he said. ""This was never something of which the U.K. was lacking awareness.""

Still, Inkster said he's been cautioning for years that Britain needed a more coherent strategy toward China that balances the economic and security factors.

""There was a high degree of complacency"" back in the 2000s, he said. ""There was always less to the `golden era' than met the eye.""

Britain rolled out the red carpet for Xi's state visit in 2015, with golden carriages and a lavish banquet at Buckingham Palace with Queen Elizabeth II. A cyber security co-operation deal was struck, along with billions in trade and investment projects -- including Chinese state investment in a British nuclear power station. Cameron spoke about his ambitions for Britain to become China's ""best partner in the West.""

Enthusiasm has cooled significantly since. The English city of Sheffield, which was promised a billion-pound deal with a Chinese manufacturing firm in 2016, said the investment never materialized. Critics have called it a vanity project and a ""candy floss deal.""

Economic and political grumbles about China erupted into sharp rebukes earlier this month when Beijing imposed sweeping new national security laws on Hong Kong. Johnson's government accused China of a serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and announced it would open a special route to citizenship for up to 3 million eligible Hong Kong residents.

That amounts to ""gross interference,"" Chinese Ambassador Liu Xiaoming said. Liu also warned that a decision to get rid of Huawei could drive away other Chinese investment in the U.K., and derided Britain for succumbing to U.S. pressure over the company.

Rana Mitter, an Oxford history professor specializing in China, said that the security law -- combined with broader resentment about Chinese officials' handling of information about the coronavirus -- helped set the stage for a perfect storm of wariness among Britain's politicians and the public.

Mitter added that Britain has careened from ""uncritically accepting everything about China"" to a confrontational approach partly because of a lack of understanding about how China operates.

Some have cautioned against escalating tensions. Philip Hammond, the former British Treasury chief, warned that weakening links with the world's second-largest economy was particularly unwise at a time when Britain is severing trade ties with Europe and seeking partners elsewhere. Hammond also said he was concerned about an ""alarming"" rise of anti-Chinese sentiment within his Conservative Party.

Duncan Smith rejected that, saying concerns about China's rise are cross-party and multinational. He is part of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a newly launched group of lawmakers from more than a dozen countries -- from the U.S. to Australia to Japan -- that want a co-ordinated international response to the Chinese challenge.

""We need to recognize that this isn't something one country can deal with,"" he said.

As Canadian COVID-19 trends continue to decline, cases in the United States propel upwards. The Canada-U.S. border remains closed until July 21 but reopening it to non-essential travel anytime soon would likely lead to a resurgence in cases, infectious disease specialist Dr. Abdu Sharkawy said.

""It absolutely terrifies me to think of the prospect of any sort of easing of restrictions that could allow greater travel between Canada and the United States,"" he said, adding that the United States could hit 100,000 new infections per day sometime in the next week.

""These numbers are just unfathomable and astronomical when you consider what we have dealt with here in Canada over the course of three or four months.""

He said that maps tracking COVID-19 infections worldwide, like the one pictured above from Johns Hopkins University, paints a picture of how a country can successfully or unsuccessfully manage a pandemic.

While the data on the map above is on a more localized level in the United States, which makes it appear more red, there are still an overwhemling number of cases south of the border compared to Canada.

For example, a single red dot in New York City or Los Angeles accounts for more cases than in all of Canada.

""I don't think we have seen any another part of the world where you have two neighbouring countries in polar opposite situations in terms of pandemic control,"" Sharkawy said. ""This is a very strange phenomena where you are seeing such an extreme range.""

To date, there have been 2,796 COVID-19 cases per million people in Canada, while in the United States that number is much higher at 9,051 per million.

The United States is leading the world in COVID-19 cases as it nears the three million mark, while Canada has just over 106,000.

""I think if you look around the world at other countries that have successfully flattened the curve, a lot of resurgent cases have been a direct result of travel restrictions being eased,"" Sharkawy said.

""Border control and travel restrictions are a very key element in keeping your particular geographical area safe.""

""It's the longest undefended border in the world and the last thing we want to do is turn it into the longest unprotected border when it comes to COVID-19 transmission.""

Please keep the border closed...

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in June that he believes reopening the borders too early could spark a second wave of COVID-19.

""I know it's inevitable … I just don't think we are ready right now,"" Ford said. ""You see what's happening down in the states; you look at Florida, you look at Texas, Arizona, California. I don't want to be those states. I want to protect the people here in Ontario.""

""Believe me, I love the Americans, make no mistake about it, but not when their COVID cases are just spiking right now and I’m just not in favour.""

Since March, everyone entering Canada for non-essential reasons has been ordered to quarantine for two weeks. The order was extended until the end of August but could be pushed even further.

Travelling within Canada 'reasonable'

While Sharkawy said he wouldn't road trip across Canada right now, he said beginning to plan travel again within the country ""makes sense.""

""I think it's very reasonable to explore interprovincial travel,"" Sharkawy said.

""Again, I wouldn't do it for the sake of doing it but if someone wanted to visit friends or family and its likely to bring them a great deal of comfort and satisfaction then I think the benefit of that outweighs the theoretical risk of acquiring COVID-19.""",[],641,0.8706341534851146

State television South African Broadcasting Corporation has reported that Mandela died at a Johannesburg hospital early Monday morning. The cause of her death has not been announced.

She had been South Africa's ambassador to Denmark since 2015.

The Mandelas' daughter came to international prominence in 1985, when the white minority government offered to release Nelson Mandela from prison if he denounced violence perpetrated by his movement, the Africa National Congress, against apartheid, the brutal system of racial discrimination enforced in South Africa at that time.

Zindzi Mandela read his letter rejecting the offer at a packed public meeting that was broadcast around the world.

Last year Mandela stirred controversy by calling for the return of the white-owned land to South Africa's dispossessed Black majority.

""Dear Apartheid Apologists, your time is over. You will not rule again. We do not fear you. Finally .TheLandIsOurs,"" she tweeted in June last year.

South Africa's foreign affairs minister Naledi Pandor has expressed shock at Mandela's death, describing her as a heroine.

""Zindzi will not only be remembered as a daughter of our struggle heroes, Tata Nelson and Mama Winnie Mandela, but as a struggle heroine in her own right. She served South Africa well,"" said Pandor.

The Trump administration immediately appealed to a higher court, asking that the executions move forward.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan said there are still legal issues to resolve and that ""the public is not served by short-circuiting legitimate judicial process."" The executions, pushed by the administration, would be the first carried out at the federal level since 2003.

Chutkan said the inmates have presented evidence showing that the government's plan to use only pentobarbital to carry out the executions ""poses an unconstitutionally significant risk of serious pain.""

Chutkan said the inmates produced evidence that, in other executions, prisoners who were given pentobarbital suffered ""flash pulmonary edema,"" which she said interferes with breathing and produces sensations of drowning and strangulation.

The inmates have identified alternatives, including the use of an opioid or anti-anxiety drug at the start of the procedure or a different method altogether, a firing squad, Chutkan said.

The Justice Department appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

And the Bureau of Prisons continued with preparations in order to move forward should the stay be lifted. Lee has had access to social visitors, has visited with his spiritual adviser and has been allowed to receive mail, prison officials said. He's been under constant staff supervision. The witnesses for Lee are expected to include three family members, his lawyers and spiritual adviser.

The new hold came a day after a federal appeals court lifted a hold on the execution of Daniel Lewis Lee, of Yukon, Oklahoma, which was scheduled for 4 p.m. EDT on Monday at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. He was convicted in Arkansas of the 1996 killings of gun dealer William Mueller, his wife, Nancy, and her 8-year-old daughter, Sarah Powell.

""The government has been trying to plow forward with these executions despite many unanswered questions about the legality of its new execution protocol,"" said Shawn Nolan, one of the attorneys for the men facing federal execution.

The Lee execution was to be carried out after a federal appeals court lifted an injunction on Sunday that had been put in place last week after some members of the victims' family argued they would be put at high risk for the coronavirus if they had to travel to attend. The family on Monday appealed to the Supreme Court.

The decision to move forward with the execution -- and two others scheduled later in the week -- during a global health pandemic that has killed more than 135,000 people in the United States and is ravaging prisons nationwide, drew scrutiny from civil rights groups as well as family of Lee's victims.

Critics argue that the government is creating an unnecessary and manufactured urgency for political gain. The developments are also likely to add a new front to the national conversation about criminal justice reform in the lead-up to the 2020 elections.

Anti-death penalty protesters began gathering in Terre Haute on Monday. Organizer Abraham Bonowitz drove a van through the city with a sign emblazoned on the side of a trailer that read, """"Stop executions now!""

Because of coronavirus concerns, Bonowitz said his group, Death Penalty Action, wasn't encouraging others to show up. No more than a few dozen protesters were expected to join him, and they were all being told to wear masks, he said.

""It's symbolic,"" Bonowitz said about the protests. ""We are just here to say that this is wrong.""

In an interview with The Associated Press last week, Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department has a duty to carry out the sentences imposed by the courts, including the death penalty, and to bring a sense of closure to the victims and those in the communities where the killings happened.

But relatives of those killed by Lee strongly oppose that idea. They wanted to be present to counter any contention that it was being done on their behalf.

""For us it is a matter of being there and saying, `This is not being done in our name; we do not want this,""' said relative Monica Veillette.

The relatives would be travelling thousands of miles and witnessing the execution in a small room where the social distancing recommended to prevent the virus' spread is virtually impossible. An attorney for the family members who have objected to the execution said they hadn't travelled to Indiana, as of Monday morning.

The federal prison system has struggled in recent months to contain the exploding number of coronavirus cases behind bars. There are currently four confirmed coronavirus cases among inmates at the Terre Haute prison, according to federal statistics, and one inmate there has died.

Barr said he believes the Bureau of Prisons could ""carry out these executions without being at risk."" The agency has put a number of additional measures in place, including temperature checks and requiring witnesses to wear masks.

But on Sunday, the Justice Department disclosed that a staff member involved in preparing for the execution had tested positive for the coronavirus, but said he had not been in the execution chamber and had not come into contact with anyone on the specialized team sent to handle the execution.

The three men scheduled to be executed this week had been scheduled to be put to death when Barr announced the federal government would resume executions last year, ending an informal moratorium on federal capital punishment as the issue receded from the public domain. A fourth man is scheduled to be put to death in August.

Executions on the federal level have been rare and the government has put to death only three defendants since restoring the federal death penalty in 1988 -- most recently in 2003, when Louis Jones was executed for the 1995 kidnapping, rape and murder of a young female soldier.

In 2014, following a botched state execution in Oklahoma, President Barack Obama directed the Justice Departmen t to conduct a broad review of capital punishment and issues surrounding lethal injection drugs.

The attorney general said last July that the Obama-era review had been completed, clearing the way for executions to resume.

The Health Department of Northwest Michigan said other health officials in the state reported that several people have tested positive ""after attending the festivities at the Torch Lake sandbar over the Fourth of July holiday,"" the department said Friday.

Those who tested positive weren't able to identify everyone they had contact with, ""and therefore we want to make the public aware that those who attended could be at risk for exposure, and additional cases could be seen in the coming days,"" the health department said.

The disease can be mild to severe, and some infected carriers have no symptoms at all when they infect others.

Those who do get symptoms typically get sick two to 14 days after exposure to the virus, and symptoms can include shortness of breath, fever, cough, the loss of taste and smell, and diarrhea.

""Anyone that is self-monitoring as a result of a potential exposure to COVID-19 should keep away from others as much as possible and limit travel,"" the health department said.

The close race followed a bitter campaign between Duda and Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski that was dominated by cultural issues. The government, state media and the influential Roman Catholic Church all mobilized in support of Duda and sought to stoke anti-Semitism, homophobia and xenophobia in order to shore up conservative support.

Duda celebrated what was seen as a mandate for him and the right-wing ruling party that backs him, Law and Justice, to continue on a path that has reduced poverty but raised concerns that democracy is under threat.

“It was a very sharp campaign, probably too sharp at times,” Duda told supporters in Odrzywol, a town near Warsaw. “If anyone is offended by my words, please forgive me. And give me the chance to improve in the next five years.”

Duda received 51.03% of Sunday's vote, while Trzaskowski got 48.97%, according to final results Monday from the state electoral commission.

Duda told supporters in Odrzywol that he was grateful and moved by winning the support of more than 10 million voters. He said that with the race now over, it was time to turn to the difficult job of returning the country to strong growth after the economic blow of the coronavirus.

Trzaskowski conceded defeat and congratulated Duda. He thanked his supporters and said his strong showing would be the catalyst to fight to keep Poland from becoming a one-party state.

“This is just the beginning of the road,” Trzaskowski said.

But Adam Michnik, a prominent anti-communist dissident and the founding editor of the liberal Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, said the result bodes badly for Poland's young democracy.

“Andrzej Duda's victory will be understood by his voters, and first of all by those in power, as a permission for the kind of politics that Law and Justice has been pursuing for almost five years, and that is a policy of the destruction of the democratic system, of isolating Poland in Europe, of homophobia, of xenophobia, nationalism and of using the Catholic Church as a tool,” Michnik said.

“I would not even rule out a situation in which, if this policy is continued and we see an attempt on the free media, culture and science, there could be another `Maidan,”' he said, referring to the bloody 2014 pro-Europe protests in Ukraine.

Critics and human rights groups worry Duda's victory will boost illiberal tendencies at home and in the European Union, which has also struggled to halt an erosion of rule of law in Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

Among those who welcomed Duda's victory were Orban, as well as the Czech leaders.

Orban congratulated him on Facebook, saying “bravo!” while Czech President Milos Zeman though a spokesman said: “Long live Poland!”

The result was dispiriting for liberals in Europe who are keen to halt what they consider the threat of populism and nationalism.

Remigijus Simasius, the liberal mayor of the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, offered his condolences to Poles and said the small difference in support of about 2% “sometimes determines the path between progress and regress.”

Duda got help from U.S. President Donald Trump, who invited him to the White House in late June and said he was “doing a terrific job.”

His campaign focused on defending traditional family values in the predominantly Catholic nation of 38 million people, and on preserving social spending policies.

The party's popular policies included lowering the retirement age and paying monthly cash bonuses of 500 zlotys ($125) per child to all families irrespective of income.

Many credit Law and Justice for being the first party to reduce the economic inequality that came with Poland's transition from communism to a market economy three decades ago. There is a strong sense among Poles that the economic help is restoring a sense of dignity after decades of hardship from war, communism and the upheaval brought by capitalism.

The party also stoked conflict with the EU by taking control of the top courts and judicial bodies. Officials in Brussels repeatedly expressed concern over the rule of law in both Poland and Hungary, which were for many years hailed as the most successful democracies to emerge from behind the Iron Curtain.

Law and Justice officials have said they plan to continue reshaping the justice system and also want to nationalize foreign-owned private media outlets. Critics fear that lower courts will face increased political pressure and that press freedom will face new threats.

Zselyke Csaky, an expert on central Europe with the human rights group Freedom House, said Duda's victory gives the party “essentially free rein” until parliamentary elections in 2023 “to do away with limits on its power and work towards destroying Poland's independent institutions.”

Sunday's vote was originally planned for May but was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. Turnout was 68.18%, close to a record set in 1995, in a sign of the huge stakes for Poles.

As the race tightened, Duda turned further to the right in search of votes. He denounced the LGBT rights movement as an “ideology” worse than communism.

His campaign also cast Trzaskowski as someone who would sell out Polish interests to Jewish interests, tapping old anti-Semitic tropes in a country that was home to Europe's largest Jewish community before it was decimated by Germany in the Holocaust.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the election, said that while well organized, “negative campaigning and mutual vilification abounded” and that “the incumbent's campaign and coverage by the public broadcaster were marked by homophobic, xenophobic and anti-Semitic rhetoric.”

But the World Jewish Congress focused on Duda's past condemnations of anti-Semitism in a congratulatory statement, not mentioning the harsh campaign.

“President Duda has spoken out against this hatred, and we remain hopeful that he will continue to do so,” WJC President Ronald Lauder said.

During the campaign, Duda also lashed out at a German correspondent and a partly German-owned tabloid for their campaign coverage, alleging “a German attack in these elections.” A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday that Berlin works “outstandingly” with the Polish government and would continue to do so.

Even before the virus arrived in Kenya mid-March, tourism revenues had plummeted, with cancellations coming in from crucial markets such as China, Europe and the United States.

According to the tourism ministry, the sector has lost US$750 million this year -- roughly half of the total revenue in 2019.

""We were fully booked in June but now we have zero bookings. Nothing. It's terrible,"" said Jimmy Lemara, 40, the manager of an eco-lodge in the private Ol Kinyei conservancy.

In the Maasai Mara, one of Africa's most highly-rated wildlife reserves located in the vast flat plains of the Great Rift Valley, the local Maasai community, traditional herders who make up 2.5 percent of the population, now depend almost exclusively upon tourism for their livelihood.

In a unique model set up to engage local communities in tourism, enabling them to see the value of wildlife and thus protect it, the Maasai now get revenue from renting their land to form private wildlife conservancies.

Some work as cooks, guides and security guards in the lodges while others give tours of their traditional homes or sell homemade crafts to tourists.

'SURVIVAL MODE'

People in Talek, a dusty town situated at one of the entrances to the Maasai Mara national reserve, are gloomily buckling down, hoping for better days.

Kenya has announced international flights will resume on August 1, but the high season is already lost.

""Since December, work has been extremely low, and now we're in survival mode hoping to make 150 to 200 shillings ($1.4 to $1.9) a day, to be able to buy a meal,"" said Ibrahim Sameri, 38, whose small mechanic workshop can generate up to $30 a day in the high season.

Nalokiti Sayialel normally sells bead necklaces and bracelets to tourists passing through.

""It's been three months that I haven't sold anything,"" the 45-year-old told AFP.

""This is terrible. Everything is stuck. Everything is shut down. (I have) never seen something like that"", said tour guide Petro Nautori who has had no work since January.

The Maasai Mara national reserve, run by the Narok county government, extends to the north with several privately-managed conservancies renting land from the Maasai who in exchange do not graze their cattle or settle there.

This model has since 2005 allowed the doubling of the habitat for wildlife in this area.

On average, each land owner earns $220 per month, far more than the minimum wage in the area.

However like other conservancies, Ol Kinyei is struggling and has agreed to only pay half the usual rent to the Maasai, after having to pay back deposits to tourists who cancelled their holidays.

The salaries of lodge employees have also been cut by half.

FORCED TO SELL LIVESTOCK

Some Maasai families are having to turn to selling their precious livestock to earn money.

""Because we're getting little and it's not enough to sustain the family for a living, I had to sell two goats worth about 12,000 shillings to put on top of what I'm getting to keep me going,"" said Julius Sanare, 41, head chef at the eco-lodge in Ol Kinyei.

However livestock markets have been shut due to coronavirus prevention measures.

Residents said the Maasai are instead selling their animals on the black market for a pittance to unscrupulous buyers taking advantage of their desperation.

Mohanjeet Brar, managing director of Porini safari camps which run two conservancies and several lodges in the Mara, said the ""catastrophic"" situation could threaten the existence of the reserves.

""If the landowners are not getting any revenue, they can't feed themselves, they can't send their kids to schools, they would have no option but to look at other forms of land utilisation,"" he said.

""Fencing it off, selling it to people, building businesses... all those alternate land uses don't go together with wildlife and elephants and big cats and so this would be completely lost,"" he said.

""And once it's lost, if you look at Kenya and its very fast population growth rate and good economic growth over the last few years, it would be lost forever. It would be a real shame.""",[],690,0.9623733897493174

The WMO said there was a 20 per cent chance that it will exceed 1.5 C above 1850 to 1900 average levels in at least one year, according to its annual climate predictions for the coming five years.

The last five-year period has been the warmest five years on record, said the Geneva-based United Nations agency, which counts 193 member states.

Temperatures over the next five years, 2020 to 2024, are very likely to be within the range of 0.91 C to 1.59 C above pre-industrial levels.

Almost all regions, except parts of the southern oceans, are likely to be warmer than the recent past, which is defined as 1981 to 2010.

""This study shows -- with a high level of scientific skill -- the enormous challenge ahead in meeting the Paris Agreement on Climate Change target of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 C,"" said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas.

The 2015 Paris accord seeks to limit global temperature rises through sweeping cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.

WETTER SAHEL

The WMO forecasts do not take into account changes in greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions due to the shutdown of economic and industrial activity triggered by the coronavirus crisis.

""Due to the very long lifetime of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the impact of the drop in emissions this year is not expected to lead to a reduction of CO2 atmospheric concentrations which are driving global temperature increases,"" Taalas said.

The planet's average temperature is already more than 1.0 C warmer than the pre-industrial period, the WMO said.

Looking at the five-year period 2020 to 2024, the organisation said there was a 70 per cent chance that at least one month would be 1.5 C warmer than pre-industrial levels.

However, there is only a three per cent chance that the entire period would be 1.5 C warmer than that baseline level.

The northern North Atlantic region could have stronger westerly winds, leading to more storms in western Europe over the next five years.

High latitude regions and the Sahel are likely to be wetter than the recent past, the organisation predicted.

The WMO also said that in 2020 alone, many parts of South America, southern Africa and Australia are likely to be drier than the recent past.

Meanwhile, the Arctic is likely to have warmed by more than twice as much as the global mean.

Denver based start-up Boom Supersonic has announced it will roll out XB-1, a 1:3 scale prototype of its upcoming supersonic commercial jet Overture, on October 7, with test flights beginning in 2021.

The move will help to pave the way for the first commercial supersonic flights since the legendary delta-wing passenger airliner made its last flight in 2003.

""XB-1 is the first step in bringing supersonic travel back to the world,"" Blake Scholl, founder and CEO of Boom Supersonic, said in a statement on the company's website.

SUPERSONIC FLIGHT REVIVAL

""Flights at twice the speed mean we can travel twice as far -- bringing more people, places, and cultures into our lives.""

According to Boom, the purpose of XB-1 is to demonstrate and prove the ""key technologies"" for Overture, such as advanced carbon fiber composite construction and computer-optimized high-efficiency aerodynamics.

The company has also released images of the experimental aircraft, described as ""history's fastest privately developed aircraft,"" in the hangar, including the completion of its wing installation.

""Our experiences in the Covid-19 pandemic underscore for all of us the fundamental human need for personal connection,"" says Scholl.

""Faster travel enables us to experience the world's people, cultures, and places. With XB-1, we're demonstrating that we are prepared to bring back supersonic.""

The results of the XB-1 test program, which claims to be 100% carbon neutral, will allow the company to fine tune the design for supersonic airliner Overture.

'DEMAND HAS GROWN'

""We're ensuring that the supersonic future is safe and environmentally and economically sustainable,"" he added.

""We've learned that the demand for supersonic has grown even faster than we anticipated.""

Before the pandemic, Boom had garnered at least $6 billion worth of pre-orders for the aircraft, which has a price tag of $200 million, with buyers included Virgin Group and Japan Airlines, which invested $10 million in the company in 2017.

If all goes to plan, Overture, which is designed to seat between 55 to 75 people, will begin passenger flights in 2030. It will focus on over 500 primarily transoceanic routes that will benefit from the aircraft's Mach-2.2 speeds -- such as New York to London, a journey that would take just three hours and 15 minutes.

The aircraft has been designed with the latest noise-reducing technologies and will only fly at supersonic speeds while over oceans to ensure that populated areas are not affected by sonic booms.

Boom isn't the only company attempting to bring supersonic flights back.

Aerion Corporation is currently developing a passenger AS2 supersonic jet, which can hold up to 12 passengers, at its headquarters in Reno, Nevada.",[],435,0.9752677296631332

Backstopped by more than $500 million in new funding over the next five years, Ottawa's newly released cybersecurity strategy lays out a range of initiatives to help Canadians, business and the government better protect against cyberthreats.

The strategy was the result of nearly two years of consultations with industry, academics and other experts, and updates the first such plan released by the Harper Conservatives in 2010.

It comes as the internet and digital technology play an increasingly important role in every aspect of life, making many functions easier and leading to new economic opportunities -- but also opening the country and Canadians up to new risks.

And those risks appear to be increasing: The RCMP says that police services across the country received 24,000 reports of cybercrimes in 2016, which represented a 58 per cent increase over the previous two years.

There are also growing concerns about the threat posed by foreign states, terrorist groups and others who may try to target the country's electricity grids, banking services, hospitals and election systems.

The new cybersecurity strategy does three things, starting with an increased emphasis on detecting, deterring and prosecuting cybercrime, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told a news conference on Parliament Hill.

""We must substantially strengthen Canada's cybersecurity capabilities to better protect ourselves and our systems against evolving cyberthreats,"" he said, ""while also enlarging our capacity to combat cybercrime and prosecute offenders.""

To that end, the RCMP will add new cyber-investigators and become the main focal point for police across the country to report illegal activity online. It will also liaise with foreign partners to identify potential threats and crack down on criminal networks.

The strategy also brings the various cybersecurity efforts underway in different federal departments under a new Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, Goodale said, which will be housed at the Communications Security Establishment and open in the fall.

And it will attempt to help the private sector, especially small businesses, which officials say were the victims of 71 per cent of data breaches, better protect themselves, including through a voluntary certification program.

""They comprise a huge chunk of the Canadian economy,"" Goodale said of small businesses.

""And they are as interconnected as the rest of us to their suppliers upstream and to their customers downstream, so if they have a cyber problem, that whole network could be infected.""

Yet it wasn't immediately clear how the government intended to address what will be one of the biggest hurdles to successfully implementing the plan's ambitious goals: a shortage of cybersecurity specialists, both in Canada and around the world.

""A shortage of cybersecurity talent makes it difficult for organization -- including the federal government -- to attract and retain the people they need to improve their cybersecurity or to disrupt cyberthreats,"" the new strategy reads.

Goodale described the shortage as ""a huge challenge and a huge opportunity,"" noting that the cybersecurity industry in Canada already supports an estimated 11,000 jobs and generates $1.6 billion in economic activity -- numbers the government hopes to grow.

""The world will be demanding people with these talents and skills who understand cybersecurity and can deliver the goods for their employers,"" Goodale said, ""whether they are in the private sector or the public sector.""

But while the most recent federal budget set aside $8 million for up to 1,000 student work placements in cybersecurity, the strategy doesn't include a dedicated focus on skills training or set aside funding to help grow the industry.

""It's disappointing to see a lack of commitment to build Canada's cyber sector,"" said Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, which represents many of Canada's tech companies.

""Cyber is the fastest growing ICT sector in the world and domestic innovators present an opportunity for our government to grow our economy and deploy world-class technology solutions for protecting Canada's digital borders.""

The plan was also largely silent about foreign-owned telecommunications companies such as Huawei, which intelligence chiefs in the U.S. have identified as a national security risk, and made no mention of encrypting personal communications.

The latter has been a contentious issue between privacy advocates and law enforcement, who have argued that such encryption poses a barrier to investigations.

Goodale acknowledged the debate, saying that while it is obviously important for online banking and other commercial activities, ""there are important questions about law enforcement and national security being able to properly conduct investigations.""

A joint letter Tuesday calls on CEO Sundar Pichai to explain what Google is doing to safeguard users from the Chinese government's censorship and surveillance.

It describes the company's secretive plan to build a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship as representing ""an alarming capitulation by Google on human rights.""

""The Chinese government extensively violates the rights to freedom of expression and privacy; by accommodating the Chinese authorities' repression of dissent, Google would be actively participating in those violations for millions of internet users in China,"" the letter says.

In a statement, Google said it has ""been investing for many years to help Chinese users, from developing Android, through mobile apps such as Google Translate and Files Go, and our developer tools. But our work on search has been exploratory, and we are not close to launching a search product in China.""

In the U.S., President Donald Trump and other conservatives have lobbed charges of censorship at Google and other U.S. tech companies, though they haven't provided evidence. On Tuesday, Trump claimed that Google had rigged search results about him ""so that almost all stories & news is BAD."" A top adviser said the White House is ""taking a look"" at whether Google should face federal regulation. The companies deny the accusations.

The rights groups' expression of concern over a Chinese search engine follows a letter earlier this month from more than a thousand Google employees protesting the China plans. The letter called on executives to review ethics and transparency at the company.

Google had previously complied with censorship controls starting in 2006 as it sought a toehold in the booming Chinese economy. But it exited the Chinese search market in 2010 under unrelenting pressure from human rights groups and some shareholders.

Tuesday's letter, signed by groups including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders, said China's controls over the internet have only strengthened since then amid an overall crackdown on civil liberties and freedom of expression. The letter said it would be difficult for Google to relaunch a search engine ""in a way that would be compatible with the company's human rights responsibilities under international standards, or its own commitments.""

According to online news site The Intercept, Google created a custom Android app that will automatically filter out sites blocked by China's so-called ""Great Firewall.""

Google co-founder Sergey Brin was born in the Soviet Union in 1973 and lived there until age 6 when his family fled. He has said his experience with a repressive regime shaped his and the company's views.

However, Pichai, who became CEO in 2015, has said he wants Google to be in China serving Chinese users.

In December, Google announced it was opening an artificial intelligence lab in Beijing, and in June, Google invested $550 million in JD.com, a Chinese e-commerce platform that is second only to Alibaba in the country. The companies said they would collaborate on retail solutions around the world without mentioning China, where Google services including Gmail and YouTube are blocked.",[],527,0.9660353139208578

Twenty-four-year-old Kia Ebrahimian was charged in connection to three deaths on Friday, Sgt. Frank Jang of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team, said Monday.

Jang said one of the victims, 50-year-old Tatiana Bazyar, was the accused's mother. Another victim, 23-year-old Medea ""Befrin"" Ebrahimian, was his sibling.

Homicide investigators believe the accused's mother and the third victim, 46-year-old Francesco Zangrilli, were in a common-law relationship. All four were living in the same home.

Jang said the case garnered ""significant interest"" in the community, especially around safety.

""Today, given that everyone – from the victims to the accused – were all part of the same household, we didn't really have any further concerns to the community,"" he said.

On June 13, first responders attended a fire at a Langley home on Wakefield Drive near 196 Street.

Investigators said at the time they found a man's body at the back of the house and that he had ""injuries consistent with homicide."" Two other peoples' remains were also found inside the home.

""There is no other word than tragic to describe what happened,"" Jang said. ""That family, I can definitely say, was not known to police and did not have any record of criminality.""

Police say they were called to a bush fire at Blundell Neighbourhood Park at about 4:30 a.m. Friday.

Someone walking in the area – which is close to an elementary school – noticed the fire and put it out before emergency crews got to the scene.

Police say evidence gathered from the fire suggested it was intentionally set and that it appeared to be similar to 15 other fires that have been set in the city since the start of the year.

Now, Mounties say they're looking for a possible serial arsonist.

According to police, the fires were lit in hedges, garbage bins and in portable toilets in construction sites. Usually they've been set between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.

Like many aspects of life as we knew it before the global health crisis, the hosts of the 34th annual festival and fundraiser are finding a new way to carry on while also working to stop the spread of COVID-19.

Rather than draw hundreds of people together to eat, watch live entertainment, socialize and eat some more, the festival is now drive-thru only. No live show, no dancing, no gathering alongside the neighbours outside St. Nicholas and Dimitrios Greek Orthodox Church at Boundary and East 29th Ave in East Vancouver.

""A lot of people are making larger orders, picking it up and going,"" said Ready. ""Whereas if they were here, they would probably join their friends, have a meal, sit for a while, take in a show, have a snack, have dessert, have a couple of beers, a couple of wines and then they would go.

""We will definitely be providing some kind of pick up or deli service in the future or delivery service in the future because it’s been working so well. It's great for some people who don't want to come and sit here. They just want good Greek food.""

With the guidance of provincial health officers, organizers have been able to establish safety protocols and guidelines in order to go ahead. Ready said the fate of the festival was ""questionable"" until they settled on the drive-thru model since groups of 50 people are prohibited in B.C.

Customers order ahead online through the festival’s website and are asked to stay in their vehicles while their food is delivered to them. People are asked not to stay on site to eat. All servers and festival volunteers are expected to wear masks.

The festival is also charging a 50-cent markup called the ""COVID-19 recovery fee"" to cover additional safety precautions such as protective equipment, sanitizer and cleaning. But for anyone who feels the fee is unfair or those safety measures unwarranted, they offer a code to avoid payment.

Ready said the Greek Orthodox Community of East Vancouver relies on the festival to fund events and services throughout the year, including programs for seniors and youth as well as Greek heritage and language lessons. They have plans to build a permanent daycare and preschool.

""This will be a fraction of what we normally raise,"" she said. ""We are hoping we'll get by OK. We have a lot of support from our community and corporate donors that are trying to help us out.""

""Strawberries, raspberries and blueberries — they don’t wait for anyone,"" says operations manager, Gurlene Maan. ""They don't care that there's a pandemic happening — they're growing.""

She says they added hand-washing stations and additional hand sanitizers throughout the property, hired more staff to enforce physical distancing and also created an online reservation for u-pickers.

""By introducing time slots, it was a great way to be able to control how many people are using the activities in our Barnyard Adventure Land and control how many people are in the fields,"" she says.

Despite the fact u-picking allows visitors to space out across the fields, Maan says they haven’t seen an uptick in visitors.

""COVID has definitely affected us. People aren't likely to leave their home as much as they would have last year, so I don't think the numbers are up,"" she says.

But their farm offers something else that has grown in popularity: goat yoga.

They host yoga classes with the four-legged creatures roughly every two weeks. Maan says those classes have filled up quickly.

""We have had sold-out classes because people are looking for something to do and people are wanting to go outside,"" she says.

Those are the same reasons that brought Jonathan Ma and his children to the farm.

The kids seemed particularly enamoured by the goats in the petting zoo.

""We saw that they have a lot of kid-friendly activities, and our kids love animals,"" he says, adding he's also pleased to see health precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Maan encourages more people to support local farms.

""It is a great, family-fun activity to be outside and see animals and connect with nature and basically pick your own food.""",[],352,0.9569742329551899

It's busy during the day, but at night, many people avoid it all together.

""It really just doesn’t feel safe,"" said Surrey resident Selena Werner-Bellon.

Surrey RCMP reported a woman was robbed and sexually assaulted on the path around 10:45 p.m. Friday, July 10.

""As the woman was going under the Expo Line towards Fraser Hwy., she was approached by a man who was unknown to her,"" said Cpl. Elenore Sturko. ""That individual robbed her of her personal belongings then pulled her into the wooded area and sexually assaulted her.""

The path that connects the station to the homes on the Fraser Hwy., has LED lighting, but residents say they're ineffective at best.

""The lights go on and out,"" said Werner-Bellon. ""Sometimes there's large gaps of darkness because the lights just won't work altogether.""

Another resident told CTV News the lights ""never, ever work.""

The walkway is also surrounded by tall trees and dense bush that block views from nearly every side.

CTV News contacted the City of Surrey for comment. We are waiting for a response from the engineering department.

The suspect is described as a white man, aged 30 to 40 years and 5'10"" tall. He was wearing a red and blue bandana on his face and was dressed in black.

The politician made the announcement on Twitter, adding that this June 30th also marked his 60th wedding anniversary with his wife Kathy, and the occasion seemed like a good time to announce his retirement.

B.C.’s next civic election takes place Oct. 15, 2022.

“I joined the CCF [Co-operative Commonwealth Federation] party to fight to save farmland in 1960 and was elected the first president of the BC NDP Youth in 1961,” Steves wrote, adding that Kathy has always “quietly shared my workload.”

The Steves family have farmed in Richmond for decades, and the couple still run the family farm and live in the 103-year-old home on the property.

Steves first got interested in politics over a fight to save the farm in the 1950s. A university student at the time, and said he came home one day to find his father saying they would have to go out of business.

50 years on #RichmondBC Council, 60 years married to my partner Kathy who quietly shares my workload, 60 years an activist. I joined the CCF party to fight to save farmland in 1960 and was elected the first president of the #BCNDP Youth in 1961 https://t.co/TUA1cGjMZv — ClimateChange Steves (@Harold_Steves) July 11, 2020

That’s because the city had denied his dad a permit to build a new dairy – a requirement during that period because Canadian regulators were requiring dairies to update to modern equipment. The Steves family found out their land and the land of many other farming families had been quietly rezoned for residential use.

“No one knew how to fight city hall,” Steves told CTV News Vancouver. “The taxes were going up and nobody knew what to do about it.”

The fight to protect farmland has motivated Steves throughout his long political career. He joined the CCF, the precursor to the New Democratic Party, and pushed for the creation of a land bank for farmland, an idea that would eventually become B.C.’s Agriculture Land Reserve.

Steves was first elected as a City of Richmond alderman in 1968, a post he held until 1973. From 1973 to 1975 he served as a B.C. NDP MLA, then returned to Richmond city council in 1977. He’s served as a city councillor continuously ever since.

Steves said his wife has been the backbone of his political career, doing all his filing and also reading countless reports. They met at the University of British Columbia, where Harold was studying agriculture and Kathy was studying nuclear physics.

“She does this all behind the scenes – basically it’s been the two of us together for 60 years,” Steves said.

The couple have five children and eight grandchildren.

Steves has been a stalwart critic of the B.C. government’s decision to build the Site C dam in the Peace region, warning that with the anticipated effects of climate change, the province couldn’t afford to lose valuable farmland.

In recent years, he’s fought to bring in changes to the size of houses allowed on farmland in Richmond, arguing that the large mansions that are currently allowed have led to rising land prices.

Steves said he plans to continue with his activism work, which is centred around protecting farmland and promoting the importance of strong local food systems.

He’s looking forward to continuing work on a plan to create 300 allotment gardens on some of the Garden City lands in Richmond, and ongoing work to create community garden plots in some city parks and develop incubator farms.",[],591,0.9723024382342017

In the past week, the number of new cases has increased steadily. On July 10, provincial health officials announced 25 new cases, the biggest increase since early May.

Friday, July 10: 25 new cases

July 9: 20 new cases

July 8: 18 new cases

July 7: 12 new cases

July 6: 7 new cases

July 5: 15 new cases

July 4: 9 new cases

""I'm not losing sleep at this point over the increase in cases right now but it’s something that I think needs to be watched very carefully,"" said Dan Coombs, a UBC mathematics professor who studies epidemiology modelling and has previously worked with the province on its overdose response.

""We have to recognize that we’re in a very delicate position,"" he told CTV News Vancouver.

Coombs said it's difficult to say why B.C. is seeing this increase in positive case numbers. There have been no new outbreaks at long-term care homes, and cases appear to be affecting younger people while there are also more incidents of community infection.

His biggest concern comes from the other side of the world, where Melbourne is entering a second lockdown. Stage 3 stay-at-home orders were announced for the Australian city on July 8 after the state of Victoria recorded 191 new cases in a few days.

Vancouver and Melbourne have shared a “broadly similar experience,” said Coombs, noting a pressing but unanswered question remains whether the cases will continue to rise or if these numbers will flatten.

He doesn't think B.C. is poised to return scale back its reopening or return to lockdown measures. ""I don't think we’re near that point yet, but the events in Australia in Melbourne indicate that this could be a possibility if things do increase rapidly.""

The next update from the provincial health officer is expected Tuesday, when B.C. will report on three days' worth of data.",[],319,0.892930148696794

When the pandemic started and the B.C. film industry was forced to shut down, Thomas FX Group Inc. also had to close its doors.

As John and Betty Quee brainstormed on how they could reopen safely, they also had many questions.

""We can all wear personal protective equipment,"" John says, ""but what about the environment that we're working in, how does that get sanitized? How do we kill the viruses that are in the air or on surfaces?""

They purchased some equipment resembling a fog machine but instead, it gets filled with disinfecting liquid and then sprayed onto surfaces.

They kept on hunting for ideas and that's when they stumbled upon American company Biotech UV.

""The real advantage of using UV lighting is it's economical and it's very safe and it's not chemically enhanced with anything,"" says Betty.

She says the ultraviolet light can sanitize and disinfect 20 square feet each minute, so a 340 square foot room can be cleaned in 17 minutes.

Two weeks ago, the B.C. film industry officially got the green light to operate again as the province welcomed the third phase of the reopening plan.

WorkSafeBC created the guidelines that the industry must follow to keep crews and actors safe.

Betty says the industry has unique challenges.

""The really big concern in the film industry is everybody uses the same equipment and costumes. When they finish their scene, then they have to sanitize their wardrobes and costumes,"" she says.

The Quees believe BioTech could be a solution, as it can sanitize in a matter of minutes.

""In searching for a solution to help the film industry reopen, we just thought, 'Let's pivot and help all Canadian businesses reopen,'"" John says.

Thomas FX is now the only Canadian distributor of BioTech, stocking 16 different items that range from $70 to $1,700.

Instead of selling fake snow to studios, they're now selling UV machines to households and businesses across the country.

""This is less about making money and more about saving lives and creating something that gives people confidence to come in public and go back to their jobs,"" John says.",[],366,0.9637622775531741

Among them was Wang’s roommate Shayla Raine.

Raine explained that she wasn’t home on the January night when security video captured Kelowna RCMP officer Cpl. Lacy Browning executing the now controversial wellness check at her apartment.

“When I came back and opened the suite it looked like a crime scene,” she said. “I had to stuff my nose with tissue because the smell of blood.”

Troubling video of the incident emerged in June, prompting the head of B.C. RCMP’s southeast division to issue an apology to Mona Wang.

“When I first saw the video I was deeply concerned. And I’m very sorry to Ms. Wang for what occurred,” said Chief Superintendent Brad Haugli on July 2.

Mona Wang has launched a lawsuit claiming she was assaulted and abused by Browning who was dispatched to Wang’s residence to check on her wellbeing.

Surveillance video shows a handcuffed Wang, dressed only in a bra and leggings, being dragged facedown by her wrists and arms down a hallway and through the building’s lobby by the female officer.

No video has emerged to show what took place in the apartment but Raine believes much of the alleged assault happened out of view of cameras.

“Mona could not have possibly gotten broken blood vessels in her eyes or bruises on all of her legs and abdomen from only being dragged down the carpet or having her head stepped on or hair pulled,” Raine said.

“There was definitely more that happened inside the apartment and it was evidently clear from the crime scene I had to clean up.""

At the Vancouver rally close to 100 people also gathered to support Wang’s advocacy for an end to wellness checks without mental health professionals present.

None of the allegations against Browning have been proven in court. The RCMP has said a code of conduct review and a criminal investigation is underway.

The BC Human Rights Tribunal has ordered a man to pay his former house cleaner just over $44,000 in damages for sexually harassing and assaulting her while she worked for him.

According to the June 26 decision, the woman, who the tribunal refers to as M.P., began working for the man, J.S., in 2011. At that time her employer, who the tribunal refers to as J.S., was still married. His wife died in 2013.

At first, J.S. and M.P. had a warm and friendly relationship, according to the tribunal’s decision. She referred to him and his wife as Uncle and Auntie, and after J.S.’s wife died, M.P. and her husband included J.S. on some family outings.

But as early as 2012, according to M.P.’s testimony to the tribunal, J.S. would touch her shoulder or buttocks from time to time. The contact escalated over the years, to the point where J.S. would attempt to touch M.P.’s breasts and genitals and remove her clothing, and would repeatedly attempted to pull her down on his bed.

While M.P. attempted to stop working for him around 2015 or 2016, she and her husband testified that J.S. came to their home to ask why she had stopped coming to his house to clean.

M.P. testified that J.S. had threatened to tell her husband about what was going on and “break her family up,” so she returned to work.

M.P. testified J.S.’s unwanted sexual touching and coercion escalated in 2017, until an incident on Oct. 27, 2017 when she said he pulled her down on the bed, touched her breasts and her genitals and attempted to have intercourse with her.

For his part, J.S. testified that the sexual relationship had been consensual and that he had paid M.P. money after the encounters.

However, tribunal member Emily Ohler said that on the whole, she found the testimony of M.P. and her husband more credible than J.S.’s account. Ohler found that M.S. had been discriminated against on the basis of sex.

Ohler ordered J.S. to pay M.P. $40,000 for “injury to dignity, feelings and self‐respect,” as well as $4,300 for wages lost as a result of the discrimination. Ohler also ordered J.S. to pay a total of $156 to cover medication and tribunal hearing expenses.",[],377,0.985239274955443

Marcel Hanson recorded the ordeal using his phone, and said he and other beachgoers at the popular South Surrey beach attempted to help the family by calling a tow-truck and the fire department.

But the sand on that part of the beach also claimed one of the tow trucks, which eventually had to be pulled out with a second tow truck.

“We were just relaxing at Blackie Spit on Crescent Beach,” Hanson said. “All of a sudden this G-Wagon (Mercedes SUV) with a trailer with a Sea-doo on it comes down the ramp there, through the sand.”

Hanson said he was surprised to see the vehicle driving on the beach, which is near the sailing club; most people who bring their boats down to the beach use a hand-trailer to move relatively light sailboats, and they usually put boats into the water at high tide.

Hanson observed the SUV going further and further into the mud on the beach.

“I thought ‘Oh my gosh, this is not going to end well,’” Hanson said

Several people gathered to see if they could help, and eventually Hanson called several tow truck companies – but all the companies said they wouldn’t be able to send a truck for two to three hours.

On the advice of the sailing club staff, one of the beachgoers also called the fire department. A Surrey RCMP officer also arrived at one point.

Clover Towing eventually did arrive, sending three trucks. One of those trucks got stuck itself, and had to be pulled out by another truck.

Two to three hours later, the Mercedes and the tow truck were finally unstuck. Based on what he heard from the sailing club staff, Hanson said it appears this happens around once a year.

Hanson said while the event made for “good entertainment” to beachgoers, “I felt really sorry for the people.""

Some indicated changes brought on by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced opening hours and distancing.

But this sign referred to what some say is an unpleasant byproduct of current conditions: bad customer behaviour.

Under the title “Unacceptable,” the sign called out what was described as “appalling” disrespect and abuse towards staff.

“If you think you will be unable to behave in a calm, respectful manner and accept our current situation with empathy and an expectation of compromise, we kindly ask you to shop elsewhere,” it read.

George Schwab told CTV News he used to work at the store earlier this year, and experienced some rude customer behaviour himself.

“There is a sense that people, with their frustration, feel they can take it out on the employees,” Schwab said, and added they would try to explain the changes were for everyone’s safety, but it didn’t help.

“They ramp it up even more, and more, to the point where they’ve called myself, they’ve called all the employees….pretty derogatory names and swear words that we can’t say on TV. And it’s really sad.”

CTV News tried to reach the store’s independent owner, but did not hear back.

Home Hardware’s director of communications, Jessica Kuepfer, said while the sign was not one they provided to the store, the intention behind it was to try and protect employees.

“He wasn’t out of line in terms of suggesting that customers act in a kind and courteous manner,” Kuepfer said, and added shoppers have experienced a lot of change, and emotions are heightened. “We’re all dealing with a global pandemic, and as we strive to keep our stores safe, we ask that customers extend that level of safety and kindness back.”

Kuepfer said Home Hardware has created its own signs, which were also visible at the Davie Street store, reminding people that aggression, intimidation, and harassment will not be tolerated, and anyone behaving in that way will be asked to leave.

“We certainly did unfortunately need to create that sign in the last little while,"" she said. “We understand that it is a difficult and unusual time for everyone…we do ask that everyone is mindful of being a little more kind than necessary.”

Director of government relations for the Retail Council of Canada Greg Wilson said increased anxiety has ramped up the number of “problematic” interactions.

“I think people are accustomed to grocery stores and other stores being the same, and that they’re not right now completely the same, so I think there’s an element of that,” Wilson said, and added he thinks over the longer term, more businesses will end up investing in de-escalation training for their employees. “We encourage everybody to be kind, and remember that the employee in that retail store is also very anxious about their own health.”

Over the course of the day, a store employee came out and removed the unofficial sign, saying he was told to do so.

Kuepfer said the store owner made a decision to take the sign down, but was not asked to take that action.

Schwab said he remains grateful to the customers who were kind and would stand up to other shoppers getting out of line with the staff.

“I would just restate what Dr. Bonnie Henry has said all the time: Be kind, be safe, and be calm,” he said.",[],564,0.957446178874904

The entire ordeal has left Kevin McIntosh shaking his head as he waits out another two-week quarantine at home.

""It's asinine, is it not?"" asked the 63-year-old, who lives a short distance from the U.S. border crossing into The Point.

""I put myself at probably substantial risk of being exposed to COVID-19 when it could have been done so simply by just going eight blocks across the border.""

McIntosh is the man behind an online petition urging the government to let B.C. residents with property in Point Roberts briefly cross the border to do necessary maintenance on homes and water vessels.

The roughly 2,800 signatories are calling for a special dispensation to access the small, sparsely populated pene-exclave (an area that can only be reached by passing through another area) to do things like shut off water, disconnect gas lines and secure their vacation properties from the threat of skunk and raccoon infestations.

In McIntosh's case, his primary concern was his 42-foot powerboat sinking at Point Roberts Marina, potentially releasing 400 U.S. gallons of diesel fuel into the ocean.

There are regular power interruptions at the marina, McIntosh said, and they sometimes mess with his boat's battery charging system. No battery power would mean no bilge pumps.

""Any water intrusion into the bilges would eventually fill it up and sink it,"" McIntosh said. ""You can imagine the problems that would ensue from an event like that, and I'm being prevented by the land border crossing agents from accessing the boat.""

Some residents have ponied up to have their boats towed back to Canada, but McIntosh said his was in pieces and not fit for moving. He was partway through the process of servicing his raw water cooling system when the pandemic hit back in March.

McIntosh credits one border guard with allowing him to briefly enter Point Roberts to check on the boat back on May 14, but he was only given 30 minutes to rush in and rush out. The guard made a strong impression, McIntosh said, that if he took a minute longer there would be hell to pay.

That little expedition triggered his first two-week quarantine at home.

After his petition garnered little traction, and after being brushed off by his local MP's office, McIntosh finally decided to try flying into the U.S. last Friday - despite some misgivings about spending time on an international flight, and in Washington state, where the COVID-19 case count is about 13 times higher than B.C.'s.

While his pleas have mostly fallen on deaf ears at the land crossing, McIntosh said the U.S. customs agents who screened him at Vancouver International Airport deemed his concerns a valid reason for entry.

He was ultimately able to fly to Seattle on a plane ticket that cost about $310, rent a car to drive to Bellingham for $134, and charter a flight to Point Roberts that cost him US$135.

That charter would have cost US$375, McIntosh said, but by sheer luck there were two other people looking to fly over to The Point that day.

He reached his boat Friday afternoon, and had it repaired and ready to move by the following Wednesday. McIntosh finally arrived at Steveston for customs clearance on Thursday, allowing him to begin his second quarantine.

Isobel MacKenzie believes changes to how the province provides long-term care are absolutely needed, but that a public inquiry would take too long to conduct. She said the circumstances will be reviewed, however.

“Whether it is what we would call a full blown public inquiry or whether it is looking at what happened and finding out what went wrong, where and why, certainly I believe the minister of health has indicated we are going to be doing that. I know my office will be doing that,” she said.

A number of family members came forward this week to speak about what they described as a disturbing lack of support for seniors at the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak at Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver. They have been calling for such an inquiry, even as B.C. Premier John Horgan has repeatedly rejected the idea.

The families said they saw seniors' calls for help go unanswered, and residents left in urine-soaked clothing for extended periods of time.

Mackenzie told CTV News one of the biggest issues facing long-term care is inadequate staffing, which impacts everything from feeding to bathing to bathroom use.

“We were seeing the impact of that magnified many times over in Lynn Valley (Care Centre),” MacKenzie said.

She suggested Lynn Valley, the first care home in the country to report a COVID-19 death, became a tragic learning ground.

""From that suffering came some positive outcomes in terms of learning what we could do better in subsequent care homes,” she said.

The MLA for North Vancouver-Seymour, Jane Thornthwaite, agrees that ""more could have been done,"" but also that a public inquiry would take too long to complete.

""We definitely need an independent review,"" Thornthwaite added. ""And it should start immediately.""

Of the 186 deaths from COVID-19 in B.C., almost three quarters have been linked to nursing homes.

From staff shortages to care aides infecting residents in multiple homes, efforts in some care facilities clearly failed to stop the spread of the virus.

And there continue to be significant outbreaks at seniors' homes in the province. The most recent is at Holy Family Hospital in Vancouver, where 13 residents have died.

Haro Park lost 11 seniors, and 25 residents died at Langley Lodge, which has had two COVID-19 outbreaks since the start of the pandemic.

“Langley Lodge invites some questions about how did that get so out of control so quickly given what we knew around controls at that point in the pandemic,” MacKenzie said.

Both the seniors' advocate and Thornthwaite agree change is needed.

The MLA also said there's ""not enough emphasis on giving seniors the support they need to stay at home as long as they possibly can and then the next issue is an entire revamp on the staffing.""

The seniors’ advocate expects her investigation to be complete by the fall, before an anticipated second wave of COVID-19 hits the province.",[],497,0.9567232911076712

According to Statistics Canada's monthly labour force survey released Friday, B.C.'s unemployment rate was at 13 per cent in June – down from 13.4 per cent the month before. Nationwide, the rate was 12.3 per cent, down from 13.7.

The survey results were gathered from June 14 to 20, which Finance Minister Carole James said was ""right in the middle of (B.C.'s) gradual economic reopening.""

""The data released today for British Columbians paints a picture of cautious optimism with a long road ahead of us,"" James said Friday morning.

""We continue to see positive signs as a result of B.C.'s restart plan.""

B.C. has been in a state of emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic since mid-March.

But things are starting to improve in the province's economy and James said more than 118,000 people found jobs last month. She also said the employment gains made in both May and June brought back about 40 per cent of the total job losses seen since February.

""So no question these numbers are encouraging, but as I said, we have a long road to go,"" James said, adding that thousands of B.C. residents and businesses are still struggling.

""The total net job loss since the start of the pandemic stands at 235,000 … while that's a large number, those are people, those are families, those are individuals in communities.""

In May, Canada reported a record-high unemployment rate, but also saw signs of recovery in June.

More locally, however, at least four B.C. cities saw their unemployment rates go up in June.

Vancouver 13.1 per cent (up from 10.7)

Kelowna 10.2 per cent (up from 9.6)

Abbotsford-Mission 8.8 per cent (up from 7.5)

Victoria 11 per cent (up from 10.1)

James said ""there's no question"" that these increased unemployment rates in some cities is because of the challenges facing service and tourist sectors.

""You would, by now in Vancouver and in Victoria, be seeing cruise ships coming in, seeing passengers unload, be seeing people through the downtown core,"" she said. ""And that's just not possible.""

Services sector, youth hit hardest

James said B.C.'s services sector continues to be the hardest hit since the start of the pandemic.

However, with businesses reopening in the province's restart, she said this sector has also seen significant job gains recently.

""In fact, the accommodation and food services sector accounts for 50 per cent of this month's gain in jobs,"" she said.

James also said youth are still seeing a significant unemployment rate in the province at 29.1 per cent, which is slightly higher than it was in May.

Moving ahead, James said following provincial health orders and guidelines remains important.

""We need to stay focused on our restart plan, doing it in a responsible way so we can see more and more businesses reopen,"" James said.

""The best recovery for our economy is making sure that we continue to fight COVID-19.""",[],483,0.9419602927181735

Transit Police confirmed she was attacked just before 10 o’clock the night of May 12, at the Main Street-Science World SkyTrain Station.

The victim is seen approaching the fare gates on Main Street, when a man wearing shorts, T-shirt and a baseball cap comes into frame, winds up and slugs her in the back of head. The woman’s wig and belongings fall to the floor, and then the man is seen taking off.

The next images show the victim getting up and looking bewildered as she collects her possessions off the station floor.

The footage was captured by the security camera of a neighbouring condominium.

“Acts of violence occur all the time in this neighbourhood,” said Patricia Chartrand, who lives in the building at Main and Terminal.

“It’s horrific and shocking. It’s gotten progressively worse, and more and more dangerous.""

“When our kids (are) here, they’re afraid to walk in this area,” said another resident of the building. “Sometime we’re all afraid.”

Witnesses saw the man in the video cross the street moments after the SkyTrain attack and smash the glass of a bus stop stand.

Both Transit Police and the Vancouver Police Department acknowledged issues in the neighbourhood.

“We do have additional officers and resources working that area,” said VPD spokesperson Sgt. Aaron Roed.

Transit Police confirmed they tracked the attacker down and have recommended assault charges. They are also seeking a warrant for his arrest, but so far nothing has been approved by Crown.

That means the man is still at large.

“I want the city to pull their socks up,"" said resident Patricia Chartrand.

After 20 years as a condo owner in the building near the corner of Main Street and Terminal Avenue, Chartrand explained the situation has become dangerous.

“On the weekend I had some gentleman out here throw a container of food at me,” she said.

Residents are perturbed at the amount of garbage, drug paraphernalia and graffiti they see in the area despite it being a major transit connection and close to tourist attractions like Science World.

“I never know what to expect there could be people lying, sleeping, guys doing drugs and shooting up, “ said long-time resident Mort Broverman.

The residents explain that the breaking point came in the spring after a random assault just steps from a neighbouring SkyTrain entrance led to Transit police recommending multiple charges.

The incident was captured on the building’s security cameras.

In the video a man is seen walking up to another person and punching them from behind.

Transit police told CTV News that after a full investigation the suspect was identified.

The residents of several condo units near the intersection have also paid for a temporary fence to block people from openly using drugs on a courtyard area outside their front doors.

Jamie Bacon, who has been identified in previous trials as the former leader of the Red Scorpion gang, entered a guilty plea Thursday afternoon to conspiracy to commit the murder of 21 year-old Corey Lal, one of the victims of the Surrey six killings in October 2007.

Six people ended up being killed in execution-style shootings in a Surrey condo, including two innocent bystanders: Chris Mohan, who lived across the hall, and Ed Schellenberg, who was doing maintenance work on a gas fireplace.

Eileen Mohan, Chris Mohan’s mother, was in court to hear the pleas.

“He could have done this 10 years ago,” she said. “He made a calculated plea deal to set himself free.”

In May, the B.C. Court of Appeal had ordered a new trial for Bacon in connection with the Surrey six killings after prosecutors appealed a December 2017 stay of the charges involved. Bacon had also originally been charged with first degree murder in the case. That charge is now expected to be stayed.

Crying could be heard in court as Bacon appeared by video. He also pleaded guilty to counselling to commit murder in connection with a 2008 shooting.

The Crown and defence are making a joint sentencing submission of 18 years on the conspiracy charge, and 10 for the counselling charge, to be served concurrently. The maximum possible sentence carried by each charge is life, and there is no minimum sentence. Bacon has been in jail since his arrest in 2009, and will also get credit for time already served.

Outside court, Bacon’s defence lawyer Kevin Westell said if the judge accepts their proposal, factoring in time served, his client will have “somewhere between five or six years left to serve.”

“This has been a long, deliberative process of coming to the right agreement with the Crown,” Westell said. “We think, for many reasons, we’ve come to a resolution that’s principled, and is appropriate from all sides.”

Mohan said she hopes the judge considers how long it’s taken to come to this point.

“Mr. Bacon has dragged us since 2009, to plead guilty, and he didn’t. So maybe the judge will take that into account, and give him the sentence that’s really due to him,” she said. “It’s not just my son’s life. And that has to be taken into consideration, that six people’s lives meant something to this country and to the laws of Canada.”

Sentencing is scheduled for July 23. Mohan intends to read a victim impact statement in court at that time.

“I will have my day in court with him,” she said. “He will not escape me. He has escaped me for 13 years.”",[],458,0.9623136548587397

""This investigation is not trying to determine whether racism exists in B.C.'s health-care system. It does exist, just as it does in every aspect of Canadian society,"" said lead investigator Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, adding the system ""clearly needs work.""

Turpel-Lafond, who previously served as B.C.'s representative for children and youth, was called in to investigate the allegations, and delivered an update Thursday. She announced a small team has been assembled to help with the investigation into a racist game allegedly being played in B.C. emergency rooms, behaviour she described as ""egregious.""

Indigenous people are being encouraged to fill out a survey about their experiences with the health-care system, and Turpel-Lafond said a preliminary report is expected in a few months. Health-care workers who have witnessed racism are also encouraged speak out and will not face incrimination in their workplace, she said.

""This is an issue of urgent concern, this issue of racism and Indigenous-specific racism in the British Columbia health-care system,"" she said.

Those who have experienced or have knowledge of racism in the health-care system can share their information over the phone at 1-888-600-3078 or addressing_racism@gov.bc.ca.

While not everyone will feel comfortable coming forward to share their stories, Turpel-Lafond said everyone who comes forward will be treated with ""utmost confidence and respect.""

""I want to assure all Indigenous people that you are safe to share the story with myself, my team,"" she said, adding that it is independent from government and there will be no retaliation for people who speak out.

The investigative team will include people with clinical experience and knowledge of the health-care system, including former provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall. Members will also include those with experience in conducting complex investigations and data analysis.

""But it's also very important to note that in all of those areas, there are Indigenous people on my team, and they're Indigenous professionals,"" she said. ""And that's important because safety and trust—to be able to work in this space—is a precondition.""

The investigation will look at the specific allegations around the racist game, but will also examine issues around systemic racism in B.C.'s health-care system.

""I think it is very important to send a clear message that this is not a healthy and appropriate way to behave,"" she said.

On June 19, B.C.'s health minister told the public he was made aware of allegations that health-care workers were guessing the blood-alcohol levels of patients, particularly Indigenous ones.

Health Minister Adrian Dix did not identify the hospital or health authority allegedly involved, but indicated the game may have been played at multiple emergency rooms.

He said he first heard the allegation from Deputy Health Minister Steve Brown who received information about the guessing game from both the community and ""inside the system.""

After the allegations were revealed, multiple Indigenous organizations – including Métis Nation B.C. and the BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres – called on the province to hold a public inquiry into Indigenous-specific racism in B.C.

An employee at the Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy confirmed to CTV News that Kyle Ledingham was employed as of Monday, even as the company removed a posting on its website that said Ledingham ""has taught our youngest juniors, to teenagers, adults and senior players.""

On Wednesday, when CTV News visited the course to find out more, officials there didn't answer whether Ledingham was teaching teenagers.

On Thursday, Devin Sharma, the interim chief administrative officer of the Musqueam Band, said that Ledingham had been an independent contractor at Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy since 2017.

“Effective July 5, 2020, Mr. Ledingham’s services have been suspended while this investigation is ongoing,” he said in an e-mailed statement.

“Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy strives to create a safe and welcoming environment for every individual visiting our facility, including staff and players, and have offered our full co-operation to authorities investigating this matter,” he said.

Ledingham has not been charged. His lawyer says he is innocent, and if charged vows to defend him vigorously in court.

The Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy was one place the 17-year-old student said Ledingham drove her to, and while in the car, she said, she was propositioned for oral sex.

The student says she was sexually assaulted on four different times in the band room at Prince of Wales Secondary School.

Ledingham's teaching licence is on hold with his agreement, pending an investigation into his conduct. The Vancouver Police Department concluded its investigation into the claims and handed a report to Crown counsel in December. Crown prosecutors are now weighing whether to lay charges in the case.

""He teaches in many environments where there are kids and vulnerable students and that isn't right,"" the student told CTV News in an interview.

Prince of Wales school was the base of the Quest Program, where teacher Tom Ellison was convicted in 2006 of abusing several students while on trips with them in the 1970s. Concerns about his behaviour were ignored for years, according to news reports at the time.

The student says she also spent time with Ledingham alone, during a community service placement with him.

The Vancouver School District says there were almost 1,800 students registered in community service programs across the district. Supporters say it provides students with valuable learning and volunteer opportunities.

But some critics are calling for that program to be reviewed.

""Men need to be supervised in a lot of cases especially when it is one-on-one,"" said Karla Djini of Vancouver Rape Relief.

She said it's probably an overreaction to ban one-on-one time between students and teachers. But she said it makes sense to reduce it, and try to include even another student where possible.

""Having even just another person there would be a reasonable thing to try,"" Djini said.

The district says it has changed multiple policies since Ellison was convicted, saying it reported allegations against Ledingham to provincial regulators as soon as it heard of the situation.

The public didn't hear about the concerns, and it's not clear whether the Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy was informed.

Two other B.C. teachers were disciplined in the past week for having sexual contact with students. The first was with an 18-year-old graduate the teacher had taught for two years. The same teacher also gave alcohol to a 17-year-old former student before initiating contact.

The second teacher taught a student in Grades 10, 11, and 12, spending a ""significant"" amount of time with her outside school hours. The consent agreement says the relationship began the following September.

Both teachers were barred from teaching for 15 years. Their names are not published, as is customary, as the regulatory body says it feels publicizing their names could harm the students involved in the cases.",[],641,0.8323174142074822

Soon, the owlets were ready to emerge from the nest and stretch their wings, Lavoie said. The father owl would start hooting, a signal to the young owls it was relatively safe to come out of their nest. First, they would fly just a short distance, with Mom by their side. A few weeks later, Lavoie observed them flying to a tree a bit farther away.

""The owlets stuck together, always flying to the same tree as one another,"" Lavoie said. ""They often snuggled up to one another, possibly to stay warm and safe.""

As the owlets have practised flying, they've also learned to hunt, he said.

We’re sitting outside on our back patio, drinking a beer (for him) and tea (for me), while watching the sunset together. 'Monday' is a secret-code we have in our home because that’s the day we have scheduled for just the two of us.

To make it a bit more clear: Monday is the day we have scheduled for sex.

""But when my husband gently reminds me that it’s Monday tomorrow, I know he’s also asking me if 'Monday' is still happening.""

Obviously scheduling sex doesn’t sound very sexy. But when do we have the time to be together? My husband works full-time, while I attempt to re-enter the freelance field as my industry crashes and burns, all during a pandemic. To top it off, we have three young kids, a dog and a house to take care of. Scheduling sex is the only way it’s going to happen. Even without the pandemic, having a set schedule when you’ve been married a decade is a great solution — at least, it has been for us.

But lately even the appointment in my calendar hasn’t been enough for me to actually “attend” my meeting, if you catch my drift. I’m exhausted, overwhelmed and honestly there are days when that’s the last thing on my mind. But when my husband gently reminds me that it’s Monday tomorrow, I know he’s also asking me if 'Monday' is still happening.

I’ll be honest and say that I haven’t been interested in 'Mondaying' every single week since we started self-isolating in March. And I’ve accepted that it’s OK, and so has my partner. That’s the key to consent — just because we have a scheduled time doesn’t mean we’re obligated to show up. If one of us isn’t interested we respect each other. Other times, we 'Monday' — just not on Monday.

For us, having time to ourselves as a couple has been a key to not losing each other during this really challenging time. We’re constantly interacting with each other, and it’s easy to get sick of someone when you’re always around them. Still, we don’t want to lose the tenderness, the love or the connection we have with one another.

The pandemic has taught this mom that parenthood will never be easy. Read that POV here.

After the kids go to bed, we try to take some time to ourselves separately. My husband might play the guitar while I read, or I might walk the dog while he works on a home renovation project. But we always try to make time to be together. Some nights we’ll play Boggle or Yahtzee, or watch a show on Netflix or Apple TV+. Other nights we’ll retreat to bed and cuddle and talk about our day. What I’ve learned is the greater our connection to each other, the stronger our desire for intimacy.

What works for us won’t work for everyone, but we’ve learned that mutual respect and a desire to show up and love each other — even when we don’t feel like it — usually leads to a stronger desire to make time for sexual intimacy. We focus on the connection first, and the intimacy follows. On Mondays, or sometimes if we’re lucky, on a different day of the week.",[],549,0.9426364428838673
