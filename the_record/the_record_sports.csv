The Waterloo athlete achieved her dream of playing professional soccer this past season when she landed a gig with FF USV Jena, a club on Germany’s top women’s circuit. “It was a very eye-opening experience,” said the Bluevale Collegiate Institute graduate. “It was cool to see something that was my passion become my profession.” But Karn only got a taste of the top level. An injury sustained in training limited her to just three games. When she was nearing a return, the COVID-19 pandemic hit. “My whole season was a little bit chaotic,” she said. “It wasn’t the first professional season that I wanted to have but it motivated me even more to have a better season this year.” And that will likely be on a different team, after Jena was relegated to the second division in Germany. Karn’s agent is currently scouring top women’s leagues abroad to find her next job. Once travelling restrictions ease up, she expects to head overseas to resume her kicking career. “I’m hoping to stay in the first division in whatever country I go to,” she said. “That’s the goal.” And Karn is used to achieving her goals. Besides playing soccer, she’s also a professional dancer after honing her craft at studios in Kitchener (Bojangles Dance Arts) and Bolton (Joanne Chapman School Of Dance). She starred in her first music video alongside pop star Shawn Desman when she was just 14 and has danced in TV shows and the Much Music Video Awards, among other things. When she wasn’t dancing, she was using her fancy footwork on the soccer field as a standout at Wilfrid Laurier University and the semi-pro Kitchener-Waterloo United FC. Through it all, Karn got a degree in kinesiology from Laurier and a master’s degree in human health and nutritional sciences from the University of Guelph. She also waits tables at Vita Lounge and Bistro, Kitchener’s new Italian hot-spot. And she’s only 24. “I’m someone that is productive when I’m busy,” she said. Soccer has always been a big part of the Karn household. Dad Dennis played in his younger days and the clan’s German roots meant the black, red and gold flag was waved when the World Cup was on TV. So, playing in her ancestral home was a huge honour. Getting there took some work. It started with Karn landing a training stint with Bristol City in England’s top women’s league for two summers while at Laurier. From there, she went to Frankfurt for more practise. A coach from that squad ended up running Jena and offered her a job last July. “I want people to know that if you put your mind to it and put in enough work, regardless of what you want to do, it’s possible,” said Karn, who credits her dad, mom, Shelley, and sister, Tanya, for helping her achieve her soccer dream. “I want to motivate girls from Canada and Waterloo Region so that they know it’s actually possible.” One day, Karn wants to crack the national women’s soccer squad. For now, she continues to train locally with a former Laurier teammate, workout from home and tend tables while waiting for the call to her next stop in soccer."

The Waterloo native, a six-foot-seven middle blocker and occasional right-side hitter with the Kitchener Waterloo Predators Volleyball Club, has been awarded a roster spot for virtual training sessions with Canada’s Under-19 men’s team. The program, according to a news release, aims to further connect, educate and continue the development of select athletes as Canada looks ahead to world championship qualification in 2021. Thirty players will take part in the U19 virtual camp and Schoenherr, a three-time Team Ontario selection, is one of 11 players to hail from this province and the only one from Waterloo Region. The soon-to-be Grade 12 student at Bluevale Collegiate has mixed feelings about his initial foray into Team Canada territory.  “It’s obviously not what I was expecting for my first national team experience but it’s pretty surreal to be up there with the top athletes in a country that is sending a team to the Olympics next year,” said the 17-year-old Schoenherr. “Unfortunately, the (U19) team was supposed to be going to Colorado and then Honduras, but that’s not going to happen because of COVID. It might eventually happen, maybe they’ll push it back a year, I really don’t know.” The virtual camp runs Monday through Friday of next week and participants will attend two sessions daily. After a weeklong break, the camp resumes July 27 for another week of a two-a-day video gatherings. The fact Schoenherr views the camp as a learning opportunity will come as no surprise to anyone who has seen him go about his business with the Predators. He played on two teams for the club last season — U16 Ubuntu and U18 Chaos — and excelled with both while paying attention to details that could make him a better player. “He is just an absolutely fabulous human being, teammate, competitor, leader, you name it. I can’t say enough good things about this kid,” said U18 Chaos coach Duncan Cairns. “He keeps a notebook that he writes down all of the things that he’s trying to work on and accomplish. He’s very attentive to detail in terms of fixing minutiae when it comes to his arm swing or his approach angles. He asks everybody in the gym for advice and help, but he’s discerning enough to know who to listen to and who not to listen to.” Schoenherr hasn’t been on a volleyball court since March when the pandemic hit and caused the cancellation of a trip to Poland as part of a Team Ontario Elite (17-18) team that had been selected in January.  Since then, he’s played a bit of beach volleyball while finding various ways to stay fit. “It’s safe to say this is the longest I’ve gone without playing since I started to play volleyball (at age 14),” he said. “The national team is training again in Gatineau (Que.) but we’re still waiting in Ontario.” Schoenherr has aspirations of playing volleyball at the university level in the fall of 2021 and down the road hopes to achieve the loftiest of goals by playing for Canada’s senior men’s team. Cairns is optimistic he’ll do both. “He could throw a dart at a map of North America right now and he could go to any school he wants ... and he has the marks to do it as well,” Cairns said. “He could be an international sensation for us.” Schoenherr is a well-rounded athlete who has played many other sports during his time at Bluevale, including hockey, basketball, badminton and track and field in discus, shot put, javelin and long jump. He won an Ontario Federation of School Athletics Association bronze medal in the discus in his Grade 9 year."

Police contacted the London-area resident after he posted a 15-minute video last month on Instagram alleging an older teammate pressured him to use cocaine in 2016 at a nonsanctioned team party during his rookie season. After talking with Guest, officers were told he did not want to proceed with a criminal investigation. Guest has since posted a new eight-minute video on Instagram where he made additional hazing allegations and continued to detail a toxic hockey culture. The 20-year-old said he’s making his experiences public in hopes that other players won’t have to go through similar things. “For me, if I would have known what I was going to go through to try and play in the NHL … I think I would have chose a different sport to play,” he said. “It’s sad because I gave my entire life to hockey.” The Ontario Hockey League is investigating his claims and, like the Rangers, refusing to comment while the review is ongoing. In the latest video, Guest recounts how he was suspended for five games for verbal abuse in a game against the Sudbury Wolves in 2016. The Record has since learned that he made a derogatory comment toward Jewish player David Levin. According to Guest, about a week later at practice a Rangers coach used a racial slur while talking about his time playing in the National Hockey League. “This coach was proud of, like, his wittiness,” said Guest, in the video. “For me, I’m just sitting there and I’m like, ‘What do I do?’ This is my coach that has just said this to me and … what am I supposed to do there?” Head coach Jay McKee and assistant Matthew Barnaby were the only Kitchener bench bosses with NHL experience during the 2016-17 season. McKee, when reached after Guest’s first video was posted, said he did not want to comment on any allegations while they were being investigated by the league. Barnaby addressed the situation on Twitter by posting: “I don’t usually respond to these bc (because) they are ludicrous but speculation that I used the N word is completely false.” Guest, who has openly talked about dealing with mental health issues, also said that he was mocked by a coach while taking medication, though it’s unclear if he’s referring to his time with the Rangers or last season which he split between the Caledonia Corvairs and London Nationals in the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League. “I was on medication because, like, (I was) trying to figure out what’s going on with me, trying to get better,” he said in the video. “I was pretty fat. I was on this team and the coach … he’d just call me fat. There was one time I was sitting in the dressing room and I was sitting there, listening to him talk and he goes ‘Guesty, are your meds kicking in?’ And he says this in front of the whole team just to like, I don’t know, belittle me.” Former NHL player Daniel Carcillo is currently at the forefront of a class-action lawsuit against the Canadian Hockey League after outlining a list of disturbing hazing allegations he said he endured while playing for the Ontario Hockey League’s Sarnia Sting in the early 2000s. But Guest says, in his video, that hazing still exists today, adding that rookies have allegedly been forced to slow dance while naked and wear dresses and makeup, among other things. “With hazing it’s, I don’t know, it’s still happening,” he said. “It’s just that kids are hiding it, kids aren’t telling people about it, but it’s happening. And it’s like some disturbing, gross, bad stuff going on.” Guest also alleged he wasn’t allowed to use the bathroom on the bus during road trips with the Rangers. “I would go to the back of the bus and say I need to go to the bathroom and the vets wouldn’t let me,” he said. “These are like hours on the bus and I wasn’t allowed to go to the bathroom.” The Rangers were contacted by The Record after both videos were released but the organization is firm in its stance to withhold comment until the investigation into the hazing allegations wraps up. The Record has also contacted Guest, but he said he wants to do his talking through social media. Guest was a third-round draft pick by the Rangers in 2016 and played parts of three seasons with the club before returning home for personal reasons."

He fits the plan. And he’s interested in playing in the Ontario Hockey League next season. So, the Kitchener Rangers didn’t hesitate to grab Czech goalie Pavel Cajan with the 41st pick in Tuesday’s Canadian Hockey League import draft. “It’s never easy because you’re not scouting him all year and it’s limited to a certain extent,” said Rangers coach and general manager Mike McKenzie. “But we were pretty happy to select him. We think he can be a good goalie in our league.” Kitchener originally had the 49th pick but moved up eight spots due to other teams passing. CHL clubs are allowed to dress two import players and the keeper joins Finnish defenceman Ville Ottavainen to fill the Rangers’ quota. Cajan, who turns 18 in October, is the first goalie Kitchener has ever selected in the import draft. The six-foot-two, 174-pounder came up through Liberec Bili Tygri’s system and played for the Czech Under-18 squad where he posted a 1.55 goals against average and .917 save percentage in three games. “He’s got a little bit of everything,” said McKenzie. “He’s a good-size kid, is pretty quick, has good reflexes and is athletic, but he’s not a guy that plays out of control. He’s calm that way. He fit what we look for in a goalie.” The Rangers knew Cajan was eager to join the OHL this season and the goalie confirmed it in a post-draft conversation with the club.  His addition also clarifies the team’s plan in net. “We’re big believers that you don’t see the best in goaltenders until their last year or two in the league,” said McKenzie. “We wanted to find a guy that wasn’t too young but also one that wouldn’t just be here for one season and be gone.” The starting job still has to be won but Cajan looks to be the main man for the next two years before passing the baton to 15-year-old Jackson Parsons, who was a third-round pick in this year’s OHL draft. Veteran Lucas Pfeil is also eligible to return for his overage campaign. “We think pretty highly of Jackson Parsons,” said McKenzie. “But we also want to make sure that we’re giving him a chance to be successful and not putting him in a situation where he doesn’t feel comfortable. We want to bring him along at the proper pace to keep his confidence high. “The age gap fits well with what we’re trying to do with where our team is at this year and where we think it will be at after this year as well.” The Rangers passed with their second selection in Tuesday’s draft. Ottavainen signed a deal with Oulun Karpat in the Finnish professional hockey league this past April but the Rangers were told by his agent that his plan is to return to Kitchener. The big Finn was the team’s first-round pick (35th overall) in last year’s import draft and finished with 15 points in 53 games. The Rangers selected defenceman, and Arizona Coyotes prospect, Axel Bergkvist in the second round of last year’s import draft. Bergkvist has since turned pro with BIK Karlskoga, a team in the Allsvenskan, which is the second highest level of hockey in Sweden. North Bay had the first overall pick in Tuesday’s two-round online draft and took Russian winger Matvei Petrov. In all, 66 players were selected from 10 countries."

The panel, which was unanimously agreed to by the CHL’s board of directors on Thursday, will also examine the allegation that players don’t feel comfortable reporting such incidents. The announcement comes in the wake of a series of allegations of abuse made by former players, including ex-Kitchener Rangers forward Eric Guest, who said he was pressured to use cocaine by an older teammate at a party during his rookie season in 2016. Former NHL player Daniel Carcillo is also at the forefront of a class-action lawsuit against the CHL after outlining a list of disturbing allegations he said he endured while playing for the Sarnia Sting in the early 2000s. The lawsuit alleges rookies were forced to sit in the middle of the dressing room shower naked while older players urinated on them, had their bare buttocks hit with a goalie stick, were forced to strip naked and crammed in a bus bathroom and had to bob for apples in a cooler filled with urine and saliva, among other things. “We are deeply troubled by the allegations in the recently announced class action, many of which are historic in nature and we believe are not indicative of the leading experience our players receive in the CHL today,” the statement said. “Regardless of the timing, we are taking the claims very seriously as the protection of our players has been and will always be our primary concern.” The CHL plans to appoint a chair to the panel in the weeks ahead and to have “a review process” completed by the beginning of next season. “We welcome the findings of the independent review panel to ensure we are providing the safest player experience in hockey and amateur sport,” the statement said. The CHL oversees 1,400 junior hockey players in its three leagues — the Ontario, Quebec and Western hockey leagues. “The CHL is committed to ensuring them an environment that is Players First and free of hazing, abuse, harassment and bullying, and that provides zero tolerance for any of these behaviours,” the statement said. “To the extent that the allegations relate to criminal conduct we encourage those involved to contact the police.” Over the past two decades, the CHL has been working with groups such as the Canadian Mental Health Association, Canadian Red Cross and Respect in Sport to help deal with hazing, abuse, harassment and bullying. Currently, players are encouraged to reach out to their coach, general manager, police liaison, player liaison or governor/member or league officials, if they have any concerns about the way they are being treated."

This country’s oldest professional league, which was forced to halt its 2019-20 schedule in March because of COVID-19, has announced eight teams will participate in the 10th season that is tentatively slated to start Boxing Day. “We’ve been subject to a lot of inquiries in terms of what’s happening with our future and whether we’re coming back, so now with the economy opening up and regions moving into Phase 2, we felt it was a good time to tell our fan base that we are very much excited about coming back,” said league deputy commissioner Audley Stephenson. “Health officials are going to guide us and give us direction ... but we thought now was a good time to inspire a little confidence as we turn around as a society if you will.” Kitchener-Waterloo Titans owner Leon Martin is on the record as saying his team would return for its fifth season if the league returns from the coronavirus. Stephenson said teams in London, Sudbury, Windsor, St. John’s, Halifax, Charlottetown and Moncton will also return. A league that requires gate receipts to survive, Stephenson admits the season won’t happen without the green light from health officials to play in front of spectators. The Titans play at the Aud and last season averaged 1,587 spectators in 11 home games. A crowd of 3,766 took in the Jan. 14 school-day game against the Island Storm and a season-low 938 were in attendance two days later for a Thursday night game against the Windsor Express. Additional details will follow as they become available, said Stephenson."

One-time Waterloo Siskins coach Chris Lazary was one of three bench bosses named to the roster.

7,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/sports/rangers/opinion/2020/06/21/issues-in-junior-hockey-go-beyond-cocaine-allegation.html,Issues in junior hockey go beyond cocaine allegation,['Josh Brown'],"Mon., June 22, 2020","KITCHENER — The walls of silence are up. Which is ironic, since speaking out was one of the hurdles one-time Kitchener Rangers forward Eric Guest faced while playing in the Ontario Hockey League. And I get it.  The OHL and the Rangers are refusing to comment because there is an ongoing investigation into the alleged hazing Guest says he dealt with while playing for the Blueshirts in 2016. It would be premature for them to discuss the allegations Guest made last week in an Instagram video. When the investigation wraps up, league and Rangers officials can have their say about his claim that a veteran teammate pressured him and another youngster to use cocaine in a locked bathroom at a nonsanctioned party during his rookie season. But Guest’s 15-minute video also raised a myriad of issues that all players can relate to. Things that, regardless of the outcome of the investigation, need to be examined. Look, the Rangers run a tight ship. I’ve seen it firsthand for more than a decade. I can’t tell you how many players, parents, agents, scouts and coaches rave about the club. The team’s reputation is that solid. General manager and coach Mike McKenzie is approachable and a real student of the game. Jay McKee, who was behind the bench for Guest’s tenure, might just be the nicest and most level-headed person I’ve met in junior hockey.  They both clearly care about their players. So, I don’t think there is malice, ignorance or ego driving things on East Avenue.  But despite efforts to create an inclusive environment, there is a palpable disconnect between veterans and rookies — here and around the OHL. Guest captured the dynamic well in his video. “When you’re young in that league ... you listen to what the older guys tell you,” he said. “You don’t really have a voice.” Former Rangers defenceman Connor Hall echoed those feelings when reached last week: “As a 16-year-old you’re scared. Until you get comfortable with the guys you’re scared in the room. You don’t talk, you don’t do anything.” Guest also said he found it hard to leave home to play hockey. And he’s not alone. “Moving away from home is a big culture shock for a 16-year-old,” said Rangers alumnus Jacob Cascagnette. “I experienced that when I was 19 moving to Mississauga (after being traded by Kitchener). I know what Guest was going through (in that respect).” Guest said he “hated” his billet house during his rookie season, so much it made him cry. And while the Rangers vet and have some amazing billets, not all pairings mesh. “There have been multiple guys that have had different billets just because it wasn’t a right fit,” said ex-Rangers forward Jonathan Yantsis. “Some families want you to be a complete part of their family and go to family gatherings and stuff, whereas other people are more laid back and let you do your own thing.” But the biggest takeaway from Guest’s video is that he didn’t feel comfortable speaking to coaches, management or even his parents about some of the hardships he was going through. “I lied to my parents for years when I lived there (in Kitchener) and said like ‘Oh, I’m fine, I’m doing well, like I’m mentally OK’,” he said, in the video.  “I lied to them because I wanted to play in the NHL. When you’re in that situation you’re going to do anything you can. You’re going to bury your feelings, your thoughts and try and make that dream come true. That’s what I was doing.” He didn’t want to complain or be seen as a problem. He wanted to “fly under the radar.” That kind of pressure seems suffocating. And it’s heartbreaking to hear. While the investigation into Guest’s allegations of a cocaine incident is ongoing, his video goes deeper than illicit drugs. It speaks to larger issues that every player can relate to, some more than others. They are issues that aren’t unique to the Rangers. They likely run through every OHL club — and they need to be talked about."

But the team was thrust into the spotlight this past Monday when former forward Eric Guest shared his experiences of playing for the Ontario Hockey League club in an Instagram video. In it, the 20-year-old made some serious allegations. The story continues to evolve. What are the allegations? The biggest one is that an unnamed NHL-drafted player told Guest and another young player at a team party to join him in the bathroom where he locked the door and pressured them to do cocaine. “He locks the door and … he said you guys aren’t leaving this bathroom until you do this. He said you’re not leaving the bathroom until you do cocaine, basically is what happened,” Guest said in the video. Guest also addresses toxic masculinity in sport, a party lifestyle of drinking and drugs in junior hockey, “hating” his billet situation in Kitchener, the pressure of playing in the OHL and not being comfortable talking to coaches or management about these issues. When did it happen? The party occurred about a month into the 2016-17 season. Who is investigating? The OHL launched an investigation once it became aware of the situation and issued this statement on Tuesday: “The League became aware of Eric Guest’s accusations for the first time last evening. These allegations constitute a serious violation of OHL rules and include allegations of criminal conduct. We have reached out to Eric, requested an immediate meeting to receive the pertinent details and to initiate an investigation. Once we have spoken to Eric we will have a better understanding of the next steps.” The Rangers also released a statement on Tuesday: “The Kitchener Rangers became aware of the allegations made by Eric Guest for the first time last night. These allegations involve former players with our team and are extremely serious and potentially criminal conduct. As a result, we have contacted the Waterloo Regional Police Services. We will participate with the Commissioner and the League in their investigation. Until the investigation is complete the club will be making no further comments.” There is no indication how long the investigation will last. It could be days or weeks. Who is Eric Guest? Guest hails from Kilworth, which is west of London. He was Kitchener’s third-round draft pick in the 2016 OHL draft (47th overall) and spent parts of three seasons with the team. He left the club in mid-February of 2019 to return home. At the time, the Rangers did not provide anymore details, out of respect for his privacy. Guest said on his Instagram video and on a podcast that he has dealt with mental health issues. Who allegedly supplied the cocaine? According to Guest, it was an NHL-drafted player. There were five on the team at the time. One of them, defenceman Connor Hall, a former Pittsburgh Penguins prospect, told The Record it was not him. Who was leading the team at the time? Former NHL defenceman Jay McKee was the head coach. He was fired last November but that decision had nothing to do with drugs, Guest or any kind of culture problem, the team said this week. McKee’s one-time teammate, Matthew Barnaby, was an assistant coach along with Jason Fortier. Mike McKenzie was an assistant coach/assistant general manager. Murray Hiebert was the GM. Barnaby and Fortier are no longer with the club. McKenzie replaced Hiebert as GM in March of 2017 and remains in that post today. Hiebert is a senior adviser and scout with the team. What has the reaction been? Some former teammates have come out in support of Guest and feel no player should ever be put in a situation like he was with the alleged cocaine incident. Others can sympathize with his concerns about billets and not being comfortable speaking up as a rookie. Players admitted they attended some parties that season but played down the insinuation that there was a party lifestyle going on. Are OHL players tested for drugs? Yes. Random, unannounced testing, under World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) guidelines, occurs throughout the season. According to the OHL’s website, a drug education and antidoping program is provided by the league and developed and administered by the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport. The program includes an annual online education program for players and staff. What is the OHL’s stance on hazing? The OHL has a zero-tolerance policy for hazing and abuse. In 2009, the league’s board of governors created the OHL Enforcement Program in an attempt to eliminate hazing and impose penalties if violations occur. Every year, players must acknowledge in writing that they understand the policy and are encouraged to talk about any concerns they have. How has the OHL dealt with hazing in the past? In 2005, the OHL fined the Windsor Spitfires $35,000 and suspended Moe Mantha one year as general manager and 40 games as coach after older players forced rookies to strip and then locked them in the bathroom of the team’s bus on the way home from an exhibition game in London. In that case, commissioner Dave Branch spent about two weeks interviewing staff and players before announcing the penalties. About two years ago, former NHLer Daniel Carcillo took to Twitter to explain his alleged hazing and bullying suffered while playing for the Sarnia Sting as a 17-year-old during the 2002-03 campaign. In it, he talked about being hit with a sawed-off paddle from a goalie stick, being made to sit on the shower floor while veterans urinated and spit chewing tobacco on or near rookies and being forced to bob for apples in a bucket filled with waste, including urine and spit. Thursday, Carcillo and former player Garrett Taylor filed a lawsuit against the Canadian Hockey League, WHL, OHL and QMJHL alleging that players aged 15 to 17 were hazed, bullied and physically, verbally and sexually harassed.

Like most teenagers, members of the Kitchener Rangers would get together once in awhile to bond. Sometimes alcohol was involved. But life outside of the Aud was not party central, former players who donned the red, white and blue say. “There wasn’t a big party atmosphere,” said 21-year-old winger Jonathan Yantsis, who played with the Rangers for the past four years. “But let’s say we did have a day off, the older guys might go out for drinks. But the younger guys would stay at home and get ready for school. “It wasn’t like we were going out every night drinking. You choose your spots when you’re older. You’re still trying to make the NHL and be a professional.” The culture surrounding the Ontario Hockey League club was questioned earlier this week when ex-winger Eric Guest posted a video on Instagram alleging an older unnamed player forced him to use cocaine when he was a rookie at a nonsanctioned team party in 2016. “So he takes me and this other kid into the bathroom,” Guest, who was 16 at the time, recounted in the video. “He locks the door and … he said you guys aren’t leaving this bathroom until you do this. He said you’re not leaving the bathroom until you do cocaine, basically is what happened.” The OHL has since launched an investigation and, along with Rangers brass, will not comment on the alleged incident, at this time. When reached, Guest, now 20, said he too did not want to comment further and would continue communication through his personal videos. Like Guest, Yantsis also joined the Rangers in 2016 but not until later in the season when he inked a deal as a free agent. “I wasn’t around for the rookie party or anything,” he said. “I don’t know what he experienced personally. For myself, I’ve never seen that or heard of that going on with our team. No one has ever pressured me or put me in a situation where that has happened. “Sure, there is some pressure to drink at a party with older guys but it’s not like they’re forcing liquor down your throat. Most teenagers are going to drink but nobody was forced into anything they were uncomfortable with, from my experience.” In his video, Guest said the teammate who had the cocaine was a drafted NHL player. There were only five players who fit that profile with the Rangers at the time. Blueliner Connor Hall, a former Pittsburgh Penguins prospect, was one of them. “It wasn’t me,” he said. “I don’t want to comment too crazy on it. Looking at the other guys, they’re all on NHL deals. It’s not going to look good on anyone until the actual name of the person who did it comes out, whether it was a drafted player or not.” In the video, Guest, who played with the Rangers from 2016-19, also said: “... It’s like a partying lifestyle almost going through junior hockey and whatnot. I’ve seen it. Drinking problems, drug problems. It’s super common.” Hall admitted players got together for parties probably “four to five times a year.” Older players, of age, would also go to bars on days off, at times. But players had to adhere to a rotating curfew, depending on the day of the week. The 22-year-old also said the reality that someone could just text Rangers general manager Mike McKenzie, or other team staff, curtailed nights out. “From my five years being there we were pretty squeaky clean outside of hockey,” said Hall. But management can’t be everywhere. Guest didn’t feel comfortable sharing his negative experiences with the team, at the time. “You can’t go to your coaches, your GMs and say this stuff is happening in the locker-room,” he said, in the video. “They just don’t know about it. But this kind of stuff happens.” Hall said he can sympathize. “I feel like it (the alleged cocaine incident) would be a tough thing to go to someone about while you’re on the team, like he said,” said Hall. “As a 16-year-old you’re scared. Until you get comfortable with the guys you’re scared in the room. You don’t talk, you don’t do anything. “But in saying that, if it hurts you that bad … and if it hurt me in the way it hurt Guesty, I’m telling someone. I’m going into Mike McKenzie’s office, whether I’m 16 or 21, and saying something.” Jacob Cascagnette played parts of four seasons with the Rangers, before moving on to stints with the Mississauga Steelheads and Ottawa 67’s. He was at the party in question, but didn’t see any cocaine or hear about the story until this week. “I treated the rookies with respect and the rookies treated me with respect,” said the Kitchener native, who was a 19-year-old veteran at the time. “It’s just disappointing. I’m not sure who did it. I know the Rangers are a first-class organization and for something like this to happen, it shouldn’t happen in any locker-room. “My experience with off-ice stuff is that we had a close group with the Rangers each year and ... there was nothing along the lines of hazing or anything.  “But for this to happen is just sad. When the news came out it was just unbelievable. I was just embarrassed to even be a part of a roster where that happened.” Yantsis said he was close with Jay McKee, who coached the Rangers from 2016-19, and current assistants Dennis Wideman and Andreas Karlsson. “I knew I could go and talk to them if I had any problems,” he said. “I could go in there and talk about the stress of playing or if I had any problems at home that I needed to talk about. Personally, I had a great experience there (in Kitchener). There are people that are going to take care of you and care about you.”"

The Ontario Hockey League club is looking to make a more impactful stamp on the community through a new venture dubbed Rangers Reach. The independent nonprofit organization will run at arm’s length of the team and look after the community support and donations previously managed by the franchise. The break allows the Rangers to focus on hockey while Rangers Reach can take care of all the goodwill the team has done for decades. “The amount of community appearances and other things that are happening pulls people away … from making sure that the hockey business is growing,” said Rangers Reach executive director Craig Campbell. “So they decided it was time to have someone to manage their community giving portion.” Since 2002, the Rangers have allocated more than $15 million to sports scholarships, facility upgrades, ticketing programs, kids sports and several community groups such as the YMCA and KidsAbility, among others. The team distributed $467,000 to charities alone in the 2019 fiscal year. And that generosity will continue with Rangers Reach. The group immediately takes over two prominent initiatives in the annual Remembrance Day sweater auction and the community ticket initiative. The latter, which was quietly rolled out last season, gave tickets to social agencies, such as the House of Friendship, so they could treat their staff, volunteers and users to a night out. Rangers Reach will also co-ordinate the team’s monetary donations to various local groups. A grant committee will review and fulfil donation requests. Campbell is the sole paid part-time staff while the board of directors is made up of three community staples in chair Tim Jackson (president and chief executive officer of Shad Canada), Lynne Short (vice president of the Kitchener Waterloo Community Foundation) and Kelly McManus (senior director, community relations and events at the University of Waterloo). The idea for Rangers Reach was conceived by outgoing chief operating officer Steve Bienkowski, who retires at the end of the month. “I thought it was really important that we get this out before Steve steps down,” said Jackson. “To me this is all a part of Steve’s legacy. He has been committed to giving back to the community.”"

And after a stop-start pre-season due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 23-year-old from L’Ancienne-Lorette, Que., is savouring her time with New Jersey’s Sky Blue FC. “It was a special feeling, for sure,” Viens said of making her league debut off the bench against the OL Reign. “Being new in the league and just being able to play (soccer), I think it’s an amazing feeling. “But with everything (that happened), with the coronavirus, not knowing if we were even going to have a season, just being able to see soccer and play soccer with the best players in the world, it was a great feeling for me.” Sky Blue (1-1-1) faces the unbeaten North Carolina Courage on Monday at Zions Bank Stadium in Herriman. The Courage (3-0-0) have already advanced to the tournament quarterfinals as top seed. “Everyone knows how good they are,” Viens said of the Courage, who won the league title in 2018 and ‘19 and were runners-up in 2017. “But I think just being able to put a good game plan and just being able to do what we do best and play our style of soccer, we can go there and hopefully win the game.” The game could be a battle of Canadian goalkeepers, pitting North Carolina’s Stephanie Labbe against Sky Blue’s Kailen Sheridan. Sky Blue is coming off a 2-0 win Wednesday over the Houston Dash that saw Viens come off the bench in the 82nd minute. Viens entered in the 77th minute of Sky Blue’s tournament opener — a 0-0 tie June 30 with the OL Reign. She started the next game, playing the first half of Sky Blue’s 1-0 loss to the Utah Royals on July 4. Viens was taken fifth overall at the Jan. 16 NWSL draft in Baltimore. Defender-midfielder Rebecca Quinn is the only Canadian to go higher, selected third overall in 2018 by the Washington Spirit. Viens’ first crack at training camp lasted just five days because of the pandemic. She rode out the lockdown with other Sky Blue rookies before the teams returned to training. “When we came back to soccer, it was such a great feeling just being able to do our job and what we love,” she said. Viens turned heads at the University of South Florida, scoring 73 goals in 77 career games to set school and American Athletic Conference all-time records. Her 25 goals as a senior also set school and conference single-season marks. She showed time and time again that she can beat defenders and score from distance with a powerful shot. Her career 169 points and 360 shots were also school and conference records. She also set conference records for points per game (2.19), goals per game (0.95) and shots per game (4.68). Viens, a three-time all-American and 2019 Scholar all-American, was named AAC Offensive Player of the Week a conference-record six times in 2019. It’s all the more impressive given Viens’ English was limited when she started school in Florida. Former roommate Aubrey Megrath described Viens’ English as “zero.” “Every time we would talk like ‘Hey, how are you?’ every (answer) was, ‘Good.’ Anything you’d say to her, ‘Good,’” Megrath told the Tampa Bay Times. Hard work and help from the school changed that. She had not planned to go to a U.S. college but caught the eye of a USF assistant coach who saw her play while scouting a player on the opposing team. They invited her to come see the school. “One visit and I was like ‘I think the Florida’s the place for me.’ It was a great chance to develop as a person and as a soccer player. It really turned my life around.” Part of the reason Viens flew under the radar was she was not part of Quebec’s provincial team, because it would have meant leaving her family to go to Montreal. Viens was selected for Canada’s provisional roster for the CONCACAF Olympic qualifying tournament in January but did not make the final roster. She hopes she can play her way into a Canadian camp invitation. “I would like to represent my country but at the same time I just want one chance in camp, just to be able to learn from the best there and be able to compete with them. That would be a great opportunity.” North Carolina defeated Sky Blue 3-2 when they met in the 2019 regular-season finale."

Specifics are in short supply as Emily Penney looks ahead to her freshman campaign as a student-athlete at Oakland University in Auburn Hills, Mich. Penney accepted a scholarship last fall to compete for the Golden Grizzlies soccer team and is now waiting for word from head coach Juan Pablo Favero on whether the season will transpire. The uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is unfamiliar territory for the 17-year-old Penney, a soon-to-be Galt Collegiate graduate who has played competitive soccer for more than a decade and is excited about taking the next step to an NCAA Division 1 program. “We might not even be able to move in on our original report date because we don’t know what’s happening with this thing,” said Penney, a personable honour-roll student. “I don’t know anything yet and the coach doesn’t know anything yet, but, when he does, I will be one of the first to know, especially with me being an international student.” Penney, a technically gifted midfielder, made an impression on Favero at a one-day showcase camp in December 2018 and a connection was made. The two discussed how scholarships worked during their initial meeting, stayed in touch through emails over the next few months, and Penney made a verbal agreement during a return trip to Oakland in March 2019. She signed a national letter of intent during a ceremony at her high school in November. “Emily is a strong and athletic midfield player who will add much-needed depth to our central midfield,” Favero said on Oakland’s athletic department website. “She is a ball winner and will be able to cover a lot of ground and will give us the flexibility of playing in different midfield shapes. We are superexcited to see her in our uniform.” The well-travelled Penney — she has played for rep teams in Kitchener, Cambridge, Burlington, Waterloo and, most recently, Hamilton — said she “fell in love” with the campus during her visits and was excited about the “intense, fast-paced and physical” style of play she witnessed in an exhibition game between her future team and the Michigan State University Spartans. Penney planned to play for Hamilton United’s League 1 reserve team before making her way to Oakland, but the global pandemic has changed everything. She last played an indoor game in March and has since been training on her own, juggling the ball, kicking it against a wall, dribbling through cones and setting aside plenty of time for running to stay as fit as possible. “We just got our fitness packets from the coach, so I started that for the month of June, but that’s really it,” said Penney. “It’s kind of weird. You have to push yourself a lot harder because there’s no one to compete against.” Penney has been a fierce competitor during her four years at Galt and was a key player on the basketball team that won a Waterloo County (WCSSAA) championship in October, the school’s first senior girls title in 40 years. Hopes of taking Galt’s soccer program to similar heights this spring were dashed by the pandemic, as were plans to attend an athletic banquet, graduation ceremony and senior prom. “It’s kind of sad how it ended,” she said. On the soccer pitch, Penney’s career highlight to this point took place in the summer of 2016 when the Waterloo U14 team she was playing for captured the Ontario Cup and finished third at the national championships in New Brunswick. Greater achievements, she hopes, are around the corner at Oakland. The Golden Grizzlies compete in the 10-team Horizon League and last year reached the conference semifinal. The young squad lost just three players to graduation and Penney was one of seven added during the fall signing period. Regardless of whether there’s a season or not, Penney will study health sciences in her first year of university."

The multidimensional guard, who earlier this year led the Eastwood Rebels to a second consecutive appearance at the all-Ontario (OFSAA) championship, recently accepted a full scholarship to attend Gillette College and compete for the Pronghorns in the National Junior College Athletic Association. The commitment, he hopes, will lead to an opportunity to compete for an NCAA Division 1 program. “I’ve talked a lot with (Pronghorns head coach Shawn Neary) and he’s excited to have me and I’m excited to be going. I feel like there’s going to be a place for me (on the roster) and I’m thankful to be getting a good education at the same time,” said Ujullu Obang. “The program has a history of sending point guards to D1 and that’s important too. Coach Shawn has already told me there are a few D1 coaches that are interested in me, want to see me play and see what I’m about.” The Pronghorns finished last season with a record of 26 wins and six losses and sent three players to NCAA Division 1 programs with two others possibly to follow. The season ended with a loss to Western Wyoming Community College in the Region IX semifinals. Roster turnover is the nature of the beast for two-year junior colleges, so Ujullu Obang will be given every opportunity to step in and make an immediate impact. “We’ve done very well with Canadian guys, they’ve come in here and they fit in really well,” said Neary. “Ladera’s a high-level guard, we’ve had success with bigger guards (six-foot-four) like him and I think he fits in well with the way we play. Defensively, I think he can guard multiple positions, and offensively he’s skilled, he can shoot, score and pass. He’s a good pickup for us and I think he could be a high-level player in America before it’s all done.” Ujullu Obang has been a dominant force for Eastwood the past two seasons and recently became the first player to twice win the Mike Moser Memorial Award as the most valuable player in the Waterloo County Secondary Schools Athletic Association senior boys basketball league. His athletic and unselfish style of play led to talks with Ryerson, Brock, Carleton and Windsor on this side of the border, as well as handful of junior colleges in the United States. He had talked with several Division 1 programs in his Grade 12 year, including Georgetown University, but nothing came from it and Ujullu Obang returned for a fifth year at Eastwood. “It’s a business and I didn’t let it bother me. I wasn’t a fit for whatever reason, and I kept working hard and kept moving forward,” he said. “I’m thankful for the situation I’m moving into now and I’m going to make the best of it, for sure.” Ujullu Obang has done his homework on taking the junior college route and has talked with several players who have made the transition to NCAA Division 1. Ottawa native Abdul Mohamed plays at the University of North Texas after two years at Gillette, Kitchener’s Adham Eleeda played at Northern Kentucky after stints at Trinity Valley Community College in Texas and Sheridan Community College in Wyoming, and Cambridge native Zubair Seyed will play at Dixie State in Utah after spending time at Ryerson University and Daytona State College in Florida. “I’ve talked to all those guys, they’re all my friends, and I know what to expect,” said Ujullu Obang. Born in Ethiopia, Ujullu Obang has lived in Kitchener for seven years and started playing basketball in Grade 8 at Sunnyside Public School. He has since played with the academy team at St. John’s-Kilmarnock, as well as the Waterloo Wolverines and Toronto-based Canada Elite club teams. His older brothers, Cham and Hanani, were also basketball standouts at Eastwood who went on to play in the Ontario Colleges Athletic Association. Hanani wrapped up his third season with the Fanshawe Falcons earlier this year and Cham played for the Humber Hawks and Conestoga Condors. Ujullu Obang was to have learned about his Moser victory during the WCSSAA all-star game in March, but that event was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The cancellation also prevented Ujullu Obang from winning the slam-dunk competition that he placed second in one year earlier. “It’s a huge honour to win that award twice,” said Ujullu Obang. “But I really wanted to win the dunk contest this year.”"

The Leafs are doing their best to make it all sound so normal, a camp to prepare for an expanded summer-fall Stanley Cup tournament in which teams will share hotels while locking themselves away from their families and friends. “For the most part, we’re trying to keep it as normal as possible, the routines. You have to get out of your comfort zone a little bit. Might as well get used to it,” said centre Auston Matthews. “We’re wearing masks and social distancing, but around the rink we’re kind of doing the same thing (as usual),” said winger William Nylander. “It’s almost like normal to come in and get tested,” added winger Zach Hyman. “It’s the new normal. It’s a part of the process. It’s going to be part of the Stanley Cup playoffs. You can’t avoid it.” So the players have adapted to the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic as it affects their livelihood. For now, they are being tested every second day. It will ramp up to every day come July 26, when Toronto and Edmonton will host 12 teams each. All players were also tested and cleared before training camp. The dressing room, exercise facilities and bench are frequently sanitized. Winger Andreas Johnsson and defenceman Timothy Liljegren — listed as unfit to play — were seen wearing masks as they exited the locker room to watch teammates practise. Coaches and officials involved in the scrimmage did not wear them. All players must wear a mask whenever they aren’t working out or skating. “I’ve been wearing a mask as much as I can, and you almost want to desensitize yourself to it,” said veteran centre Jason Spezza. “The more you comply with it, the more you wear it, the more normal it feels and the less of a distraction it becomes, so that’s been the message. “You have to get on board quick, and then we’re able to play hockey.” Interactions with the media, and even team officials, are more or less off limits. Media access is limited to 22, each designated an X on the floor to stand — six feet apart — at the two rinks in use at the Ford Performance Centre. Media must also answer a health questionnaire and pass a temperature check before entering, and scrums are by teleconference. No one-on-ones. Players are discouraged from doing anything that would contribute to the spread of the virus. The league is asking them not to carpool, for example, and players are encouraging each other to avoid patios for dinner. And no one beyond their family (for the camp portion) and teammates should come into contact with them. They’re supposed to put their jerseys and anything else that needs laundering into a washing machine themselves, rather than a bin at the centre of the locker room. Hot tubs, saunas and steam rooms? Off limits. Showers? At home, not the rink, is preferred, and no shared towels or toiletries. Like the rest of us, they’re encouraged to wash their hands frequently, avoid handshakes, sneeze into a tissue or an elbow, and avoid anyone who might be sick. “Close contact” with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 — at a patio bar filled with strangers, for example — could sideline a player for 48 hours or more while waiting for test results. The league defines “close contact” as “15 minutes or longer at six feet or less.” The only exceptions to the distancing rule are for medical or therapeutic reasons and, of course, “scrimmages that involve body contact.” The Leafs are indeed scrimmaging. On Monday, coach Sheldon Keefe staged 20-minute mini-games with shortened benches, three lines aside. On Tuesday, Keefe played his power-play lines against his penalty-killing units for 30 minutes — complete with referees enforcing the rules, while players got back to changing in the fly and spacing on the ice. Eventually, Keefe will hold a full game scrimmage. When players are asked about the big differences at camp, they don’t talk about masks and social distancing. They focus on hockey answers. “It’s different in the sense that the urgency is there to hit the ground running,” said Spezza. “There’s no kind of dipping your toe in the water and then ramping up. We have a short camp, one exhibition game and then into the playoffs (starting Aug. 2 against Columbus).” So this new normal — designed to get the Leafs and the other 21 playoff-bound teams into game shape safely — is simply part of the furniture. “Strict adherence by all participants to preventative measures, diligent hygiene practices and enhanced testing will be key,” is how the NHL put it in guidelines sent to teams prior to training camp. “I don’t know if it’s normal, but it’s something we have to deal with,” said goalie Frederik Andersen. “To give ourselves a chance at winning, small precautions like that are going to be part of it, and something we’ll have to do as a team. “Putting a Q-tip up your nose every day is not so fun, but I think (we’re doing) the best thing we can and it’s our responsibility to keep each other safe.”"

Half of the 34 players on the first day of training camp worked out at 11 a.m. on the Marlies’ ice at the Ford Performance Centre, the other half about two hours later. In between, they played three mini-scrimmages. “It was a lot of fun,” said forward Mitch Marner. “You miss being around the guys. It was great to be back out there. You want to be back in the same room together, chirping each other.” There was hockey again. “Conditioning-wise, it wasn’t great,” said star centre Auston Matthews, who was off the ice for a couple of weeks after testing positive for COVID-19 in Arizona. “It was just great to be back here, back in Toronto, back with your teammates, doing what we all love.” There were some nifty goals by Marner and Ilya Mikheyev. Some nice saves by Frederik Anderson. A classic dipsy-do from Matthews. A shootout where William Nylander was the difference. And rookie Nick Robertson, wearing No. 89, undressed Jake Muzzin to create his own scoring chance. “He’s got that dogged mentality. He’s a hard-working kid,” Marner said of Robertson, the 18-year-old winger from the OHL’s Peterborough Petes who was the team’s second-round pick last year. “He’s not afraid to get in the dirty area. His shot’s pretty amazing. He was impressive to watch.” Sheldon Keefe had as healthy a lineup as he’s seen since taking over as head coach in November, with Mikheyev and Muzzin back from injuries. Andreas Johnsson (knee) remains out. Timothy Liljegren also missed practice, deemed unfit to play with no other information available. “Mikheyev looks excellent, and Muzzin as well,” said Keefe. “Those guys really haven’t had any time off. They continued to rehab their injuries and skated all the way through for the most part. It’s exciting to see them. Obviously we still miss Andreas. He’s an important piece of our team and we’re happy that he’s making progress toward a return. It was nice to see everybody else out there, otherwise.” Keefe said he designed the day to push the players’ conditioning. He expected things to get sloppy as the day went on. “We were trying to make the conditions difficult out there for the players,” said Keefe. “We had some important things we wanted to get accomplished in terms of our structure and our system. The parameters we set out — practising with just three lines, scrimmaging with just two lines — we wanted to make it difficult from a conditioning standpoint, so the overall pace of play went down as a result. That’s what I designed. They pushed through it.” They were tired at the end. “We’re all happy to be back at work,” said defenceman Morgan Rielly. “It’s a bit different in terms of some protocols, but as players we’re willing to do whatever it takes. The attitude is good. We’re excited to be back, to hang out together. “The main focus is to compete for a championship, but you’ve got to start somewhere.”"

Dr. Howard Njoo said Tuesday that discussions are ongoing between the Canadian government and the Major League Baseball team, but he said the issue of having both the Blue Jays and American-based teams continually crossing the U.S.-Canada border complicates the idea of hosting regular-season games. Njoo said the federal, Ontario and Toronto governments were comfortable with the measures the Blue Jays put in place to safely train as a team at the Rogers Centre. However, on the issue of crossing the border, he said Canada is in a different place than the U.S. with regards to COVID-19. “The issue of the regular season, I think, I was speaking to the potential of travel across the U.S.-Canadian border, not just the Blue Jays leaving town and coming back after a road trip but also for teams coming in, that also is obviously a totally different ball game,” Njoo said. “Those discussions are ongoing, but what I would say and you can certainly look at the data, is that the situation in Canada and the U.S. I would say from a pure epidemiological point of view is vastly different.” Njoo said while Canada typically records around 300 new COVID-19 cases daily, the United States records over 60,000 cases per day. “And certainly the situation doesn’t appear to be changing quickly in the U.S.,” he added. The Jays have stated their preference is to play at the Rogers Centre. Alternatives mentioned have been TD Ballpark in Dunedin Fla., in the middle of a coronavirus hot spot, or Sahlen Field in Buffalo, N.Y., which is not considered up to major-league standards. Dunedin is the Blue Jays’ spring-training site, while Buffalo is home to the Blue Jays’ triple-A affiliate. Njoo said even if teams visiting Toronto adhere to the same standards and protocols, the issue remains that the Blue Jays will be heading into the U.S. for road trips and coming back over the border. “If (visiting teams) do come to Canada and there’s a very tight quarantine bubble, they don’t leave the hotel and just go to the games, that’s one aspect,” he said. “But I can appreciate for the Blue Jays, for the players, that’s tough because they’ve had this very tight quarantine and work bubble for spring training here in Canada. But if they were to leave Canada and go on a road trip, it’s hard to look at all the factors involved in terms of what the risk might be for themselves leaving Canada and then coming back. “So there are lots of factors in play, and I can’t pretend to know all of the possibilities and things that need to be looked at, but that’s certainly I think a major issue in terms of travel back and forth across the U.S. border.” The Blue Jays’ season opener is July 24 at Tampa Bay. The home opener is July 29 against Washington. The 2020 season has 60 games, down from the usual 162."

The club’s career leader in games played, hits and triples, Fernandez died on Feb. 16 at age 57. The 1993 World Series winner and five-time all-star had battled kidney problems for several years. He was first hospitalized with polycystic kidney disease in 2017. Signed by the Blue Jays in 1979, the Dominican native played 12 seasons over four stints with the club. Fernandez hit .333 with nine runs batted in during the Blue Jays’ 1993 six-game World Series win over the Philadelphia Phillies. Fernandez’s name was placed on the Blue Jays’ Level of Excellence at Rogers Centre in 2001. “There are few players in the game who can impact a team and a fan base the way Tony did in Toronto,” Blue Jays president/CEO Mark Shapiro said in a statement. “Beyond his impressive career numbers, achievements, and accolades, Tony resonated with baseball fans because of how he played the game and conducted himself as a teammate. To wear a patch in his memory is to honour his exceptional life on behalf of Blue Jays fans across the country.”"

At least it certainly sounds that way, via Blue Jays skipper Charlie Montoyo, who disclosed Anderson’s injury to reporters on Sunday. But of course the manager doesn’t like to go anywhere near the whither-Nate question, no more so at summer training camp than four months ago at spring training camp, when the flame-throwing right-hander had observers drooling over his 100-m.p.h. heat. So, Anderson’s ailment apparently doesn’t open the door for Pearson to push his six-foot-six frame through it and into a Major League Baseball debut by the end of July. Ditto, a renaissance for the chronically elbow-stricken Ryan Borucki, also trying to crack the starting rotation. And nah, perish the thought that Pearson is being held back to manipulate his service time. Even though the gem of a pitching prospect only needs to spend just over a week off the major league roster for the club to secure an additional year of team control in 2026 — under the format prorated over a 66-day season. Montoyo claims he’ll leave that slot a pending thing, determined by how the arms show over the remaining 12 days of camp, should Anderson not be ready by the time the 60-game season launches for the Jays on July 24 in St. Pete’s versus the Tampa Bay Rays. “I love the fact all of the guys know they are competing,” said Montoyo. “We’re building them all, so they’re all going to have a chance to compete. We’ll see where we go a week and a half from now.” Anderson, said Montoyo, suffered the injury a couple of days ago. Up to a three- or four-inning pitching capacity at the moment, he may not be ready to take the starting ball out of the chute. Obliques can be touchy. The 32-year-old was acquired from Milwaukee in the off-season. In 32 games with the Brewers last year, he had an 8-4 record with a 4.21 ERA and 124 strikeouts over 139 innings. UP TO SPEED Trent Thornton was privileged to be given two keys back home during the pandemic break that cleaved a continental divide between spring and summer training camp. The first came from a buddy who turned over the key to the locked-down gym he owned, allowing Thornton to work out on the premises quarantine-alone. The second came from his old high school coach, allowed Thornton to use the playing field with one (1) other person. So, as baseball paralysis goes, Thornton could hardly ask for much more. “I feel great,” said the 26-year-old, who became an unlikely anchor in Toronto’s shredded starting rotation last year, his rookie season. “Threw the entire time I was home, so I really don’t think I missed a beat at all. With another week or two, I feel like I could just let the reins off.” The right-hander threw some 50 to 60 pitches in Sunday’s live BP session — no intrasquad game on this evening — and liked what he saw of himself, with an emphasis on the elevated fastball. With one MLB season under his belt, he’s also had a bellyful of big-league hitters at the plate, at least to the point that he no longer feels intimidated. The objective for this manic-paced 60-game schedule: “Just getting outs quick, going deeper into games, not trying to strike everyone out.” Because last year that often had him in situations where he threw upward of 100 pitches in a mere five innings. The native of Charlotte, N.C. was, back in March, presumed to be Toronto’s fifth starter, though there’s stiff competition for the job. “I want to be in the rotation as much as anybody, but you can’t take things like that for granted. I like to pitch with a chip on my shoulder. Nothing’s going to be handed to you so I just go about my business like that, just about every day.” Thornton does have one edge on his teammates. He lived all of last season at the hotel overlooking the Rogers Centre, where the team has been quarantined for this camp and may have to reside as well if the Jays are permitted to play their 2020 regular-season games in Toronto. “I know some guys aren’t ecstatic about him. But I did it all last year. It’s definitely doable. “It does get a little boring sometimes. But if that’s what we need to do to play, that’s perfectly fine by me.”"

Now we know,['Chris BumbacaUSA Today'],"Tue., July 14, 2020","It’s been an eventful off-season for Patrick Mahomes. The Super Bowl MVP recounted his life over the past few months — the post-season obligations, buying a new house, confronting a pandemic, supporting countrywide protests and signing a record-breaking contract worth up to $503 million (U.S.) — for a GQ story and photo shoot that published Tuesday. Mahomes revealed another important detail: rapper Post Malone now has the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback’s signature tattooed on his body. The 24-year-old told the magazine he and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce went backstage at Malone’s show in Kansas City. A few (several) games of beer pong later, Malone bet the duo that if they won again he’d get tattoos of their names. Post Malone stuck with his word and Mahomes claims the inking took place right backstage. Here’s some more insight about Mahomes from the story: “I understand my platform,” Mahomes told GQ. “I understand that my part in the video is a big part of it.” He’d spent time with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who sought his perspective. Mahomes informed the commissioner of his desire to promote voter-registration efforts and that the league should have one person dedicated to helping players tap into their community activism endeavours. “So whenever you wanna help out the community, you have someone that works with the team that can help,” Mahomes told GQ. “It was a great conversation. It lasted, like, 30 minutes to an hour.” “I’ve seen how people, on Twitter, have tweeted and said, ‘Oh, you’re not full Black,’” he told GQ. “But I’ve always just had the confidence and believed in who I am. And I’ve known that I’m Black. And I’m proud to be Black. And I’m proud to have a white mom too. I’m just proud of who I am. And I’ve always had that confidence in myself.” As the son of a former Major League Baseball player, Mahomes also is aware of his privileged upbringing. “The more I mature,” Mahomes told GQ, “I’ve learned that I was blessed to be in the situation that I was in.” “I’m nowhere near where I can be,” he told GQ."

Jackson accepted the consequences and apologized, the Eagles said. “In our many conversations with him, it has also been made clear that this is only the beginning. We have discussed a concrete plan for how he and we can heal moving forward. He understands that in order to remain on the team, he must also commit to supporting his words with actions,” the Eagles’ statement read in part. Because the Eagles are not announcing a suspension, it’s likely they have fined Jackson. Teams typically don’t announce the amount when they fine players. Jackson had initially posted a fake quote attributed to Adolf Hitler over the Fourth of July weekend. He reposted the fabricated quote on his Instagram story Monday attempting to clarify why he posted it. Following significant backlash to the posts, Jackson issued two apologies (one a video on Instagram, and one on Twitter), saying he would work to educate himself. Earlier Friday, Jackson virtually met with Edward Mosberg, a 94-year-old Holocaust survivor. “I’m taking this time to continue with educating myself and bridging the gap between different cultures, communities & religions,” Jackson wrote in his post about the meeting on Instagram. “I know he’s under the fire,” Eagles teammate Lane Johnson said of Jackson. “With everything that’s happened in the past months, I know his heart’s in a good place as far as helping the community and helping his people. Ultimately, whenever you make mistakes, you have to own up to it and I think the best thing about it now is get educated and try to make all the wrongs you did right. That’s all you can do.” “We appreciate (Jackson’s) desire to educate himself, but we all understand there is still a lot of work to be done,” the Eagles said in their statement. “We will continue to assist DeSean in this process, and we also know all of us in our organization need to listen and learn more about things that are unfamiliar or uncomfortable to us. “We must continue to fight against anti-Semitism and all forms of discrimination, while not losing sight of the important battle against systemic racism.”"

A CFL source said Friday the league is seeking roughly $42.5 million in aid. In April, it asked the federal government for up to $150 million in financial assistance in the event of a cancelled 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the league was anxious “to be accountable to taxpayers,’ and would attempt to repay a portion of government assistance through “community programs, tourism promotion, the Grey Cup, our digital channels.” The source added the new request is to cover operating costs and player salaries for a shortened 2020 season. The proposal also includes a letter of support from the CFL Players’ Association. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity because neither the government nor CFL have confirmed the request. Last month, the CFL and CFLPA began talks to amend the current collective bargaining agreement to allow for an abbreviated season. The two sides must sign off on any changes for any games to be played. But prior to the start of negotiations, the CFL presented the union with a memo outlining the conditions it wanted and a completion deadline of July 23. When asked about the revised financial request, the CFL said, “We continue discussions with the federal government including discussions on our possible return to play.” While the revision is for substantially less money, the CFL’s situation hasn’t changed much. It still requires financial assistance with revenues having dropped drastically due to the COVID-19 pandemic and expenses expected to continue to rise if it tries to play a season with no fans The CFL’s initial request of Ottawa consisted of three tiers: It called for $30 million immediately to manage the impact the outbreak has had on league business; additional assistance for an abbreviated regular season; and up to another $120 million in the event of a lost 2020 campaign. When Ambrosie spoke to a federal standing committee on finance in May, he was roundly criticized for failing to stipulate where the funds would go and not involving the CFLPA in the process. But the source said the revised proposal mirrors an authentic financial offer and contains more specific details than the original one did. The earliest an abbreviated ‘20 season will begin is September, but Ambrosie has stated a cancelled campaign also remains possible. If the CFL holds a shortened season, it’s expected to do so in a hub city. Winnipeg has been mentioned as a strong hub candidate, but the source said Regina also is under consideration."

The Raptors head coach plans to use the first two or three to get his entire roster familiar with the speed of NBA games again, with lots of players getting time on the court; the middle three or so would be to fine-tune the rotation and extend the minutes for the players Nurse will rely on in the post-season; and the last couple would be to taper a bit, calm down, try to avoid injury and get some rest for the workhorses. It makes sense, but in this nonsensical resumption to a season delayed four months, when everything is new and no one knows how it will all unfold, it may not be possible to pull off. “That would be my initial game plan, but obviously the ball goes up and everything changes, usually,” Nurse said on a conference call.  Figuring out how to use the “seeding games,” as the NBA is calling the final segment of the aborted regular season, will be a struggle for each of the 22 teams gathered near Orlando, Fla.  For 12 of those teams, the playoffs are already a guarantee and the only things to play for are seeding — starting with a doubleheader on July 30 — and game rhythm. How much seeding really matters is debatable since no team will have anything close to a “home-court advantage” on any of the three floors the NBA will use at the Disney/ESPN campus. The Raptors have a difficult schedule for the eight games left in the season. They will open against the Lakers on Aug. 1 and also face the Milwaukee Bucks, Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers, all tremendous opponents. It should give them a good indication of where they stand. “I like the schedule,” Nurse said. “I like to see the Lakers again and Milwaukee again, just to get a feel for them again. I think we’re playing really quality teams. I think every team we’ve got is a playoff team. Obviously those are quality teams. “I like it.” The players would like Nurse’s approach to ease into the final eight games with little or no pressure. None of them have played meaningful five-on-five basketball since the middle of March. “You can’t try to adjust this, that and the other. You have to have that same approach each and every game and figure it out as you go,” Raptor Norm Powell said. “It’s going to be a different feel with no fans and all of that, but the main focus is getting ourselves back to the level where we want to be and be able to compete and fight for a championship.” The Raptors are counting on their experience to get them through the most unusual circumstances, because every key member of the rotation went through 10 weeks of intense competition in the championship run of 2019.  “(The players) came here in great shape and, as soon as we got here, everyone was starting to put in work,” Serge Ibaka said. “I’ve been in the league for 11 years. You can see when people (are) locked in and they are ready mentally and when they are not. “So I can tell you right now, mentally, everybody is ready.” The Raptors, who opened camp in Orlando on Saturday after training in the Naples/Fort Myers area, were limited to small group workouts before joining the NBA bubble. It was frustrating not to have five-on-five time, but it’s not like it was going to change what the Raptors are or what they do before the games begin. It’s the same for their eight opponents: all good teams, legitimate championship contenders, staying true to themselves. “The teams that we’re going to face are probably going to be consistent toward who they were during the season,” assistant coach Adrian Griffin said. “When we play Milwaukee, you’ve got to prepare for Giannis (Antetokounmpo). He’s going to be Giannis. When we play the Lakers, LeBron (James) is going to be LeBron, Anthony Davis is going to be Anthony Davis. “We know these guys. They know us. We’ll prepare the best way we possibly can and let the chips fall where they may.”"

He is a bit prickly and something of a contrarian, not one to suffer fools gladly, and completely unwilling to bend to authority when he feels something is amiss. It makes him the perfect leader for this group of Raptors in this most unusual of NBA seasons: a veteran who questions everything that he feels needs to be questioned, someone the other players want to follow because of what he does on the court and, really, the conscience of the team. Ha arrived at the NBA’s Florida campus on the Disney grounds in excellent shape and ready to work. He showed up having played a significant role in the entire operation — from medical testing protocols to living conditions — and if he’s ready to go and content, the whole organization is ready to take its lead from him. For a team chasing a second straight championship, having the undisputed alpha male on board is immeasurably important. “I think Kyle is an incredibly smart, intelligent person, so when something isn’t quite right he’s going to bring it to your attention,” coach Nick Nurse said Monday. “I’m good with that. Listen, this is a partnership and a communication thing. It’s ‘we’ trying to get to some place. Feedback is important.” Lowry is certainly going to give it. In all matters. As a member of the players’ association competition committee, he worked with the league in setting up every facet of life for the 22 teams that are now gathered near Orlando for the resumption of the suspended season later this month. He was involved in developing testing protocols, scheduling, what is allowed and what’s not, and has made it clear to his teammates how important that is. He is the franchise’s conduit to a healthy existence. “It was interesting to come up with some of the concepts and to talk that over, and understand (not just) what we’re trying to do but how we’re trying to do it, and make sure that it’s done the right way for all the players, coaches, and it’s (as safe as) we possibly can do it,” Lowry said in his first group interview since the league suspended the season in March.  “I think that we’ve done a good job so far with the safety aspects, the health aspects. I think there’s definitely going to be some adjustments that need to be made, but that’s the one thing about our league and our professionals, is that we make adjustments on the fly and we’re able to.” So far, Lowry’s been more than pleased with how things are going and the Raptors have been more than pleased with his actions — on and off the court. They want him to lead and they need him to be the same player who helped Toronto to a championship more than a year ago. In the latter regard, they’ve never had a healthier, more rested Lowry going into the playoffs than they have now and they plan to ride him hard. “He’s just smarter in that way, and I think he’s got tremendous confidence,” Nurse said. “And I think as well he knows he’s got to be kind of a main cog, right? … You know he’s always going to play hard and make the defensive plays, but he’s got to be a main factor in the offence and he kind of carries himself that way this year a lot more.” There is an undeniable joy to the way Lowry conducts himself on the court, even if it is sometimes masked in an intensity that’s off the charts. The way he plays — taking charges and making big shots when he has to, but ceding the spotlight when that’s needed, too — rubs off on his teammates and now that he’s back among them, he’s whole again. He loved the break to spend time with his wife and two young sons at their Philadelphia home, but he’s happy to be back on the court with his peers. “You wanted to be more careful. You wanted to be in a situation where you want it to be safe, and understand that you have to be safe with your family,” he said. “But right now, it feels great to be able to get back on the basketball floor with your guys, your teammates — kind of getting the camaraderie back together and being around, and knowing that you’re about to do your job.” And safely. First and foremost, safely. “I think our protocols and our health and safety measures have been top notch. I think this thing will work perfectly,” he said. “The league, the players’ association, (have done) a phenomenal job of making sure that we’re doing everything that we can possibly do to make sure that we’re healthy, we’re safe and we’re in an environment where we can be successful and do our jobs at a high level.” And if he’s a bit thorny at times — like the four or so instances where he mocked reporters in a 13-minute conversation — that’s divorced a bit from his persona as a teammate. “I think he’s only thorny with you guys,” Nurse joked. “He is in tremendous shape. He’s practising hard, shooting the ball at an incredible rate. He looks great. I haven’t sensed the thorniness, so there you go.”"

The difference in Gasol, as least judging by photographs dotting various social media sites, is truly stark and the descriptions and observations are apt. Gasol is noticeably thinner, absolutely more muscular and apparently fitter than he’s been since he arrived in Toronto from Memphis about 18 months ago. But he’s also 35 years old and spent most of the interrupted NBA season fighting a nagging hamstring injury. No matter what the pictures look like or what his teammates and coaches say, erring on the side of caution with him these days makes the most sense. “Marc went for a good stretch of practice — the main bits — and just like I suggested, took himself out to kind of ease into it,” coach Nurse said Sunday after the Raptors’ second practice at the NBA campus on the Disney grounds just outside Orlando, Fla. “I think OG (Anunoby) did later on in the practice as well.” That’s why Gasol begged out of an expected electronic chat with the Toronto media: He’d left the practice facility well before the cameras were turned on. Nothing nefarious, Nurse said. Just a logistical issue after the player had done his work. It’s going to be that way for a handful of Raptors in the three-week period preceding the “seeding games” — starting Aug. 1 against the Los Angeles Lakers — that will signal the full resumption of the NBA season. “It’s a little similar sometimes to when you’re with the national teams. You go hard for a few days and then you might pull guys out and start sprinkling in some days off around the board, and Marc is certainly a candidate for that,” Nurse said. “Obviously I would even put Pascal (Siakam), OG, Freddy (VanVleet), Kyle (Lowry) into that group, too. Serge (Ibaka). “We’ll probably monitor it individually, but almost mandate some days off in there, again, to let their bodies kind of regroup for a full day and recharge as we get back here early.” But Gasol is the most important asset to protect because of his age and the sheer amount of basketball he’d played, for the Raptors and in Spain’s world championship run before the injuries that wrecked almost all of his 2019-20 season. He’s too valuable to the team, too integral to whatever success the Raptors will have, to overwork him now — no matter how good or healthy or thin he is. “He looks really, really good. He’s moving really well,” teammate Terence Davis II said. “He looks like Prime Marc to me, so I don’t know, man. It’s scary.” Gasol’s skills are undeniable and vital for the Raptors. The seven-footer is one of the best passing big men in the NBA — his ability to facilitate Toronto’s offence gives it an extra dimension most teams don’t have — and he is the club’s defensive anchor. Keeping him healthy, no matter what his body type is, and expanding his contribution is part of the plan in the training camp portion. “I think there’s probably some baskets in him in the fourth quarter or down the stretch (and we’ll) play a little bit inside out through him as well, because … any time we can get him the ball, good things happen,” Nurse said. “Not necessarily buckets from him, but good things happen.  “But (it’s) probably good to see if we can get his usage rate up. I’m working on it. I’m not sure it’s going to happen, but it is a thought in the forefront of what we’re doing.” Gasol will eventually spend time with the media and go through how and why he undertook this transformation so late in his career. It hasn’t been a hot topic of conversation while the Raptors have been working out in Florida, but Nurse said it has come up in casual chatter. “I did ask him about what was the key, what’d you do, and he just said: ‘Man, it was consistency,’” the coach reported. “With the situation we’ve all been in in the last four months, you take out the games and all the long road trips and the late-night flights, and all the things that factor into making fitness and nutrition a little harder … and he just said it was a consistent rhythm: eating at the same time every day and eating very healthy, obviously, and all that stuff.”"

He found at it Muirfield Village, and suddenly looks as though he’ll be tough to catch at the Workday Charity Open. Morikawa ran off four straight birdies after making the turn Friday, finished with another birdie and shot 6-under 66 to build a four-shot lead over Sam Burns (66) in the storm-delayed tournament. His 13-under 131 was one shot off the course record set by Jason Dufner in 2017 at the Memorial. The Workday Charity Open, which replaces the cancelled John Deere Classic for this year only, has been set up a little easier than it will be for the Memorial next year, with slightly slower greens and rough that isn’t quite as high or thick. Morikawa is still playing a different brand of golf than anyone else. Through two rounds, he has 15 birdies and an eagle. His four bogeys have come from silly mistakes that are bound to happen. Ian Poulter, back at Muirfield Village for the first time since 2009 because of a reconfigured schedule brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, had a 69 and joined Chase Seiffert (69) at 7-under 137. The second round had a pair of 75-minute delays because of the rumbling thunder and lightning that seems to appear whenever the PGA Tour is at Muirfield Village. “Who knows who’s going to take it deep today?” Morikawa said. “Whether I have the lead or not, I’ve got to go into the weekend feeling like I’ve got to make the same amount of birdies I have the past two days. I feel like there’s a lot of birdies out there for me especially, the way I’ve been hitting it.” Morikawa, who turned pro just over a year ago after graduating from Cal, is making his debut at the course Jack Nicklaus built, and perhaps it’s no coincidence that Nicklaus was famous for hitting a cut. “I had heard from a lot of people before, this course was going to suit a left-to-right shot, anyway,” Morikawa said. “Obviously, Jack hit that, and I think it does. But I’ve been able to leave myself some really good numbers into approach shots. I’ve been keeping myself in the fairway for the most part, and that obviously helps.” Among those playing in the afternoon, Jon Rahm and Brooks Koepka first had to worry about making the cut after sluggish starts. Koepka started at 2 over. Rahm was at even par. Phil Mickelson had another exciting day, minus the meltdown at the end of his round. He opened by chipping in for birdie and making a 12-foot eagle putt. With the tee moved forward on the 14th hole, the par 4 guarded by a pond right of the green, he hit driver to 10 feet and had to settle for birdie. And right before the first batch of storms arrived, Mickelson felt the wind shift and get stronger, so he took driver on the par-5 fifth and whaled away over the trees and just inside backyard fences. It settled in the rough, but it left him only 114 yards away and a pitching wedge to the green. The speed of the greens fooled him, and he repeatedly left putts short. Even so, he managed to post a reasonable number. Jordan Spieth wasn’t as fortunate. He took double bogey on his 17th hole, the par-3 eighth, and was likely to miss the cut. Morikawa had made 22 cuts in a row to start his pro career, a streak that ended two weeks ago at the Travelers Championship. That was three short of the streak Tiger Woods put together when he turned pro. But the 23-year-old Californian was more interested in low scores than simply getting in four rounds and a paycheque. “At the end of the day, you’re out there to win tournaments,” he said. “If you miss the cut, make it by whatever, you just want to learn from each week. And like I said, I learned a lot from those two days missing the cut than I have in a lot of events so far when I’ve been finishing whatever.” This one caused him to take a closer look at what was lacking in his game, instead of being reasonably content with a solid finish. “I think sometimes when something really doesn’t go your way, like missing a cut, it just stands out a little more,” he said. Somewhere along the way, he couldn’t rely on his cut shot, allowing him to aim some 6 yards left of his target and fade it toward the pin, no matter where it was located. It was after his practice round Wednesday that he figured out what was missing, and he went back to an old drill of sticking his glove under his left arm. It’s a rotational drill, and it paid off. He had to wait until the storms to see if anyone could catch him, with the second round not likely to end until Saturday."

Adam Hadwin of Abbotsford, B.C., posted the best score among Canadian golfers with a 6-under 66. He’s one stroke behind leader Collin Morikawa, who shot a 7-under 65. Nick Taylor, also of Abbotsford, was in a group of four golfers two shots behind back at 5 under, while Roger Sloan of Merritt, B.C., shot a 4-under 68 Thursday. He is in an 11-way tie for seventh place. Taylor is playing in his first tournament on tour since the PGA restarted last month during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hadwin, who shot his eighth consecutive round in the 60s, is coming off a tie for fourth last week at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit. Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., shot 2-under 70, while David Hearn of Brantford carded a 71. Hadwin bogeyed his first hole before reeling off seven birdies. “Even the first two weeks back, I felt like I played some pretty decent golf. I just kind of made some rusty mistakes,” Hadwin said. “I’d hit a ball out of bounds or in the water where I shouldn’t have or maybe try to get too much out of a shot, whereas I think last week it kind of came together. I was doing a lot of the similar things, but I didn’t make any of the mistakes. I felt like there were times last week where I probably could have gotten a few more shots, but I really didn’t have any risk. It was kind of a free-flowing easy-type round and just not a lot of stress. When you can do that through multiple weeks, it helps a lot.” Taylor took time off as the tour restarted to be with his eight-month-old son. “Obviously the break was great timing for a lot of reasons ... Have a bit of a cushion, take some more time off, I just really enjoyed being home, so just waiting an extra few weeks, (it) was great to be home,” Taylor said. “Yeah, I’m excited to get back out here and play, but it was nice to be home.” Correction - July 10, 2020: This article was edited from a previous version that mistakenly said Adam Hadwin posted the highest score among Canadian golfers with a 6-under 66. In fact, he posted the best score amongst Canadian golfers. "
