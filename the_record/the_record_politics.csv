Then Ottawa offered hope,['Alex BoutilierOttawa Bureau'],"Tue., July 14, 2020","OTTAWA—Like charitable organizations across Canada, WE Charity was hit hard by COVID-19. Morale within the organization had been low for weeks, with long-time staff members being shown the door as the global health crisis deepened. Then news started circulating within the organization of a significant federal government contract. The Liberal government’s $19.5-million deal for WE to operate a $900 million student volunteering grant program turned the mood around, a source within the organization told the Star. “It was a really demoralized space for quite a while, and then we started hearing whispers internally about a government contract, a government project,” the source said. The Star agreed not to name the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. A second source corroborated their account. “They started presenting it internally before the documents were ever signed, the contract was ever finalized, because that’s the way WE works. So we started drawing up the program before it was assured, before it was guaranteed. We started hiring people back based on that.” The mood within the organization is markedly different today, the source said, now that the international charity finds itself at the centre of a political scandal. Over the past week, it has been revealed WE paid members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s family to speak at WE-hosted events. Margaret Trudeau, the prime minister’s mother, received $250,000 in honorariums for speaking at 28 WE-hosted events between 2016 and 2020. Alexandre Trudeau, the prime minister’s brother, received $32,000 in speaking fees between 2017 and 2018. Then it was revealed that Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s daughter works with the organization. On Monday, Trudeau and Morneau apologized for taking part in the cabinet discussions around the awarding of the contract. The federal ethics commissioner has launched an investigation. WE laid off 450 contract workers after the federal deal was nixed. Those workers were let go after the scandal broke and the charity and the government “mutually” agreed to let the public service administer the $900-million program to pay students to volunteer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The source said WE Charity and its co-founders, brothers Marc and Craig Kielburger, are now in damage-control mode.  The charity took out full-page ads in the Star and the Globe and Mail Monday, in which the Kielburgers apologized for the scandal. The same advertisement ran in Postmedia papers Tuesday. “The charity’s integrity and purpose has been called into question,” the advertisement read. “It has had direct impacts on our staff, supporters and beneficiaries. We have made mistakes that we sincerely regret. It has led us to more closely examine our own internal structures, governance and organization.” The charity issued a statement to the Star in response to questions about the organization. “With respect to our staff’s morale, WE Charity has welcomed 2,500 current and former staff over 25 years, and we respect the voice of each individual,” the statement said.  “We strive to create an environment for all employees where they can enjoy coming to work each day.” WE is by no means alone; charitable organizations across Canada have seen a decrease in donations and revenues since the pandemic hit. According to Imagine Canada, an advocacy group for the charitable sector, 73 per cent of Canadian charities reported donations were down in May 2020. “The size and scope of (COVID-19-related) shifts is beyond anything that we have seen before, far exceeding what we saw in the 2008/2009 financial downturn,” wrote David Lasby, the organization’s director of research, in a May report. “(It’s had) broad effects (so that) even the most diversified revenue bases are seriously affected.” The Star’s source said that the Kielburgers began regular town hall meetings within the organization after the news website Canadaland in late 2018 began to investigate the charity, in an effort to increase transparency for its employees.  A frequent aspect of those internal pep talks was a financial update from Marc Kielburger. The source said that last fall, Kielburger started talking about a coming recession and the “smart moves” the charity was taking to make sure it wasn’t overextended. And then COVID happened. “It is true that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the Canadian charitable sector as a whole, and WE Charity was no exception — but to be clear, WE Charity had no risk of ceasing operations,” the emailed statement said. “Prior to WE receiving its contact, the government had recognized the challenging times for the sector, and allocated $350 million through partners including the United Way, the Red Cross and Community Foundations Canada. The contract with WE was a further step in working with charities who were co-ordinating placements for students, while also engaging post-secondary students in meaningful service. That is the sole reason we participated.” There is considerable anger within the organization’s 174-person workforce, and especially among those contract workers laid off after the scandal hit, according to people who spoke to the Star on the condition they not be named. The government contract allowed WE to rehire a number of employees the organization had laid off since the pandemic hit. One source described it as “keeping the lights on” for WE’s programming.  The Prime Minister’s Office did not immediately answer a request for comment Tuesday. "

The survey, conducted by Campaign Research for the Star, found that just 13 per cent of those polled thought tuition should remain the same. “I think everybody is looking for a bit of a discount,” said Campaign Research principal Nick Kouvalis. It’s partly a reflection of how people feel about online learning, he said, and “if people think they are not going to get the full experience” of being on campus, spending thousands on tuition doesn’t sit well. A number of student groups have also been pushing for a break on tuition for this fall. Campaign Research polled 1,434 people across Ontario last week, using the Maru Blue opt-in online panel. The equivalent margin of error for a random sample of the same size is plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The survey found the public is split on universities offering in-person classes this fall, with just over one-third supporting the move and 31 per cent opposing it. The remaining third were unsure. However, if classes were smaller, some 67 per cent of respondents feel it would be safe for students to be learning on campus. But when it comes to living on campus, just 27 per cent of those surveyed said it is safe to reopen residences, with 39 per cent saying it’s not. However, if universities only allow for one student per room, 55 per cent agree residences could safely operate this fall. About 50 per cent of respondents felt January 2021 to the best time to reopen residences. Some Ontario colleges and universities are planning for online-only learning this fall, with others promising a hybrid of remote and in-class sessions where possible. Some have closed residences or are planning for one to two students per room depending on the size of the space. Last month, the province announced a summer pilot project allowing post-secondary institutions to partially open their campuses to allow “academically stranded” students to complete lessons or labs they missed during the COVID-19 shutdown. Schools across the province — including all 24 public colleges — are taking part in the pilot, targeted at students studying health care, nursing or the trades, which call for practical, hands-on experience to graduate. Colleges and Universities Minister Ross Romano said the pilot will help guide schools as they plan to reopen safely this fall."

Health Minister Christine Elliott said there were 111 new cases reported Tuesday morning, with one death. “Locally, 28 of Ontario’s 34 public health units are reporting five or fewer cases, with fully 21 of them reporting no new cases at all,” Elliott said on Twitter. “With 122 more resolved, there are 11 fewer active cases in the province.” There are 137 patients in hospital with COVID-19 with 39 in intensive care units. Of those, 21 are on ventilators. Most of Ontario — excluding the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and parts of the southwest — will enter the third stage Friday, meaning restaurants and bars can serve meals indoors and gyms can reopen as long as physical distancing is maintained. Queen’s Park says 2,723 people have died from the virus since the pandemic struck in March, but the Star has determined there have been 2,761 coronavirus deaths in Ontario. That difference of 38 fatalities is because some were not included were not included early in the outbreak since COVID-19 tests had not been conducted before those people — most of whom were elderly residents of long-term-care homes — died. The government says there have been 36,950 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario. As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, a Star survey of Ontario’s regional health units found a total of 38,966 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19. Over the last week, the province’s 34 health units have reported an average of 127 new infections per day — well down from a sustained peak of nearly 600 cases per day, seen in late April. Tuesday’s 5 p.m. total, up 91 cases in 24 hours, did not include any new reports from Toronto, which has switched to updating just three days a week. The Star’s tally includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, which means they have symptoms, travel history or contacts that indicate they likely have the disease, but haven’t yet received a positive test from a lab."

Energy Minister Greg Rickford on Tuesday announced Susanna Zagar, a long-time bureaucrat, as the new chief executive officer of the OEB. Lynne Anderson, who was appointed to the board by the previous Liberal government in 2017, will be the OEB’s new chief commissioner. “I look forward to working together with these experienced leaders as we renew and modernize the OEB,” Rickford said in a statement. “Strong leadership will help the OEB better serve individuals and families, allow the provincial regulator to operate more effectively and efficiently, and help ensure that Ontario’s energy system remains sustainable and reliable, as was envisioned in the OEB review panel,” he said. In the wake of the Tories’ cronyism scandal last summer — when Premier Doug Ford’s then chief of staff resigned suddenly amid a furor over patronage postings — the government has moved to make appointments less partisan. The province says reforms at the OEB are aimed at “enhancing transparency and accountability” and “pursuing greater efficiencies” by “reducing regulatory burden.” Zagar, a former senior civil servant at Queen’s Park, has most recently been chief strategy officer at the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board. Also being appointed to the OEB are: John Knubley, a former federal deputy minister; business owner Gerald Moncrief; former media CEO Glenn O’Farrell; energy expert Marie Oswald; and business consultant Allison Duff."

In an interview with the Star on Tuesday, Ford was asked if his province-wide summer tour is to set the stage for a snap vote this fall. “No, not at all,” the premier said from Waterloo. “We’re going to year four.” That means the June 2022 election will go ahead as planned. While the province has a law on the books that fixes election dates at once every four years, the Progressive Conservatives could easily amend the legislation because they have a majority in the house. Opposition party strategists have privately worried Ford might opt to face voters earlier in order to get out ahead of the post-pandemic economic hardships that loom. “You might not want to be an incumbent premier or prime minister going to the polls in two years’ time if we’re in a deep recession,” said one senior Liberal insider, speaking on background in order to freely discuss strategy. “So we’ve told our team to get ready for any eventuality,” said the Grit, noting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s minority Liberal government is gearing up for a possible federal election. But Ford, who will spend the next eight weeks visiting 38 of Ontario’s 124 ridings in seven regions of the province, insisted his blitz is not a pre-election victory lap. “There’s no victory at all,” he said, emphasizing the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than 2,700 Ontarians and left the province in a state of emergency since March 17 is far from over. The premier launched his tour Tuesday at Cambridge’s Eclipse Automation, a company that retooled its machines to manufacture N95 and surgical masks and other medical supplies. He said he just wants to thank businesses “for stepping up” during the outbreak. “We’ve all been cooped at home in the bubble for too long. It’s a big province,” said Ford, who was also at Challenger Motor Freight before heading to Kitchener’s Shaver Industries, which is making 25,000 face shields a week for front-line workers. On Thursday, Ford will visit Essex County, where he’ll get his shaggy golden mullet trimmed by a local barber. “You wouldn’t believe how many barbers there are down there,” he enthused. Freshly coiffed, he plans to be back in Waterloo Region the following day. Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca expressed concern about the premier hitting the hustings. “Parents working from home are struggling with child care and Doug Ford is nowhere to be found,” said Del Duca. “His priorities are way out of order — he has a detailed plan to reopen pubs and movie theatres, but none to get our kids back in school this fall,” he said. “Doug Ford should spend his summer figuring out the crisis in our schools, not campaigning for re-election.” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Ford is displaying “poor judgment.” “Shame on him for worrying about his election chances as opposed to worrying about the things that everybody else are still worrying about,” said Horwath. “Things like businesses being able to weather the storm with a government that didn’t really help out at all, in terms of direct support. Everybody’s worried about [going] back to school and Ford decides he’s going to go campaigning? Really, really, really troubling,” she said. “It’s extremely disappointing that that’s what Mr. Ford thinks his job is — to seal his next election, as opposed to to continue to be here to deal with the crisis that’s unfolding still with COVID-19.” Green Leader Mike Schreiner charged that Ford is campaigning at the same time as his government is “failing to deliver for parents, students and teachers, a plan to safely reopen schools this fall.”  Ford’s barnstorming, which is designed to boost the Conservatives’ political fortunes, come as he has seen a rebound in public-opinion polls for the Star. The premier had a -49 per cent approval rating this time last year, when he was loudly booed at the Toronto Raptors’ victory celebrations at Nathan Phillips Square while Trudeau and Mayor John Tory were cheered. Last July, a poll found that just 20 per cent of respondents approved of the job he was doing while 69 per cent disapproved and 11 per cent had no opinion. But the latest Campaign Research poll for the Star found Ford now has an overall 39 per cent approval, a swing of 88 percentage points. The firm found 66 per cent approved of his performance with 27 disapproving and six per cent having no opinion.  Campaign Research polled 1,395 people across Ontario last Wednesday and Thursday using Maru Blue’s online panel. It is an opt-in poll, but for comparison purposes, a random sample of this size would have a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20. On Friday, much of the province will enter the third stage of reopening, meaning restaurants and bars can serve indoors and outdoor playgrounds will reopen. However, the GTA and Hamilton area will remain in the second stage for at least another week. Ford said has no regrets about moving slowly, noting American officials have “been reckless down there” by reopening the economy too quickly."

It’s not just Americans or Canadians who were shaking their heads over the injustice of it all. In Beijing’s leadership compound, and in Huawei’s halls of power, they likely had a similar reaction last week. And a pointed question: Why should Canada’s earnest claims about the impartiality and integrity of the justice system — not ours, but America’s — be taken seriously by China, or us, if Trump now treats it as a joke? Which raises another question: If many Americans no longer have faith in their own system, and China clearly doesn’t, why are we putting the Canadian justice system — and the lives of our fellow citizens — on the line? When the Mounties arrested Huawei’s Meng Wenzhou in transit at Vancouver airport at America’s request, China responded by ransoming the “two Michaels” — diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor — on trumped-up charges. While Canada saw only injustice at the trading in human lives, Trump jumped at the opportunity for horse-trading — musing publicly about a quid pro quo where he would drop the case against Meng if China acquiesced to a trade deal on favourable terms. Washington later walked back Trump’s incriminating talk. But in the months since, the U.S. has never gone beyond mere finger-wagging over China’s actions. Between offering to release Meng and announcing the release of Stone, the president has dropped any pretense of legality in the justice system over which he presides. In so doing, he has only deepened China’s political conviction that a judicial conviction in Trump’s America is a matter of political expediency, not impartiality — with Canada acting as an accessory. Canada has limited leverage with China, but we are not without options — in both Beijing and Washington. With extradition cases, Canada’s justice minister has the legal right to intrude or upend it at anytime, though this has never been done for blatantly political reasons (notably foreign bullying), lest our justice system be held hostage again in future. But we must also admit that the administration of justice has already been brought into disrepute by this case, which is utterly unlike any other. It involves a powerful defendant and two superpowers jockeying for position in a bipolar world while Canada — a mere middle power — tries to triangulate on behalf of two powerless Canadians. Watching our citizens interrogated in harsh conditions while Meng lives in the lap of luxury — bankrolling a private security force to satisfy her bail conditions regarding the risk of flight — offends our sense of justice. Quite apart from the asymmetry between Meng and “the two Michaels,” she enjoys privileges not afforded to — or affordable for — ordinary Canadians lacking her money and means. In light of those inequities, Ottawa could convey to the Chinese that it will instruct Justice Department lawyers to challenge Meng’s bail conditions on the grounds of security (never mind reciprocity). The crown could cite the case of former Renault boss Carlos Ghosn — who overcame strict bail conditions in Japan to flee to his native Lebanon — arguing that it has given Canada cause to reconsider (that it might give China pause to recalibrate can be left unspoken). Would a judge agree? If China remains convinced that our judiciary abides by political agendas, perhaps a quiet signal that we are considering such a move could serve as a perfectly justifiable — and just — thought experiment. We must admit, however, that a middle power like Canada has limited leverage with the Chinese. The same cannot be said of the Americans, who are both powerful and vulnerable. Ottawa would be well within its rights to give the Americans an ultimatum quietly at first, publicly if necessary, framed as a choice for them to make — leaving the ball very much in their court (if not a court of law): Canada must now consider Meng’s release, due not to Chinese actions but American inaction. That Trump mused last year about releasing Meng for a trade deal — imperilling the “two Michaels” by signalling that Canada was in cahoots on a contrived case — was itself indefensible. What’s truly unconscionable, however, is that the president has said almost nothing consequential since then about China’s pressure tactics. Imagine for a moment that an American diplomat were arrested in China in retaliation over the Meng case: Trump and Congress would be taking dramatic measures, escalating until China chose to de-escalate. It would surely impose painful sanctions against China — as it has on Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, and others with whom it has grievances, rightly or wrongly. Beyond empty words — few and far between — what has Washington done to make China pay for its transgressions against Canada as we act as America’s jailer? If China’s rulers can violate international norms with impunity, while an American president flouts his own judicial system with alacrity, what — and whose — rule of law is Canada upholding? Why take the heat for the Trump administration if it is unwilling to generate heat on our behalf? Time for Ottawa to send signals to both Beijing and Washington: The Chinese and Americans cannot fight their grudge match to the last Canadian."

That may or may not be enough to persuade the public to forgive him for not recusing himself from the controversial file. But even if it’s not, the $50-billion commitment could go a long way toward giving companies a lifeline as they emerge from the pandemic – as long as it’s designed strategically as well as quickly. The move was foreshadowed last week in Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s fiscal update and has been weeks in negotiation, so let’s not be too cynical about the motivation behind the multi-billion-dollar announcement that Trudeau blurted out within seconds of apologizing for his involvement in the WE fiasco. But there are no details available yet for how the subsidy will work, and for that, we can be plenty cynical. Trudeau had just one sentence about it in his morning news conference, and Morneau’s office would only say — with a smiley face attached — that details were not ready yet, It’s that kind of vague policy announcement that got the prime minister in trouble with the WE file to begin with — a headline designed to fill a political need, with the fine print to come sometime “soon,” once the officials can catch up with the politics of the day. The fine print is important here, for economics and politics alike. Morneau and Trudeau have pinned their hopes for an economic restart on the wage subsidy. In theory, when provincial governments relax their COVID-19 rules, as Ontario’s Doug Ford did on Monday, the wage subsidy will kick in and help companies stay above water when they reopen just half way. Ford said some regions of the province can now open up restaurants, bars and daycares, but not necessarily at full capacity because physical distancing rules remain in place. The hope is that the federal wage subsidy will shoulder a large part of the payroll of any company that is still losing a big chunk of its revenue compared to last year, allowing firms to reopen and bring back their workers even if they’re still constrained due to pandemic rules. But how much of their payrolls will be covered by this extension? How much money does a company have to be losing in order to qualify? And what about companies that are hoping to hire back minimum-wage workers, but can’t find any because they’re collecting the more lucrative Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)? Without those answers, companies won’t know if it’s worth their time and effort to reopen on Friday as the premier hopes, says Perrin Beatty, the president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “We need to get that information as soon as possible,” Beatty said. “It’s critical for tens of thousands of businesses, particularly in some sectors” such as tourism, travel, accommodation, retail and restaurants. When it was first introduced, the wage subsidy was available to companies that could show a 30 per cent drop in revenues compared to last year. But that agreement expired at the end of June, and now, government officials and business leaders alike say the 30 per cent cut-off is too harsh — there’s no incentive for a company hovering near the threshold to make an extra dollar if it might lose its payroll support as a result. Similarly, there’s a growing understanding within government that the CERB had its place in sustaining family finances during the dark days of the lockdown, but now it needs to be wound down and replaced as employers reopen so people will be encouraged to go back to work. These are complex policy questions that officials and experts have been hammering away at with increasing urgency, but that the prime minister — in his haste to have some good news in the face of scandal — rolled out before his civil service had the required paperwork in hand. That’s partly why he ended up in hot water with WE Charity. In late April, as the opposition NDP roared about the lack of financial help for students and threatened to withhold its support for COVID-19 aid without measures, Trudeau unveiled a generous $9-billion student aid package.  Along with commitments to create more summer jobs and extend emergency benefits to students was the creation of the Canada Student Service Grant — the program now swirling at the centre of the WE controversy. It’s now clear that the plan to pay students up to $5,000 for volunteer work was not nearly ready for prime time. After winding its way through cabinet approvals, it finally saw the light of day more than two months later, only to spark an immediate controversy. While the Liberals are paying a political price for that backwards process, students continue to go without their promised support. The wage subsidy talks are well advanced, but the economic stakes of getting the design just right are high. Let’s hope Trudeau didn’t speak too soon again."

The Campaign Research survey, conducted for the Star, also found that 71 per cent of respondents think educators should be mandated to use livestreaming if online learning continues, with the highest level of support in the Halton and Peel Regions. “The public is nervous, but feeling safe” with the government’s slow reopening during the pandemic, said Campaign Research principal Nick Kouvalis. However, he added, people are “still wary about full-on school ... but that could change in a month. If we get down to 50 cases a day, then people might change their mind.”  The poll comes as school boards and the provincial government face pressure to safely open up schools full-time to help working parents — especially women — return to or remain in the workforce as restrictions are eased during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The province has told boards to make plans for three scenarios — online only, in-class or a mix of the two. Campaign Research polled 1,434 people across Ontario last week, using the Maru Blue opt-in online panel. The equivalent margin of error for a random sample of this size is plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20. Among those surveyed, some 51 per cent supported the hybrid model, 18 per cent preferred in-class and 11 per cent supported online only. About 20 per cent did not have an opinion. As for online learning following the March shutdown of schools, almost 20 per cent said kids’ experience was excellent or good, with 26 per cent characterizing it as fair or poor. Some 55 per cent were unsure. But just 20 per cent of respondents said the quality of education during the extended shutdown was excellent or good, with 45 per cent calling it fair, or poor. Just over one-third did not have an opinion. At the legislature on Monday, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said “people can’t go back to work unless their kids are back in school and back in child care. While the premier spent last week ignoring pleas from parents frustrated by the lack of plans for September, school boards across the province spent their last week scrambling to try to put a school year together and calling on the premier to reverse his decision to send kids back to school part-time this fall.” She also said without an overarching plan, there will be a patchwork of different models and kids should have access to “quality public education that’s pretty equal around the province.” Premier Doug Ford said with “the best advice that we have from the chief medical officers right across this province we decided to let each school board make a decision, and we gave them three different criteria that they can work with.” Trustees in Toronto have raised concerns that kids need to be in class full time, and have urged the province to come up with creative solutions — such as finding extra space so schools can have more, smaller classes to accommodate as many students as possible. Boards had asked the province for local flexibility for this fall, Ford said, and “what I’m hearing from parents is that it’s a good plan. What I’m hearing from school board trustees is, ‘Thank you for giving us the option, rather than forcing options down our back.’” Ford added that “every jurisdiction is a little different and what applies up in Kenora doesn’t necessarily apply in Hamilton or in Toronto.”"

Why won't he explain how it happened?,['Susan DelacourtNational Columnist'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","Justin Trudeau made a bold bid to break up with the ethics controversy consuming his government on Monday with a new twist on an old classic: “It’s not WE. It’s me.”  There was nothing vague about the prime minister’s apology for how he and WE Charity have become tangled in an ethics storm over pandemic relief. In fact, Trudeau approached near-mathematical precision on Monday with his very personal regrets for what he had failed to do in the whole mess.  “The mistake we made was on me and I take responsibility for it,” he said. Trudeau said he was sorry he didn’t excuse himself from cabinet discussions about WE Charity, and also sorry he didn’t know more about the extent to which his family was involved with it.  What his apology didn’t cover was how this ended up in front of his cabinet in the first place, and the absence of red flags for him or his government — the crucial “what were you thinking” question that hangs over the entire story.  So while Trudeau’s words on Monday may have slightly cooled the ethics uproar that’s erupted in the midst of this pandemic, they won’t make it go away.  Significantly, his apology also offered no assurances for the future, and that’s important — this being his third brush with ethics investigations in his career as prime minister.  What has he learned about why this failed to set off ethical alarms from the outset? Monday’s me-not-WE apology didn’t quite cover that.  Trudeau’s regrets, for now, are intensely personal — maybe intentionally so. A larger, more expansive apology may not come until after the ethics commissioner’s inquiry.  It’s worth looking closely at how precise the prime minister was when he laid out on Monday where he’d gone wrong with WE and the proposal to have the charity handle nearly $1 billion in pandemic relief for students.  Trudeau did not say he was sorry about the idea, which he again said came from the public service, only that he didn’t officially bow out of the discussions about it.  “I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions, given our family’s history. I am sincerely sorry about not having done that,” Trudeau said, going on to cite all the ways the government had been working with other charities on pandemic relief. “But when it came to this organization and this program, the involvement I’d had in the past and my family has should have had me remove myself from those discussions.”  Note: Trudeau is not saying that the proposal shouldn’t have come to cabinet, only that he shouldn’t have been there. The prime minister also didn’t mention Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who has been found to have his own family conflicts with WE, including a daughter employed by the charity. It was left to Morneau to issue his own personal apology later in the day, in a separate statement, which followed the same general lines as those of his boss: not a bad idea, just unfortunately handled at cabinet.  Significantly, the finance minister hasn’t even ruled out the prospect of WE being the subject of cabinet discussions in future. “I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE,” Morneau’s statement said.  The most sincere, genuine part of Trudeau’s apology came when he was talking about how all of this has affected his mother, who has been very public — including at WE events — about her lifelong battles with mental illness.  “Obviously I knew she worked with WE,” Trudeau said. “I didn’t know the details of how much she was getting paid by various organizations but I should have and I deeply regret that. What I also deeply regret is the fact that I have brought my mother into this situation in a way that is really unfair to her.” Margaret Trudeau’s involvement with WE was definitely obvious. She and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau were together in London at a WE event in March, which is where the prime minister’s wife was believed to have contracted the COVID-19 virus that put the PM into isolation early in the pandemic.  Long before WE was picked as the favoured charity to hand out aid to students during the pandemic, in other words, it had already played a role that was a little too close to home.  Trudeau may be saving the larger, more expansive explanations for his discussions with the ethics commissioner, who will most certainly want to know more than just why the prime minister failed to absent himself from cabinet discussions about WE Charity. “It’s not WE, it’s me,” may work as a break in the heat of this controversy, but those won’t be the last words in this fraught relationship.

Premier Doug Ford said most of Ontario would enter stage three of the framework for reopening on Friday as new coronavirus cases remain low, but the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and parts of the southwest have to wait a week. “We need just a little more time,” Ford said Monday. Indoor restaurants, bars, gyms, cinemas and outdoor playgrounds can open in Ottawa, Brant County, Peterborough, Grey Bruce, Kingston, Kitchener-Waterloo, Guelph, Muskoka, Sudbury, North Bay and a slew of other regions. Toronto, Peel, Durham, Halton, York, Hamilton, Niagara, Haldimand-Norfolk, Windsor-Essex and Lambton will remain in the current second stage of reopening. Ford suggested those regions could open up as early as July 24, so long as new cases of coronavirus stay steadily low and Dr. David Williams, the province’s chief medical officer of health, gives him the green light. That’s the same day Ontario’s state of emergency, in place since March 17, is due expire after yet another extension was granted Monday by MPPs. Education Minister Stephen Lecce said as of July 27, all child-care centres across Ontario can open with up to 15 kids per room. Lecce said that should enable them to be at 90 per cent capacity, meaning more parents can get back to work. He added schools could also reopen for students in September, although that situation remains fluid. “We will be cautious, methodical and focused on safety to get this right, because keeping your child safe is what matters most,” he said. “I’ll be sharing more details soon about the return to school plan, which I know is top of mind for many parents around the province. We are confident in this plan to enable parents to return to work while having the peace of mind that their children are cared for.” Green Leader Mike Schreiner questioned the Progressive Conservative government’s strategy. “Securing a safe place for kids to be Monday to Friday should be a higher priority than allowing people to crowd into bars and restaurants,” said Schreiner. “We are still without a sound plan for education or new funding for child-care providers to implement COVID-19 safety protocols.” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the Tories need to offer more help for small businesses struggling in the pandemic, like subsidies for Plexiglas barriers and personal protective equipment for workers. “As we prepare to move into a new stage of our economic reopening, we must remember that small businesses across the province are struggling because Doug Ford didn’t provide the kind of direct support needed to keep Main Street healthy and vibrant,” said Horwath. The premier insisted Ontario has learned lessons from the U.S., where reopening businesses and attractions too quickly has led to a surge in cases. “I see these numbers from Florida and they’re staggering — 15,000 people that contracted COVID in a day, that is scary. But we’re being pretty vigilant. We aren’t rushing into anything,” said Ford.  After Friday, the places in stage three can have indoor gatherings of up to 50 people, while in stage two the limit remains at 10. Outdoor gatherings will be increased to a maximum of 100 people in the third stage. However, some restrictions will remain. Amusement parks and water parks will not be allowed to open. Nor will buffet restaurants, night clubs, overnight camps for children, private karaoke rooms, saunas, bath houses, oxygen bars or table games at casinos. In bars, there will be no dancing and all patrons will need to remain seated inside. For athletes, “prolonged or deliberate contact while playing sports is not permitted” in order to curb the spread of COVID-19. Spectators at such events must abide by the gathering limits and physical distancing restrictions. While gyms, fitness studios and community centres can reopen indoor facilities, similar measures will be in effect to keep people two metres apart. Concerts, artistic events, theatrical productions, performances and movie theatres can resume with limits. “Performers must maintain physical distancing of two metres from every other person, except from other performers where necessary for purposes of the performance,” the government said. Similarly, “audiences are subject to the number of people that can maintain physical distancing of at least two metres and cannot exceed gathering limits of 50 indoors and 100 outdoors,” it said. “This applies to the entire facility, regardless of the number of theatres or performance stages within the facility.” Ford said amusements parks and multiplex cinemas could make a pitch for exemptions to the rules. “If they come up with a plan, a proper plan that keeps people’s social distanced and in other areas and puts it forward to the chief medical officer and they approve it, then they can open,” he said."

Health Minister Christine Elliott said Monday that 29 of the province’s 34 public health units reported five or fewer cases, with 21 of them reporting no new cases at all. “Having seen a continued decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases as the province entered stage two, and with hospitalizations being at all-time lows, today we’re providing details about stage three of our plan to continue the safe and gradual reopening the province,” Elliott said on Twitter. There are 104 patients in Ontario hospitals with coronavirus, 28 of whom are in intensive care units. Of those, 20 are on ventilators. That encouraging data is why Premier Doug Ford unveiled the next steps of opening up the economy with much of the province to reopen Friday, though the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area will have to wait until at least late next week. Ontario has been in a state of emergency since March 17, meaning the government has had sweeping authority to close businesses and restrict the opening of public spaces. Most of the province will enter the third stage later this week, meaning restaurants and bars can serve meals indoors and gyms can reopen as long as safe physical distancing is maintained. The provincial government says 2,710 people have died from the virus since the pandemic struck in March, but the Star has determined there have been 2,759 COVID-19 deaths in Ontario. That difference of 49 fatalities is because early in the outbreak, some were not included since COVID-19 tests had not been conducted before the people — elderly residents of long-term-care homes — died. The government says there have been 36,839 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario. The government says there have been 36,839 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario. The Star’s tally includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases.  That means they have symptoms, contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive test from a lab."

He's right. It is. At one level, throne speeches are always vague. They set out the broad direction where the government — in this case Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's minority Liberal government — intends to go. They avoid detail. In that sense, Thursday's throne speech was classic. It summarized most of the Liberal election campaign promises that the government intends to proceed with, ranging from measures to combat climate change to gun control. But governments also use specific words to mean specific things. And pharmacare is one area where language is crucial. That's because the term pharmacare covers a lot of ground. To some, it means filling in the gaps — that is, providing drug insurance to the minority of Canadians who lack it. That's the version that Finance Minister Bill Morneau, in a burst of honesty, once said he favoured. It is also the preferred option of Andrew Scheer's Conservatives. To others, however, pharmacare it is a more ambitious idea, akin to medicare. Like medicare, it would be universal — that is, it would cover all Canadians, thus obviating the need for private or workplace-supplied drug insurance. Like medicare, it would be comprehensive and cover all necessary pharmaceuticals. Like medicare, it would be accessible — available to rich and poor alike on the basis of need. Like medicare, it would be portable, meaning that it would cover Canadians outside their home provinces. And like medicare, it would be publicly funded through tax revenue. It was this more ambitious version that an advisory panel, chaired by former Ontario health minister Eric Hoskins, recommended to the Trudeau government earlier this year. But Thursday's throne speech contains none of the language associated with the ambitious version. All it says is that the government ""will take steps to introduce and implement national pharmacare.""  What does ""national pharmacare"" mean? The throne speech doesn't say. But as Singh pointed out, there is no mention of universality or public funding. Nor is there any reference to the Hoskins report that the government itself commissioned. That Singh was able to find fault in the throne speech is politically convenient for the New Democrats. They need to stake out ground to the left of Trudeau's Liberals without triggering a costly snap election. In this case, they can do so. Bloc Québécois MPs have said that they will support the throne speech, thus giving the minority Liberal government enough votes to withstand any challenge in the Commons regardless of what the NDP does. Once serious debate on pharmacare begins, however, the New Democrats will have to square their support for universal, public drug insurance with their position on Quebec. That position, first articulated in the party's 2005 Sherbrooke Declaration and reaffirmed 10 years later, is that Quebec should be allowed to opt out of any new, federally funded social programs, such as universal pharmacare, but keep the money. It was designed to appeal to Quebec voters and, for a while, succeeded. But it could play havoc with Canada's ability to develop new national social programs. If Quebec is granted the right to opt out with compensation, the other nine provinces will demand the same treatment. The premiers have long made that clear. Still, kudos to Singh for pointing out the contradictions in the Liberal approach to pharmacare. If he could only sort out his own party's contradictions, we might be able to get somewhere.

Justin Trudeau did just that last week. He  donned his Teflon suit once again. The prime minister staggered to the new year, exposed as committing a serious ethics violation, shielding a finance minister who was trying to dig out of his own hole, taking it on the chin about unrequited trade. Or so it seemed in the so-called Ottawa bubble, the snow globe I called home for many years. Maybe only the bubble denizens thought the prime minister was a little lost. So, as he hit the halfway point in a cross-country town hall tour late last week, Trudeau reminded those who pack these events that it's ""easy to get sucked into the Ottawa-centric"" bubble around Parliament. He calls these town halls a grounding exercise. More accurately, it is an exercise in getting out of Dodge to rebuild your image. This is how Trudeau was elected prime minister. He was out meeting voters before the 2015 writ was issued rather than standing in the corner of the Commons firing questions to a government on message track. The fact is, Trudeau is not a stellar performer in the Commons. But he is good in the town hall format, and he should receive much credit for ensuring questions were not vetted - unlike the slick, partisan events put on by Stephen Harper as Mike Duffy lobbed him softballs - and dealing easily with hecklers. But at last  week's session at McMaster University, no one asked him about the holiday with the Aga Khan, though he was asked a day earlier in Nova Scotia.  No one asked him why his MPs voted against him appearing before the parliamentary ethics committee.  No one asked him about trade with China, or the future of NAFTA.  No one asked him about Finance Minister Bill Morneau's foibles or insults from Minister of Persons with Disabilities Kent Hehr. No one was allowed to ask a followup. And, unlike the daily question period, Trudeau could take as long as he wanted in response, rhapsodizing about diversity and equality and freedom of speech as long as he wished. It is his show, his sweet spot, and it must gall the opposition that he is still treated like a celebrity in those settings. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer would likely only get a viral clip from a town hall if he fell off the stage. That doesn't mean there weren't perceptive questions for Trudeau. One man asked him why, as a champion of Indigenous reconciliation, he did not acknowledge the traditional territories of Hamilton (Haudenosaunee and Mohawk). Another asked how Trudeau could protect Canadians from returned ISIS fighters when he didn't even take proper security precautions for his Hamilton event. But even in an event that promises spontaneity, there are rules. Make sure to have a lot of diverse faces behind you for the cameras. Take a breather every now and again. Call on the guy sporting the Liberal button and invite the Grade 5 student to ask a question. Charming, but a nice break. He was asked if he believed in freedom of speech and what his legacy might be. It beats having questions shouted at him in a media scrum. Trudeau, like all successful politicians, shines when handling hecklers. Brian Mulroney often fought his way past angry demonstrators to enter an event, responding with a smile and his baritone, ""Ah, I'll put you down as undecided."" NDP leader Jagmeet Singh received international attention and praise by preaching love and tolerance to a racist heckler right in his face. An alternative approach? Jean Chr�tien famously delivered the ""Shawinigan handshake"" to a protester at a Flag Day event, grabbing him by the neck. It worked for Chr�tien. Trudeau won a standing ovation in dealing with a heckler's diatribe about the Omar Khadr payout, and it won him this front-page headline in the Hamilton Spectator: ""Prime Minister is a chip off the old Trudeaumania."" So far, the Teflon suit fits well. But there is a reason we vote for men and women and place them in that bubble. They must be accountable to Parliament, and they should be required to take questions from parliamentarians on their misconduct. Trudeau can revel in his town hall love, but he should have sat and taken questions from Ottawa's ethics committee. And when Parliament returns, he won't be fielding any questions about his legacy. "

The prime minister should be careful what he asks for. The much-discussed but still theoretical Canada-China free trade pact has been undergoing a kind of perils-of-Pauline adventure this week. It seemed alive and well Sunday when the prime minister landed in Beijing, reportedly to announce with his Chinese counterpart that formal negotiations on the deal were ready to begin. By Monday it seemed at grave risk, as it became clear that a significant snag existed, which precluded such an announcement. By Tuesday, the hint of a deal was in the air again following news that Trudeau was leaving his international trade minister, Francois-Philippe Champagne, in China to keep on talking. China and Canada have held preliminary discussions for roughly a year. Simply put, that means they have been trying to figure out whether they have enough in common to bother engaging in real talks. China wants tariff-free access to Canada for its exports and the freedom for its companies, many of which are state-owned, to invest where they will. Canada wants reciprocal privileges but it also wants more. Trudeau's Liberal government wants what it calls a comprehensive and progressive deal that would cover a wide range of economic activities. Specifically, as the prime minister noted this week, it wants a deal that would include gender, labour and environmental rights. But I suspect that Canada's wish list is quite a bit longer and involves areas that go beyond mere trade, such as intellectual property, dispute settlement mechanisms and regulatory harmonization. All of these are part and parcel of the newest generation of trade deals, including the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union. Government officials routinely cite that pact as a model. But do Canadians really want a comprehensive economic agreement with powerful yet low-wage China? In some cases, the answer would be an unqualified yes. As Australia has discovered, China is a master at using technical regulations to block agricultural imports that, under a 2015 trade deal between the two countries, are supposed to enter freely. Presumably, in any Canada-China deal, Ottawa would try to curb Beijing's use of these so-called nontariff barriers. But Canadians might be less amenable if China insisted on challenging our health and safety or immigration regulations in the name of free trade. In Australia's case, China insisted that its firms operating in Australia be allowed to import temporary Chinese workers. This almost cost the deal its bipartisan parliamentary support — until a compromise was reached whereby any Chinese temporary workers brought in were assured of Australian wage rates. Australia's experience highlights the difficulties of melding high-wage and low-wage countries in a single free trade pact. The Trudeau Liberals argue that they can finesse this by including a labour rights chapter in any deal. But would the Chinese dictatorship of President Xi Jinping seriously countenance, say, independent trade unions? It doesn't tolerate any other power centre that might threaten the ruling Communist Party's monopoly of control. Comprehensive trade and investment deals are difficult enough when the signatories are of equal weight. They become more difficult when, as in the case of the North American Free Trade Agreement, one partner (Mexico) follows a deliberate low-wage policy. They can become impossibly tricky if that low-wage partner is also the dominant player in the relationship. So raise a glass to the idea of modest goals. It took 10 years for China and Australia to hammer out their relatively primitive free trade deal. Canada and China have been at it for only one. Trade with China is almost certainly a good idea. It's already happening without a formal deal. But a comprehensive economic relationship? Maybe not."

The question comes to mind again following former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn's decision to plead guilty to charges of lying to the FBI about his conversations in late 2016 with Russia's then ambassador to Washington. So far, most reportage has concentrated on the effect this will have on U.S. President Donald Trump, But I'm stuck on a prior question: Why did Flynn feel it necessary to lie in the first place? What was wrong with someone sure to be a key member of the new administration talking to an important foreign ambassador? Specifically, what was wrong with Flynn's asking Russia not to escalate a round of tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions? Technically, Flynn could have been charged under an obscure 1799 law aimed at preventing private citizens from discussing matters of state with foreign entities. But it's a law that, for obvious reasons, has never been used. I expect Flynn wouldn't have bothered lying to the FBI about conversations with, say, the Canadian ambassador on matters of mutual interest. But, in this climate, talking to the Russians was simply one step too far. The ostensible reason is the widely held belief that Russian hackers working under Putin's orders undermined the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The unspoken corollary is that Putin is responsible for Trump's victory. The reigning conspiracy theory is that Trump and/or his minions colluded with Putin to bring this about. All of this is possible. Sometimes there are conspiracies. The simpler explanation, however, is that Trump won because his brand of right-wing populism worked particularly well in the complicated U.S. electoral college system and because his opponent, Hillary Clinton, ran a terrible campaign. But the conspiracy theory fits the popular Western notion of Putin as evil genius. I'm not sure why this notion holds. It is true that Russian elections are stacked. But as longtime political operative Donna Brazile has pointed out in a recent book, so is the U.S. Democratic Party's nomination process. At least the Russians do have elections, a nicety that the Saudis, say, don't bother with. Putin is justly criticized for unilaterally annexing Crimea to Russia. Yet no Western government berates China for its unilateral annexation of Tibet in 1950. Beijing's argument that Tibet is historically part of China is accepted. Putin's argument that Crimea is historically part of Russia is not. Indeed, the West's kid-glove treatment of Chinese President Xi Jinping stands in stark contrast to the way it approaches Putin. Xi is not routinely denounced as an undemocratic autocrat, although he is one. Canada, for instance, has imposed economic sanctions against figures around Putin for their gross violation of human rights. It has done nothing against Chinese rights violators close to Xi. Some of the reasons for this double standard are economic. China is the world's second-largest economy. Western business people want a piece of the action. To that end, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's trip to China thus week is focused on trade and investment. Don't expect sunny Trudeau to dwell on downers such as Xi's human rights record. Other reasons for the double standard are geopolitical. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the West became accustomed to a diminished Russia. To see it reasserting itself today in its traditional spheres of influence — Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Baltic states, Central Asia — is disconcerting. China is also reasserting itself, particularly in the South China Sea. But that has given rise to little popular alarm in the West. Which brings me back to Michael Flynn and America's current fascination with the Russian threat. The notion of Trump as Putin's malleable tool has the eerily familiar ring of Cold War paranoia. And it is equally improbable."

The bar and the NDP leadership hopeful both have rich musical histories, so before he sits down for a bite, he has to bound over to say hi to the bartender, himself a member of a well-known band. Of course. Angus, an old rocker, is in the final days of his longest tour of all. It's the waning days of the party's leadership race, one that has been fought well below the national radar, but one that has major ramifications for Canadian politics. For Angus to win, he must motivate the party's longtime members, many of whom he admits had let their memberships lapse, had drifted and were still bruised by a spirit-breaking 2015 campaign defeat. He is believed to have most of that support, but they have to be enthusiastic enough to vote when balloting begins Sept. 18. He must beat back an insurgent campaign from Ontario MPP Jagmeet Singh, the late campaign momentum of Quebec MP Guy Caron, who Tuesday picked up the endorsement of former party president Brian Topp, and the hard-left movement being built by Manitoba MP Niki Ashton. Angus is working to return the NDP to the days of Jack Layton, when members had a stake in decisions and felt valued, before the days when they were impersonally hit up for cash and told what the party's message was. The party under Tom Mulcair had become rigid, hidebound, overly bureaucratic and afraid to take risks or make mistakes. It was the antithesis of bold. The Orange wave became the beige puddle. It's been a tough road for Angus. He's had to campaign with the weight of his sister's death this summer. He's had to endure sniping that he is too old, that politics, particularly leadership politics, are for the younger. Angus is 54, nine years older than Justin Trudeau, 16 years older than Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and Singh. ""Andrew Scheer acts a lot older than me,'' he laughs. ""I am a generation younger than (Bernie) Sanders or (Jeremy) Corbyn.'' His ability to bring the party back in Quebec is rightly questioned, although he would likely make Caron a deputy leader and Quebec lieutenant. Singh says he has signed up 47,000 of the almost 124,000 eligible voters, including 30,000 in Ontario. Angus believes those numbers are bogus, part of a Singh bluff and bluster effort to win on the first ballot. Singh has not backed down from his tally. But Angus won't reveal his own membership numbers. Many Singh supporters will be seen as instant New Democrats and their commitment to the party beyond their candidate will be questioned. But this is the bottom line in this leadership race. If Singh gets his people out to vote, Angus's efforts to build bridges to second or third ballot support may not matter. As leader he would target the Liberal government for walking away from promises. He lists a ""cynical"" walk away from electoral reform. Not so much the policy, but more a prime minister blatantly breaking his word. On Indigenous reconciliation, he says Trudeau has been all talk and symbols. Angus is rightly appalled at the sight of Liberal ministers going to court to fight a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision aimed at helping Indigenous children. He sees an Indigenous justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, fighting residential school survivors in court. He sees a brutally inefficient Indigenous Affairs bureaucracy that can't deliver services while children die and continues to try to erase Indigenous identity. He would create an independent child's ombudsman who could act so kids aren't dying because somebody's request for help is sitting on a desk somewhere. He believes the Liberal government has also failed on the environment after its grand promises at the Paris environmental summit. He would legislate the limits on greenhouse gas emissions, but remains somewhat vague on the West Coast Kinder Morgan pipeline which has pitted the Alberta NDP government of Rachel Notley against the British Columbia NDP government of John Horgan. He says he is concerned about the safety of the pipeline expansion and he does not believe it has garnered the ""social license"" needed for the project but he wants to move beyond pipeline debates and talk about a new energy industry in this country. Angus has the chops for the job and could reinvigorate the party from the bottom up. But only if the party looks away from the flash of the Singh insurgency."

Well, you'd want to start your day promoting a book by a Milwaukee county sheriff who has called Black Lives Matter a hate group, is a known racial profiler and, naturally, is a big Donald Trump supporter. The book foreword was written, of course, by your best bud forever in the media, Sean Hannity. Then you would turn your attention to tropical storm Harvey, congratulating yourself on how you saved so many lives — a victory lap even as the water kept rising in Houston and area — but you wouldn't want to dwell on that, so you would move on to your 2016 electoral success in Missouri, take a shot at the crime rate in Mexico and again vow that it will somehow pay for a border wall, then move on to trade negotiations. ""We are in the NAFTA (worst trade deal ever made) renegotiation process with Mexico & Canada. Both being very difficult, may have to terminate?"" Uh-oh. Trump's thumbs are now typing ""Canada"" on Sunday mornings. Last week, in an infamous stream-of-consciousness meltdown in Phoenix, he said the same thing, telling supporters he would probably end up ""terminating the deal at some point,"" because ""we have been so badly taken advantage of."" One can get permanently lost down a rabbit hole trying to make sense of the various tweets and pronouncements from Trump, but the shout-out to Sheriff David Clarke, Trump's coming rally in Missouri, his ongoing fantasy about a Mexican-financed wall and his continued threats to tear up NAFTA actually do have a common thread. They are all campaign preoccupations from a man who has never stopped campaigning and who never really became president. The Trump tweet is the cyber-equivalent of the boss walking past the negotiating room banging on a frying pan with a hammer and squeezing an air horn. But it is nothing more than that. This is no Art of the Deal. This is the Rant of the Attention-Seeker. It's not about us. It's all about him. Texans, at least those not scrambling atop their homes to save their lives, may want to be reminded that almost 50 per cent of their exports go to their top two trading partners, Mexico and Canada, and they import about 42 per cent of their goods from their NAFTA partners. While you're trying to stay above rising flood waters, it's good to know your president is musing about ripping up a trade deal so vital to your state. At least a couple of Canadian politicians couldn't help themselves Sunday. ""The only thing that needs to be terminated is your presidency,"" Hamilton Mayor Fred Eisenberger wrote. ""Save yourself and your country. Resign and you will be popular everywhere."" NDP leadership candidate Charlie Angus was somewhat more poetic: ""A poor player struts/frets his hour on the stage and then is heard no more. A tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing."" He moderated his comments later in the day, pushing the government to keep its eye on the ball. That's what it's doing. Adam Austen, a spokesperson for Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, is becoming quite practised at tossing out the political equivalent of Xanax. ""We will work with our partners at all levels in the United States to promote Canada-U.S. trade, which supports millions of jobs across the continent,"" he said. ""As we have said before, trade negotiations often have moments of heated rhetoric. Our priorities remain the same, and we will continue to work hard to modernize NAFTA, supporting millions of middle-class jobs."" Even if Trump did, in a fit of pique, seek to terminate NAFTA, it's not certain he could do it. Congress, not Trump, is ultimately responsible for giving a thumbs-up or thumbs-down to any renegotiated deal. There is also legislation on the books that enshrines NAFTA and there could be enough pro-trade, had-enough-of-Trump Republicans to decide the 24-year-old legislation overrides any presidential attempt to kick the pact into the ditch. All three countries have agreed to fast-track talks, but the first negotiating session has just ended and the second, in Mexico, doesn't begin until Friday. They have to ignore the bully in the corridor banging on his campaign-era frying pan. If you're Canadian and Trump thinks we're being ""difficult,"" there's only one sane reaction: Good. And pack a pair of noise-cancelling headphones."

Minister says she’s still looking for answers,"[""Rob FergusonQueen's Park Bureau""]","Fri., April 17, 2020","It’s unclear why measures aimed at putting an “iron ring” around nursing homes failed to stop COVID-19 from causing “tragic” levels of death and illness, says Long-Term-Care Minister Merrilee Fullerton. The admission came as the province revealed three-quarters of the new coronavirus fatalities officially reported Thursday in Ontario were of vulnerable nursing-home residents.  At least 933 have tested positive for COVID-19, along with 530 nursing-home staff to date, the highest toll of any workers in the health-care sector.  The measures to protect nursing homes include screening of new admissions, staff and volunteers and stiff restrictions on visitors.  But on Thursday the province added more measures. They include the temporary ban on transfers of hospital patients to long-term care unless in extraordinary circumstances, and only with a COVID-19 test followed by 14 days in isolation with droplet and contact precautions. Nursing-home residents in the same room as a patient with symptoms will now be tested, as will all residents in adjacent rooms, all staff on the unit or nursing-care hub involved, any essential visitors and other contacts as deemed necessary. Wider surveillance testing will also be conducted in select nursing homes to get a wider picture of disease.  Fullerton, a former family doctor, called the highly contagious virus different from the expected influenza pandemic and said improved testing and the freeze on hospitals transferring patients to long-term care will help limit the damage. The goal is “to understand how elusive this COVID-19 is and what else we can do, what other tools we have for this,” she added, acknowledging some nursing homes were scrambling for staff even before the illness hit. “It’s a new virus with a new way of spreading,” Fullerton told reporters, saying the way it is shared by people who are not showing symptoms has made it difficult to manage.  Statistics on outbreaks in more than 100 of the province’s 626 nursing homes became increasingly grim Thursday, further evidence of what Premier Doug Ford has famously dubbed a “wildfire.” More than half, or 271, of the 514 new coronavirus cases reported by the Ministry of Health were in nursing-home residents who accounted for 29 of the 38 new deaths.  That’s the “first time” COVID-19 infections in nursing homes have outpaced new infections in the community, said chief medical officer of health Dr. David Williams. The provincial numbers are based on reports from Ontario’s public health units as of 4 p.m. the previous day. The numbers indicate COVID-19 cases in nursing homes grew at a rate of 12 per cent in 24 hours, double the rate in the general population. Across Canada, almost half of deaths from the illness are in long-term-care residents and 93 per cent of fatalities are in those over age 60.  Officially, Ontario has reported 162 deaths of nursing-home residents but a more up-to-date Star compilation of reports and news releases from public health units puts the number closer to 250. Critics said the province should have put as much effort into preparing nursing homes for the onslaught as it did getting hospitals ready for a surge of patients that has not yet materialized.  “It should never have come to this,” said NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, urging Ford to detail a plan to take over direct management of nursing homes with severe outbreaks, as has happened in British Columbia. “Families deserve answers as to why their mothers and fathers were not better protected,” added Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca, calling for a public inquiry. Acting on a promise made by Ford earlier this week, Fullerton said teams from several Toronto hospitals including Mount Sinai and North York General have been sent to 38 area nursing homes to determine what help they need with patient care, infection prevention and control, testing and personal protective equipment. The ministry would not reveal the names of the nursing homes.  “This is the model that we will be expanding across the province.”"
