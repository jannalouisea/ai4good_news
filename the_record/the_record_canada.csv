She’s the grandmother of Ashley Thomson, who was just four months old when she was ripped from her car seat and sucked up as high as a three-storey building by the twister at Pine Lake on July 14, 2000. The twister set her down, completely naked, a few hundred metres away on a golf driving range. She had little more than a cut to her left foot. “It is a miracle,” Thomson, who’s now 73, told The Canadian Press at her family farm northwest of Pine Lake. “Her mommy finds the car upside down with the car seat hanging there, with the clips all still done up, but no baby. “The car did several flips down the hill and her father remembers just seeing her little bare feet go out the window.” The child dubbed “Miracle Baby” in news headlines is now a business student at a college in nearby Red Deer. The 20-year-old didn’t learn about her near-death experience until she was five or six. “As I got older, it sparked an interest in me to hear everyone’s stories,” she said in a text message. “I was even more curious what happened to me. “What happened to me that day no one, including me, will ever know. The one thing I do know is that I had someone looking over me and my entire family.” Thirteen Thomson family members were at the Green Acres RV park that day. Heather Thomson said she had gathered about a half dozen nieces, nephews and grandchildren into their fifth-wheel trailer when the storm hit, bringing with it hail the size of baseballs. “I look out the window and I see two little boys running but they’re not going anywhere ... then these big chunky hailstones start to fall. I said to all these kids, ‘You guys all get down on the floor. Grandma’s never seen hailstones this big!” she said. “We’re lifted up in the air and we’re thrown down. The refrigerator came and hit my husband in the face. The microwave came out of the cupboard. The dishes all fell on top of us. And then the stronger part of the tornado, the back, turned us upside down.” She suffered broken ribs and a shoulder injury. Her husband, Butch Thomson, now 75, had blood gushing down his face where the fridge had struck him. With a finger, he traces a scar barely visible from his forehead, to the side of his nose, and down to his jaw. “I bet in 20 seconds it was over ... We were just up and down and upside down and that was it,” he said “I was kind of stunned there for the longest time. I didn’t know what the hell had happened.” Jillisa Thomson was five. She remembers being in the trailer with her grandparents. “I remember them lying over top of me and then us flipping and flipping ... We stayed for a bit and then we walked up this hill,” she said. “I remember Grandma trying to carry us up this hill and she’s just broken.” Dean and Rachel Thomson were also injured. He had stayed in the car with their baby, while his wife went into the campground office to check in. She was sucked up by the tornado and slammed into trees before she dropped to the ground. He was banged up in the car, then frantically searched for their missing daughter before finding her on the golf course. Ashley Thomson said she may not remember the tornado, but her parents and the rest of her family do. “This anniversary shows me their strength and bravery and I couldn’t be more blessed,” she said. “This experience changed my life. I believe that whoever was watching over me that day wants me to do great things.” Forest growth has covered most of the scars at the campground. Trees have been replanted and rows of trailers sit at campsites A large rock stands as a memorial near the lake and is surrounded by one tree for each person the tornado took from the world. “A tribute to a community which suffered great loss but showed great support, courage and heroism. Remembering those who lost their lives,” reads a plaque with the names of the dead. Heather Thomson said she and her family feel blessed. “Because we should have lost people. Other families lost family members. “We’re all alive and really no lasting physical effects from it. Maybe some mental ones, but we’re all pretty healthy.”"

The call for answers comes as the government tries to chart a way forward for the new Canada Student Services Grant, which has been in limbo after WE Charity withdrew from administering the program amid controversy over its links to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family. The Liberals have billed the grant program as a way to reward tens of thousands of students who want to help with the COVID-19 pandemic and can’t find paid work. Participants were told they could earn up to $5,000 toward their education costs by volunteering the maximum 500 hours. Opposition parties say the Liberals could have accomplished the same task without controversy by putting the money into the Canada Summer Jobs program, through which thousands of positions for students are subsidized by the federal government every year. “The government chose specifically to ignore the opportunity of the Canada Summer Jobs and instead went for this,” Conservative economic development critic Dan Albas said of the Canada Student Services Grant. “It makes no sense ... They put a ton of money — $912 million — towards an untested concept when they have a ready-to-go program.” The Liberals have expanded the summer-jobs program by increasing the wage subsidy available to companies and not-for-profit groups to 100 per cent of the local minimum wage, expanding what types of positions qualified and extending the eligible work period to early next year. Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough’s office also noted the Liberals injected an extra $60 million to create 10,000 more positions than last year for students. The move brought the total budget for the program to $323 million and the expected number of summer jobs to 80,000. “This additional investment is helping more youth stay connected to the labour market, save money for their return to school, and find quality jobs in safe, inclusive, and healthy work environments,” Qualtrough spokesperson Ashley Michnowski said in an email. “By adapting the program this year, our government is making sure that we have the resources needed to support Canadian workers, businesses, and communities dealing with the social and economic impacts of COVID-19.” But the opposition says the available funding is not enough to cover demand in a normal year. The federal Employment and Social Development Department itself says on its website that in 2019, “requests for funding totalled more than three times the program budget.” Neither the government nor WE have said how many volunteer positions they were expecting to fill through the $912-million grant program. There has been criticism that participants receive only $10 per hour — less than the minimum wage in any province. There have also been questions about many positions advertised as available through the volunteer scheme, including thousands for students to shoot videos, make websites and create other content in placements apparently created by WE to meet the requirements of the volunteer program. NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus said that stands in contrast to the summer jobs program after the government asked members of Parliament across the country to identify potential positions in their ridings in the spring — many of which did not get funding. “We had really legitimate organizations ready to hire students to do legitimate work, and all of that was sidelined,” Angus said. “These were a lot more credible positions than making a video showing how to do exercises.” The Liberals have indicated they plan to move ahead with the volunteer program despite WE’s withdrawal, saying the federal Employment Department has taken over and is looking at ways to make it happen. But the Conservatives, NDP and Greens all say the government should learn its lesson and put the money into the Canada Summer Jobs program, which is already managed by the government and has a history of success. That starts with revisiting what the Tories and New Democrats suggested was the large number of summer jobs requested by businesses and not-for-profits and not funded because of a shortage of money. “The government should be focused on a program that is transparent, that is fair, that is broadly supported by all parties, and that already has a number of applications that have been ranked and have not been filled just because there’s not enough money,” Albas said. Green MP Elizabeth May said organizations that applied for positions through the student-volunteer program should also be allowed to transfer their requests to the summer-jobs program. And if that is not possible, Angus said, the government should be looking at taking the money and putting it into direct financial support for students, including by adding the funds to the Canada Emergency Student Benefit for those unable to find work due to COVID-19. “They have two options: One is to put that money into Canada Summer Jobs and one is to put it straight into the support for university students so they have the funds necessary to go to school and cut out all these schemes they worked out with WE,” he said. “I think they need to move on this immediately. The summer is getting close to half over. It may be at this point too difficult to get the Canada Summer Jobs up, but there are a lot of organizations that we submitted names for.” Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet, meanwhile, repeated a call on Tuesday for Trudeau to step aside in favour of his deputy Chrystia Freeland while the WE affair is fully investigated. But Blanchet said that based on what’s known now, he doesn’t believe the Liberal government should fall over it."

In a post on its website, the government says Air Canada Flight 7947 from Toronto on July 4 and WestJet Flight 296 from Calgary on July 6 had confirmed cases of the coronavirus on board. The province doesn’t have information to offer on the affected seats on the WestJet flight, but says anyone sitting in rows 14 to 20 on the Air Canada flight may have been exposed. The government is urging passengers to self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days after arriving at their destination. People who think they may have been exposed to the virus on those flights can use the Public Health Agency of Canada’s self-assessment tool to gauge symptoms. Saskatchewan also offers a self-assessment tool. As of Monday, the province had 90 active COVID-19 infections with three people in hospital. There have been a total of 871 cases, 766 people have recovered and 15 have died. "

The girl known publicly as Amira was found on the side of a road last year after her parents and siblings were killed in an airstrike, and she was taken to a refugee camp. Her uncle, known as Ibrahim, has been trying to get her out of Syria and to Canada but the federal government has refused to help. His lawyers filed a lawsuit in Federal Court on Tuesday saying that in failing to assist the child, the government is violating her rights. “Ibrahim has done everything humanly possible, including travelling to Syria on his own without security or protection, in an effort to bring his niece home to Canada,” the application says. “The respondents, despite their statutory and international law obligations and the rights of the applicant Amira, guaranteed by the charter, have for more than a year been unwilling to take a single step to enable the repatriation of Amira to take place.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been asked on June 29 why the federal government wasn’t doing more to get Canadians out of the region. Trudeau said while there are countries that have diplomats on the ground in Syria, Canada is not one of them and it remains a dangerous place. “We will continue to ensure that we’re keeping as a priority the protection of Canadians working abroad, particularly in this COVID context, but in every context,” he said. In the court application, lawyers note that other countries with no consular services in Syria have leaned on other countries or humanitarian groups to help repatriate their citizens. The court documents state that Amira is one of 47 Canadians, 26 of whom are children, stuck in northeastern Syria. The regional government has urged countries to repatriate their citizens. In the court documents, lawyers say Ibrahim met personally with officials to plead Amira’s case. The documents say he was assured that upon Canada’s request, and coupled with the attendance of a delegate or representative of the Canadian government, the local government “would be only too pleased to facilitate the repatriation of Amira to Canada.”"

The provincial government announced today it will order an end to the system that sees children’s aid societies send notifications to hospitals if they believe a newborn is at risk. The government says research suggests the alerts have disproportionately targeted racialized families, and it’s committed to creating a more culturally appropriate child welfare system. It says that while birth alerts have never been required under provincial law, they have been inconsistently applied across children’s aid societies. The government says the practice must end by October 15, and societies must instead work with hospitals and community-based service providers to come up with pre and postnatal plans that better support families. The announcement comes two weeks after the Manitoba government officially ended birth alerts in that province, a move that took effect on July 1."

While he declined to answer questions from media, in a emailed statement Tuesday, Chief Scott Woods said while he was “deeply disappointed” in the actions and attitudes of the two officers, he took “some consolation in knowing that they have been held accountable.” Sgt. Jason Carrier and Const. Keon Woronuk had their ranks bumped down for one and two years, respectively, after a disciplinary hearing found them guilty of multiple counts of misconduct. Back in 2017, the two on-duty, uniformed officers surreptitiously took photos of then-environment minister Shannon Phillips as she took a meeting at a Lethbridge cafe. Afterwards, Carrier watched her leave the cafe from his vehicle, while Woronuk set up to surveil the cafe, and followed one of the diners — though it’s not clear who — and ran their plates. They both admitted later that they’d been upset about Phillips’s plan to protect nearby wilderness.  The revelations have sent shockwaves to the very top of Alberta’s political leadership, with Premier Jason Kenney calling the incident “deeply disturbing” in a tweet Monday night. The justice minister has directed Alberta’s police watchdog to review the incident, including whether or not there are grounds for a criminal investigation. The incident was only revealed to the public after it was reported on by Chat News Now in Medicine Hat, which obtained a copy of the disciplinary report. That report has not been made public. Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer tweeted that he’d only learned of the incident on Monday night, after news had broke.  In the statement, Woods said, although these matters had been conducted in public hearings — and those notices are posted on the police website — the service is “limited” in what information it can release to the public. “The misconduct and discipline regime under the Police Act and Police Service Regulation incorporates a significant human resources element into the process — it is not purely punitive in nature,” he wrote. “Police Services do not have clear authority to release the full details of discipline hearings and outcomes.” There is a mention of the outcome on the police website that notes two officers had been sanctioned, though it doesn’t include details of the incident or names of the officers involved.  Now that the events have been reported on publicly, Woods said in the statement, he had more leeway to speak about them publicly.  “The actions for which these officers — Sgt. Jason Carrier and Cst. Keon Woronuk — were disciplined cannot be excused. The fact that they admitted to the charges of misconduct indicates that they acknowledge this reality,” he wrote. According to the disciplinary report, both officers did ultimately admit to multiple charges.  However, at their first hearing in September 2019, they entered “deny pleas” to all accounts. According to the agreed statement of facts, Woronuk admits he wasn’t totally forthcoming with police officials about their actions. When Calgary police began investigating, the disciplinary report said, Woronuk told them about a series of internet searches he did that evening to “ascertain the identity of one of the stakeholders,” but didn’t tell them he’d run any plates. He later said that he didn’t mention the plates because he was only responding to Phillips complaint about her photos being posted, though acknowledged that could be seen as “misleading.” Carrier meanwhile, has maintained that he was not involved in any surveillance or traffic enforcement of Phillips, but acknowledged that he did not report Woronuk’s search of the police database to a superior, which was a breach of policy exacerbated by the fact that he was a sergeant in a leadership position.  Wood’s statement goes on to say that Lethbridge police took the initiative in referring the incident for investigation, and it was investigated thoroughly by an outside agency, and outside counsel was retained to “vigorously prosecute” the charges. An “experienced, well-respected retired senior officer from another Services” presided over the hearings.  “The sanctions that were imposed against the officers were, to use the words of the Presiding Officer, ‘significant and on the high end of what may be considered appropriate.’” Woods added that the outcome does not relieve the “embarrassment and shame” that has been brought on Lethbridge police.  It also doesn’t “mitigate the justified anger and profound disappointment of Ms. Phillips and others in our community who have a right to expect so much better from their Police Service.” Woronuk admitted to five counts of misconduct, according to a notice posted to the Lethbridge police website, including using his position to his personal advantage and discrediting the reputation of the police service. He is being demoted two grades to a Constable Level 1 for two years. Carrier was found guilty of two counts, including neglecting his duties as a police officer, and is being demoted one grade to Senior Constable, Level 2, for one year.  Both demotions also mean a temporary reduction in pay."

Whether the federal government will heed that call is the subject of much debate and speculation, even within the ranks of the 67 members of Parliament who signed Tuesday’s letter urging action. The letter calls for Magnitsky legislation to be brought against China’s officials complicit in human rights “atrocities” in Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong. “As a leader on the international human rights discussion, to invoke Magnitsky sanctions against these officials is a strong and symbolic action that is consistent with how Canada has applied this act in the past,” reads the letter.  So-called Magnitsky legislation allows for Canada to impose sanctions, economic or otherwise, against specific people or organizations known to be responsible for human rights violations or corruption in other countries. Liberal MP John McKay pointed to recent actions Canada has taken by Ottawa over the new national security law in China, which include suspending an extradition treaty with Hong Kong and restrictions on certain “sensitive” exports to the region, as examples of a different attitude in Ottawa. “I think it’s an increasing possibility,” he said of sanctions. “I think the progress has been quite rapid in terms of a changing attitude.”  McKay said he thinks speaking out on the China issue has been welcomed by many in his party.  But a fellow signatory, Conservative MP Kenny Chiu, is much less optimistic, arguing Ottawa’s stance on the issue has been weak. “I have seen to date just a bunch of lip service, posturing and I have not seen much of any action,” he said. While he agrees with actions taken regarding Hong Kong after the national security law was brought in, the measures are “defensive” in nature and don’t go far enough, he said.  Chiu said sanctions on Chinese Communist Party officials could affect those with ties to Canada, and prevent them from freely coming to the country or doing business here could have an impact.  The government’s previous action on the issue doesn’t give him much hope sanctions are coming, Chiu said. Last week, Canada’s minister of global affairs, François-Philippe Champagne, suggested Canada was considering such sanctions against some mainland China officials in response to human rights abuses in the country, particularly in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. “Yes, we are considering all the options when it comes to standing up for human rights,” Champagne told the House of Commons in response to questions about whether the government would consider such sanctions. Later in the week, a Reuters story quoted a government source as saying Ottawa was not actually considering the sanctions.  The new calls for human rights sanctions increased recently after paper by academic Adrian Zenz released via the Washington, D.C.-based Jamestown Foundation using Chinese government documents reported forced sterilization was being practised in Xinjiang against its ethnic Uighur population. Such acts are considered genocide according to the United Nations convention addressing such crimes. Meanwhile, critics also say Canada hasn’t taken enough action to support pro-democracy efforts in Hong Kong, which was recently brought further under Beijing’s control with the imposition of a new national security law that opponents say breaches the British-Chinese joint declaration. The declaration is the document laying out the conditions of Hong Kong’s takeover by China, which occurred in 1997; part of it stipulated Hong Kong would enjoy relative autonomy until 2047.  Cherie Wong of the pro-democracy group Alliance Canada Hong Kong, which is a signatory to the letter, said the “inaction” by Ottawa amounts to flip-flopping. “We at Alliance Canada Hong Kong (ACHK) are frustrated with the deliberate inaction,” Wong said in an email. International human rights lawyer David Matas told the Star such sanctions pressure those involved personally in human rights abuses rather than just make a widespread condemnation of a government. “What Magnitsky legislation does is it puts a name and a face to violations,” Matas said. “It’s an attribution of responsibility.”  Such sanctions could include freezing assets, barring those sanctioned from coming to Canada or even opening them up to prosecution should they arrive here, he said.  Last week, the United States named several people and one organization related to human rights abuses in China for sanctions.  Meanwhile, regardless of the likelihood of Canada imposing such sanctions, Chiu and McKay both want to see them introduced. “The question after that is what’s the reaction of the government of China to the naming of individual human rights abusers,” he McKay said. “We’ll see.” "

Provincial police spokeswoman Sgt. Ann Mathieu says officers on the ground and in the air are concentrating on a 50-square-kilometre area around St-Apollinaire, Que., where the bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and six, were located. The girls had last been seen Wednesday and became the subject of an Amber Alert the next day. Police have said they and their father, Martin Carpentier, are believed to have been in a serious crash on Highway 20 in St-Apollinaire on Wednesday evening at about 9:30 p.m. But police say they did not find any occupants inside the car when they arrived on scene. They say they have found “pertinent elements” in the area on Sunday that were sent to a laboratory for analysis to see if they are linked to Carpentier. Police did not specify what the items were, but as the search entered its sixth day, police have raised the possibility Carpentier could be unconscious or dead. Mathieu said it also cannot be ruled out that he remains alive. “You know that someone who is healthy, someone who is mobile, can easily move by walking several kilometres a day,” she told reporters. “We also have to consider that he could have found a means of transport, something as simple as a bicycle.” She said the area being searched was delineated based on reports from the public, and she urged people to remain on the lookout for Carpentier."

Finance Minister Carole James said the numbers are staggering with job losses of 235,000 since February and a predicted GDP decline of 6.8 per cent by the end of this year. “We were preparing for economic moderation, we were well-equipped to be able to weather the challenges,” James said at a news conference Tuesday. “What came next was unprecedented. Mere weeks after Budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed.” The government has provided $6.26 billion in financial aid to businesses and individuals. Among the losses it anticipates this fiscal year because of the pandemic are close to $1 billion in personal income tax, $973 million in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax, James said. The projected GDP decline in 2020 would be the worst on record going back to the 1980s, although it is also projected to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2021. James said for context, B.C.’s real GDP has only declined twice in the past 40 years, falling by 2.4 per cent in 2009 and 6.4 per cent in 1982. “As those numbers remind us, this could be the worst downturn experienced in our province recent history,” she said. B.C.’s restart plan is showing signs of hope for the economy as consumer confidence increases, she said. The unemployment rate is slowly rebounding and fewer wildfires and floods have helped the bottom line. However, she warned that the province’s financial forecast could change depending on many risk factors, including the possibility of a second wave of infections, the possibility of a vaccine, as well as the success of relief measures and central bank policy. Regardless of how B.C. copes with the pandemic, James said its economy is also subject to the economic health of other jurisdictions, particularly those that buy from the province. James said it wouldn’t help the economic recovery to pull back on spending, but the government will review every cent spent as it heads into the next budget year. The B.C. government has tabled legislation giving itself room for three years of deficits, which James said will be re-examined each year. James said she believes people care about provincial deficits because they understand it’s taxpayer money, but they also understand the emergency the pandemic created. She declined to predict how long the recovery would take, given the many moving pieces at play. “There is no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the economy of British Columbia and that’s not short term,” she said. The job losses have been widespread but some have been disproportionately affected, depending on a worker’s age, gender or which sector they work in, James said. Young workers are among the hardest hit, with the unemployment rate rising sharply from 9.1 per cent in February to 29.1 per cent in June for those aged 15 to 24. Women, who dominate the service industries and many of whom have also left jobs to care for family members, are another group more affected. Their unemployment rate rose from 4.8 per cent in February to 13.4 per cent in June. The hardest hit industries include wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services, construction, culture and recreation. The overall unemployment rate of 13 per cent remains at its highest level since 1987. While the job losses in March and April were record breaking, the figures for May and June have seen modest recovery as the economy started to reopen. “The projected numbers are staggering but they’re not without hope. Things are getting better each and every day when we follow the provincial health officer’s advice,” James said. The NDP government’s fiscal update was met with calls for an economic recovery plan by its political opponents, with the Opposition B.C. Liberals asking what happens when federal benefits like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit run out. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson also suggested the government should reconsider its pre-pandemic spending priorities. “People in every corner of B.C. have had to adjust to a new normal and adapt their household budgets, so why is this government pretending it’s business as usual?” he asked in a statement. The Green party said the province should transition to a green economy by helping traditional industries become more sustainable, spending on training and building local businesses into the supply chain. “We can seize the once in a generation opportunity to strategically drive stimulus spending toward a future British Columbians want: an innovative, low-carbon, sustainable, just and inclusive economy for all,” interim leader Adam Olsen said."

It is just the latest twist in Mohamed Mahjoub’s two-decade legal odyssey. The government is trying to remove Mahjoub, 60, using a national security certificate, claiming he was a high-ranking member of a terrorist organization. Security certificates are rarely used federal tools for removing foreign nationals suspected of links to terrorist activity or espionage. Mahjoub, married with three children, came to Canada in 1995 and attained refugee status. He once worked as deputy general manager of a farm project in Sudan run by Osama bin Laden, who would later spearhead the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Mahjoub was arrested under a security certificate in June 2000 after being interviewed by Canada’s spy agency on six occasions between August 1997 and March 1999. Each time, he denied any involvement in extremism. The Supreme Court of Canada struck down the certificate regime as unconstitutional, but the government revamped the process and issued a new certificate against Mahjoub in 2009. It has subsequently been affirmed by the courts. In January, federal officials gave Mahjoub the results of two assessments — one examining the nature and severity of his acts, the other looking at the risks he might face upon removal from Canada. A designated government official will review the assessments in deciding whether Mahjoub should be deported. But before that happens, Mahjoub wants to see all the information underpinning the assessments. Last month the Canada Border Services Agency told Mahjoub and his lawyers it would not disclose “any of the requested documents or provide any further information,” says his recent filing in the Federal Court of Canada. The information is important because, if deported, Mahjoub would be sent to Egypt, “a country where he is likely to face persecution, torture and possible death,” the filing says. The severity of the potential consequences mean Mahjoub is entitled to see “all relevant information,” whether the government intends to rely on it or not, given the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, his submission says. In addition, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms requires the government to disclose any information related to proceedings that have potentially severe effects on Mahjoub’s life, liberty and security, it adds.

The Ontario Council of Hospital Unions, a division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, says it’s pushing back against the province’s emergency order because it suspends their collective bargaining agreement. Union president Michael Hurley says his members are going to start by sending their MPPs emails this week, explaining how the order damages their workplace rights. The union says it’s also planning legal challenges and will hold rallies outside of its workplaces on Friday. Members of the union will vote on Monday night to see if it will be necessary to have a brief work stoppage the next day. Hurley says that while the emergency orders were acceptable in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s now a detriment to health-care workers and the emergency is over in most of the province. A spokeswoman for the union confirmed on Monday that 98 per cent of its membership voted in favour of political action over the weekend. Hurley says that his members are “angry” and will be holding a series of news conferences in Hamilton, Sudbury, Ottawa and Toronto this week to bring attention to the issues at the community level. The Progressive Conservative government introduced a bill last week that would allow it to keep some emergency measures in place in the months ahead. Hurley said the suspended agreement means hospital staff may have their shifts changed, be moved from site to site, or have vacation requests denied."

Given current COVID-19 trends, the private child-care operators say they can do so safely — and save their centres at the same time. “We need your help to urge the government to allow child-care centres to open safely at full capacity so we can provide child care for parents going back to work and who have nowhere else to turn,” says their website and petition at saveourspaces.ca. “Operating at partial capacity simply isn’t sustainable for the long term, especially with arbitrary direction and little to no financial support from the government. Reopening the economy requires safe and available child care for all.” The group of six female operators, calling themselves Concerned Childcare Providers, say the government’s announcement Monday to boost the “cohort” or grouping numbers to 15 later this month as the province moves into Stage 3 still means fewer spaces for families. “We would like the government to understand that for many the economics of operating child-care facilities at a reduced capacity after months of closures — with little to no financial support from the government — simply does not work, risking the closure and loss of thousands of spaces,” they said. Deborah Renwick opened Ellington Montessori School in Scarborough in 1990, but “when COVID-19 hit, it was unlike anything I had ever experienced in my 30 years of operating this centre.” She had to cover $22,000 in monthly rent, with no parent fees coming in with the shutdown. “Now, I have to close my doors for good,” she said. “I can only hope that others don’t have to resort to this as well.” Leigh Anne Jacques, an owner of Beaches Montessori School, opened the centre three years ago. Shut down because of the pandemic, it just opened up for summer camp, with about 18 students — although capacity is 62. “Since the government has allowed for child-care spaces to open at partial capacity, we decided we had to open our doors — even if it meant at a smaller capacity and at financial loss.… We knew how important it was for parents to have a safe, reliable place to take their kids every day,” she said. In the legislature Tuesday, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath grilled the government about the move to reopen to Stage 3. “Unfortunately, the Conservatives’ refusal to include a province-wide plan for child-care and education is going to make life even harder for workers and business owners in every corner of our province because it’s going to make it next to impossible for working parents to get back to work. Does the premier accept the reality that Ontario won’t be able to get back to work if working moms and dads can’t rely on schools and available child-care spaces?” Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the province will “ensure child care remains sustainable and accessible in every community in this province” and is working closely with the medical officer of health to do so. The NDP also released an emergency plan for back-to-school, which includes “funding to help keep the child-care sector afloat” and using “public infrastructure to support the reopening of schools and daycares” with additional space to allow for physical distancing. Carolyn Ferns, of the Ontario Coalition for Better Child Care, said there are still some questions about the new 15-cohort rule, but said overall the situation “has definitely been a challenge for child-care centres — non-profit and for-profit.” But she said reopening must be guided only by what is best for young children’s health and safety. Many critics have noted that without enough child-care spaces — and even pre-pandemic, there was a shortfall — parents, mostly women, can’t re-enter the workforce. “Women are disproportionately affected by this. It’s not right that a mom should have to pick between having a child and having a job,” said Jacques. Parents, she added, “are looking for more certainty … parents are anxious and our staff are anxious. Part of that is living in a pandemic, and part of it is that we are unable to provide them with a plan.” Every day at Beaches Montessori, kids and staff are screened, including temperature checks, before they are allowed in. “We have worked hard to ensure that our centre is safe. Parents have to wear masks at pickup and drop-off. We have a screener at the entrance wearing PPE and helping us with sanitizing,” said Jacques. “We are working diligently to help support our community. But the time has come that we need some help, too. We can’t sustain operating at a loss forever.”"

Historians estimate that as many as 40,000 people found freedom on the west bank of the Niagara River, escaping from slavery in the American South and fleeing to Canada. Local towns all supported substantial populations of escaped slaves and their families throughout the 19th century. The Freedom Trail is an initiative begun by their descendants who stayed on for generations in the land where they first found freedom. St. Catharines: The Salem Chapel On the fringe of downtown St. Catharines you will find one of the most significant monuments of black history in Canada, the Salem Chapel of the British Methodist Episcopal (BME) Church, built by former slaves and still a thriving hub for the surviving community of their descendants. This is where legendary Underground Railroad conductor Harriet Tubman worshipped during the 1850s and planned the daring raids that brought so many more people north to freedom. “I brought them all clear off to Canada,” she famously declared, and the first stop was always this neighbourhood in St. Catharines. The existing 1853 chapel, the third one the congregation built on this site, is the oldest surviving Black church in Ontario. Niagara-on-the-Lake: Parliament Oak School It was a U.S. bounty hunter snatching back a freed Black woman in Niagara and returning her to slavery that inspired Upper Canada’s first Governor General, John Graves Simcoe, to write his 1793 Act Against Slavery. Simcoe hoped to eliminate slavery in the new colony, but the fact that so many of his colleagues owned slaves forced him to compromise: keeping the existing slaves in chains while banning the creation of more. It was still the first act of its kind in a British colony. You can find a dignified memorial limestone bas-relief on the wall of Parliament Oak School at 325 King Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake, believed to be the site of the colony’s first parliament, where the act was passed. Harriet Tubman’s Historic Crossing into Canada In June 2017 the Niagara Parks Commission unveiled a interpretive plaque commemorating Harriet Tubman’s first crossing into Canada in 1856. She crossed on a suspension bridge near the current Whirlpool Bridge Plaza along the Niagara Parkway north of the falls. Students from nearby schools petitioned for the plaque which details Tubman’s life from her time as a slave in Maryland to her escape to freedom in Canada. Bertie Hall Thirty kilometres south on the Niagara Parkway is the handsome Bertie Hall, an imposing Greek revival mansion that was used as a warehouse for trade goods in the early 19th century — and also as a safe house where newly escaped slaves could hide while U.S. bounty hunters searched for them. A plaque on the grounds details the history of the building and its role in the Underground Railroad. A descent into the basement shows where the runaways hid. The Crossing The Crossing at Fort Erie marks the spot where thousands of fugitives first set foot in Canada. Former Maryland slave Josiah Henson, who escaped in 1830 and became a pioneer community builder in Upper Canada, described how “the riotous exultation” of his feelings upon first landing here caused him to fall to the ground and “to execute sundry antics which excited the astonishment of those who were looking on.” They thought he was suffering from a seizure. But no, Henson explained, it was his first intoxicating experience of freedom that caused his “fit” of happiness. You can find a plaque marking the Crossing in the aptly named Freedom Park at the foot of Bertie Street on the Fort Erie waterfront."

The survey, conducted by Campaign Research for the Star, found that just 13 per cent of those polled thought tuition should remain the same. “I think everybody is looking for a bit of a discount,” said Campaign Research principal Nick Kouvalis. It’s partly a reflection of how people feel about online learning, he said, and “if people think they are not going to get the full experience” of being on campus, spending thousands on tuition doesn’t sit well. A number of student groups have also been pushing for a break on tuition for this fall. Campaign Research polled 1,434 people across Ontario last week, using the Maru Blue opt-in online panel. The equivalent margin of error for a random sample of the same size is plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The survey found the public is split on universities offering in-person classes this fall, with just over one-third supporting the move and 31 per cent opposing it. The remaining third were unsure. However, if classes were smaller, some 67 per cent of respondents feel it would be safe for students to be learning on campus. But when it comes to living on campus, just 27 per cent of those surveyed said it is safe to reopen residences, with 39 per cent saying it’s not. However, if universities only allow for one student per room, 55 per cent agree residences could safely operate this fall. About 50 per cent of respondents felt January 2021 to the best time to reopen residences. Some Ontario colleges and universities are planning for online-only learning this fall, with others promising a hybrid of remote and in-class sessions where possible. Some have closed residences or are planning for one to two students per room depending on the size of the space. Last month, the province announced a summer pilot project allowing post-secondary institutions to partially open their campuses to allow “academically stranded” students to complete lessons or labs they missed during the COVID-19 shutdown. Schools across the province — including all 24 public colleges — are taking part in the pilot, targeted at students studying health care, nursing or the trades, which call for practical, hands-on experience to graduate. Colleges and Universities Minister Ross Romano said the pilot will help guide schools as they plan to reopen safely this fall."

A microbiologist on the risks of indoor drinking,['Karon LiuCulture Reporter'],"Tue., July 14, 2020","As large swaths of Ontario move to Stage 3 of reopening this Friday (Toronto not included), bars and restaurants will be allowed to offer dine-in service in addition to takeout and outdoor dining. But just because they’ll be open, it doesn’t mean the pandemic is over. So is it safe to go to the corner pub for a burger and a pint, or is it better to continue with takeout? Dasantila Golemi-Kotra, a microbiologist and associate professor at York University, said that for the time being, she’ll continue getting takeout and cook at home. “It seems that the conditions this virus thrives on is in confined areas with proximity to others,” she said. “Bars and restaurants meet all those requirements. We spend time leisurely there, and you find yourself talking louder to compete with the music and other people. Studies have shown that respiratory droplets are released as you talk and the virus persists even in the smallest drops.” The rule laid out by the province so far is that indoor gatherings, such as in restaurants and bars, need at least two metres of space between patrons from different households and social bubbles, unless there’s a barrier like a Plexiglas shield. There’s a maximum indoor gathering limit of 50, guests have to remain seated and buffets are still a no-go. Golemi-Kotra added that respiratory particles can travel beyond six feet within a confined space with poor air circulation, which is why she said patio dining has worked relatively well so far. Alcohol can also make a person more relaxed about social distancing guidelines. Patrons also can’t wear a mask when eating or drinking. Another risk is restrooms. And while the risk of contamination is small, there are surfaces touched by many people and the ventilation isn’t the best.  For those that absolutely must head to a bar or restaurant, Golemi-Kotra still recommends the patio or takeout.  For dining-in, she said to restrict the tables to people from the same household. “If you must dine with your social bubble be strict about it, dine with the people that you share the same health and safety concerns and lifestyle as. Be mindful that asymptomatic people are responsible for as much as 40 per cent of the SARS-CoV-2 spread.”  Keep the dining and drinking sessions short, exercise good hygiene and don’t share food or utensils, she added. Still, even then, she said there’s still a risk of infection as cases have spiked in cities that already reopened bars and restaurants. B.C. health officials issued a warning after eight people who tested positive for COVID-19 had visited downtown Kelowna and the city’s waterfront between June 25 and July 9. Montreal health authorities also told people to get tested after 13 patrons tested positive and visited at least nine bars since July 1. Last month in Michigan, more than 100 COVID-19 cases were traced back to a single bar. On Monday, just after Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced the province’s Stage 3 plans, California’s governor closed all bars and indoor restaurants for a second time as COVID-19 cases continued to rise.  Councillor Joe Cressy, chair of the Toronto Board of Health, told the Star on Monday that the city needs to be “extremely cautious” when it comes to reopening bars in indoor settings and monitor other jurisdictions around the world to see how they’re handling indoor drinking. “I’m happy that the numbers in Ontario are (low) but people tend to forget that we’re doing well because we’re staying home,” Golemi-Kotra said. That’s why we have to be careful or else the numbers will go up again.”"

The Lavazza Drive-In Film Festival, running July 20 to 31, will screen 12 movies from countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic at Ontario Place. It’s a partnership with the Italian Embassy, with a portion of ticket sales donated to the Canadian Red Cross.  It opens with the Toronto debut of Canadian indie film “The Cuban,” starring Oscar winner Louis Gossett Jr., and closes with the Canadian premiere of Italian drama “If Only/Magari.”  Other titles include the U.K. comedy “Fisherman’s Friends”; crime thriller “Sheep Without a Shepherd” from China; Brazilian football dramedy “Back to Maracana”; family-friendly “Spread Your Wings” from France; Second World War movie “T-34” from Russia; Indian comedy “Bala”; “ The Peanut Butter Falcon” from the U.S.; and the Italian movies “Tomorrow’s a New Day,” “If You Love Me” and “I Hate Summer.”  See icff.ca for information.  Lori Loughlin, husband ‘respectfully’ seek bail cut  Lori Loughlin and husband Mossimo Giannulli, who pleaded guilty in the nation’s college admissions scandal, want to get a better deal on their $1 million bail, and federal prosecutors in Boston are OK with it.  The couple are scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 21 on conspiracy charges in their alleged efforts to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California. On Monday in Boston, they filed a motion asking “respectfully” for the court to release their $1-million-US bonds secured by their property, reducing their bail to $100,000, and lift the requirement that the $100,000 bonds also be secured by money or property.  “The Government assents to the relief sought in this motion,” the couple’s team of lawyers wrote in their motion. After asserting their innocence for more than a year, Loughlin and Giannulli reversed course on May 22, formally pleading guilty to one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud, in separate plea agreements with federal prosecutors.  If the couple’s sentences from their deals are accepted by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton, Loughlin will serve two months in prison, pay a fine of $150,000, serve two years of supervised release and undertake 100 hours of community service. Giannulli would serve five months in prison, pay a $250,000 fine and have two years of supervised release with 250 hours of community service.  Tom Bergeron, Erin Andrews exit ‘Dancing With the Stars’ The dance has ended for “Dancing With the Stars” hosts Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews.  ABC said in a statement that the show is looking to “embark on a new creative direction” and host Bergeron “departs the show with our sincerest thanks and gratitude for his trademark wit and charm that helped make this show a success.” No replacements were named; Andrews originally competed as a contestant back in 2010 and returned as co-host in 2014, while Bergeron has hosted since its premiere in 2005.  He took to Twitter to announce his departure. “It’s been an incredible 15-year run and the most unexpected gift of my career,” he wrote. “I’m grateful for that and for the lifelong friendships made.”  Last year, Bergeron made waves when he expressed his unhappiness that former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was among the contestants for the fall season. Bergeron tweeted that he earlier told producers he hoped the new season would be a “joyful respite from our exhausting political climate” and urged them not have any “divisive bookings.”  The network on Monday also said farewell to “Her signature sense of humour has become a hallmark of the show,” the statement read.  Pop Smoke and ‘Hamilton’ Shake Up the Billboard Chart The posthumous debut album by Brooklyn rapper Pop Smoke, who was shot and killed in February, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart this week, arriving as one of the biggest releases of a slow summer in the music business, one of countless industries greatly affected by the coronavirus pandemic.  “Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon,” Pop Smoke’s third career release after two mixtapes, had the largest opening week since Lady Gaga’s “Chromatica” in early June, earning the equivalent of 251,000 albums sold, factoring in both streaming and traditional sales. Songs from the album were streamed 268 million times — the fourth-best streaming week of the year — while bundles of the music and merchandise helped lead to 59,000 units in sales, according to Nielsen.  Pop Smoke, born Bashar Jackson, was killed during a home invasion in the Hollywood Hills section of Los Angeles, interrupting his meteoric mainstream rise from the streets of Canarsie, Brooklyn, New York, where he was at the forefront of the bubbling drill scene. Last week, the Los Angeles Police Department arrested five men in connection with the crime.  In the No. 2 spot this week is the original Broadway cast recording of “Hamilton,” which reached its highest chart placement in its 250th week on Billboard, surging nearly 300% thanks to the July 3 streaming premiere of the filmed version of the show on Disney+. The cast album, released in September 2015, previously peaked at No. 3 on the chart in 2016, following its 11 wins at that year’s Tony Awards. This time, songs from “Hamilton” were streamed 90 million times — a record for cast recordings — and the album sold 32,000 units, for a one-week total of 102,000.  The arrival of Pop Smoke and the resurgence of “Hamilton” bumped rapper Lil Baby’s “My Turn,” which sat at No. 1 for the past four weeks in lieu of major new releases, to No. 3 in its 19th week on the chart. “Blame It on Baby” by DaBaby fell one spot to No. 4, while Post Malone’s “Hollywood’s Bleeding” landed at No. 5.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said there were 111 new cases reported Tuesday morning, with one death. “Locally, 28 of Ontario’s 34 public health units are reporting five or fewer cases, with fully 21 of them reporting no new cases at all,” Elliott said on Twitter. “With 122 more resolved, there are 11 fewer active cases in the province.” There are 137 patients in hospital with COVID-19 with 39 in intensive care units. Of those, 21 are on ventilators. Most of Ontario — excluding the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and parts of the southwest — will enter the third stage Friday, meaning restaurants and bars can serve meals indoors and gyms can reopen as long as physical distancing is maintained. Queen’s Park says 2,723 people have died from the virus since the pandemic struck in March, but the Star has determined there have been 2,761 coronavirus deaths in Ontario. That difference of 38 fatalities is because some were not included were not included early in the outbreak since COVID-19 tests had not been conducted before those people — most of whom were elderly residents of long-term-care homes — died. The government says there have been 36,950 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario. As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, a Star survey of Ontario’s regional health units found a total of 38,966 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19. Over the last week, the province’s 34 health units have reported an average of 127 new infections per day — well down from a sustained peak of nearly 600 cases per day, seen in late April. Tuesday’s 5 p.m. total, up 91 cases in 24 hours, did not include any new reports from Toronto, which has switched to updating just three days a week. The Star’s tally includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, which means they have symptoms, travel history or contacts that indicate they likely have the disease, but haven’t yet received a positive test from a lab."

Adrian Dix said during a news conference Monday that warnings of possible exposures at a restaurant, spin studio, bed and breakfast and resort are believed to stem from “private parties” at the hotels. Eight positive tests for the disease are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city’s waterfront between June 25 and July 9, said an email from Interior Health, the regional health authority. “When people come together for private parties — in this case it was primarily people in their 20s and 30s — the risks are considerably higher,” Dix said. The exposures follow the move to a new phase of reopening in B.C. that allows for tourism within the province. Although the accommodation industry was not ordered to close during the pandemic, many operators did so voluntarily but began welcoming guests again as part of the new phase. Infections in B.C. inched up on Monday as health officials announced 62 new cases since Friday. Two more people also died for a total of 189 deaths in B.C. The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 3,115, while 2,718 people have fully recovered from COVID-19. Interior Health also issued an isolation order for Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver after two positive tests associated with the farm. Public health officials are monitoring the situation and placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm, the government said in a news release. The cases linked to Kelowna involved people who live in three regions of the province, including the Interior, Fraser and Vancouver Coastal Health regions, said Dix. He credited contact tracers with making the connections. He said the tourism industry has done a good job of creating safe environments for guests, but it’s also up to guests to ensure they respect physical distancing guidelines and group size limitations. “Whether it’s a trip or a party at home, the same risks and the same rules apply,” Dix said. If you’re gathering with friends and family, you should consider the increased risk that indoor locations pose and determine how many people can maintain a safe distance accordingly, he said. “We have got to live with COVID-19 for the next year so that means the responsibility is on all of us to understand the risks and understand our responsibilities to one another.” Interior Health issued an exposure advisory for the resort and bed and breakfast on Friday and added the restaurant and spin studio in a statement on Sunday. Visitors to the Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 or the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to July 5 were advised to self-isolate and monitor themselves closely for symptoms. The health authority is now urging visitors to Kelowna’s Cactus Club restaurant on Water Street between July 3 and July 6, or the Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 to self-monitor and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms appear. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control also warns that a case or cases were confirmed on an Air Canada flight from Kelowna to Vancouver on July 6, but Dix could not say if that warning was linked. Public health contact tracing is underway and the health authority said it’s reaching out directly to anyone who has been exposed, where possible. Testing is recommended for anyone with novel coronavirus symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or a loss of taste or smell, said Interior Health. “Milder symptoms may include runny nose, fatigue, body aches ... diarrhea, headache, sore throat, vomiting and red eyes,” it said in a statement. Anyone with even mild symptoms is urged to stay home and avoid travel. Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 include physical distancing, regular hand washing, not touching the face and avoiding gatherings of more than 50 people, the health authority said."

Indigenous groups share impact of border closures,['Nick WellsThe Canadian Press'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","Indigenous bands along the west coast of British Columbia say their borders will remain closed to tourists and non-residents, despite the economic impact, as they work to raise awareness about the threat COVID-19 poses to their communities. The Nuu-chah-nulth, the Heiltsuk Nation and the Haida Nation have all closed or restricted access to their territories and reserves. “Of course it’s negatively impacting. But our directors have said, our chiefs have said, people before economics,” said Judith Sayers, the president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, in an interview. “I think everyone is slowly realizing the impact economically, but right now we just really feel that we want to protect the members first.” Members of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, made up of 14 First Nations along the west coast of Vancouver Island, have deployed a variety of tactics to help ensure their borders are kept sealed from non-residents. Members of the Ahousaht First Nation, who live in the remote area of Flores Island, have deputized citizens to act as peacekeeping officers, Sayers said. The Ahousaht issued a notice on July 2 that their territory, which covers a large area of land and water north of Tofino, B.C., including provincial parks, will remain closed to tourists and non-residents as there “is still no vaccine, no antiserum and no cure for COVID-19.” Others, like the Tla-o-qui-aht in Tofino, stopped cars in an effort to convince them to turn around. The concern, Sayers says, lies in the ability to test and contain any potential COVID-19 outbreak. “A lot of our communities are remote and testing is not easily available,” she said. “If you’re in Port Alberni, or Nanaimo, or Victoria, or somewhere (else), you can get testing and get results in 24 hours. It’s not the same with our communities.” The closures have resulted in disputes between Indigenous groups and local businesses. The Haida Nation in Haida Gwaii have turned away non-residents at the ferry terminal, discouraged leisure travel and called on two local fishing lodges to rethink their reopening plans. “We’re such a close-knit community, I think that once we get a case of COVID, I think that it’ll spread like wildfire,” said Duffy Edgars, the Chief Councillor of the Old Massett Village Council in Haida Gwaii. Edgars said many local fishing lodges are respecting the Haida Nation’s state of emergency, but is frustrated by others who want to open up. “It’s disrespectful,” he said. “These bigger (lodges) are coming in and just doing whatever they want.” Leaders and representatives from the Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk and Haida all say they would like to see more co-operation from the provincial government in working with Indigenous communities. “It’s really frustrating,” said Marilyn Slett, the chief councillor of the Heiltsuk. “We have a limited amount of time here, we think, before that anticipated second or third wave so right now is the time for us to be sitting down and having those discussions so going forward we’re all working collaboratively together.” Part of the issue, she says, lies in B.C. politicians encouraging residents to take part in interprovincial tourism. “We’re seeing a lot more vessel traffic on the coast, we’re seeing a lot more recreational boaters, and that’s a really high concern for our community,” said Slett. The closures — many of which began in March — have been felt at a variety of levels. The pandemic forced the cancellation of the Heiltsuk’s Spawn-on-Kelp fishery this year, an event Slett says employs 700 people and is a hugely important economic driver for the community. “Certainly our community put forward the health and safety before the economic driver,” she said. “So our community has been hit hard.” Sayers says when the pandemic first broke out and restrictions were placed on communities, First Nations were bringing in food for members so they didn’t have to leave their reserves and face possible exposure at grocery stores. The Heiltsuk, Nuu-chah-Nulth and the Tsilhqot’in issued a statement in late June, criticizing the provincial government’s reopening plan and what they saw as a lack of dialogue with First Nations groups. All three want the province to commit to four conditions which would allow border restrictions being lifted: COVID-19 information sharing, screening, rapid testing and culturally-safe contract tracing teams. Until those are met, Slett says, she can’t see Indigenous communities fully opening their borders. But the provincial government says it is committed to working with Indigenous communities. “Many tourist-depending communities are now safely welcoming the gradual return of out-of-town visitors,” said Sarah Plank, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “At the same time, we acknowledge some smaller and more remote communities and First Nations continue to be concerned about visitors to their communities.” The government is also working on scheduling a meeting with the Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsilquot’in, Heiltsuk and Haida Nations and other communities, she added."

The world chipped in,"['Rochelle Baker , National Observer']","Sun., July 12, 2020","It’s a thoroughly unromantic name. Lot 302. Yet the 20-acre parcel of timber symbolizes the achievement and ongoing battle by a tiny coastal community to protect as much mature forest as they can on their remote B.C. island. “We just couldn’t bear to see yet another clearcut,” said Read Island resident Lannie Keller of the Surge Narrows community, which managed to raise $150,000 inside of four months to protect 20 acres of forest earlier this year. And the community is working to buy another parcel with an important riparian zone to complement their recent acquisition and further protect Read Island’s ecologically sensitive areas. This time, it’s a spot where the forest intersects with streams and swampy areas critical to salmon and amphibian habitat. “There is a remaining 128 acres of wetland and mature trees in the middle of the island, which would extend our protected area in a lovely and significant way,” said Lannie, who along with husband Ralph, sparked the community’s most recent efforts to conserve their forests. Approximately 80 residents live full time on Read Island — one of several “outer islands” wedged between Vancouver Island and the B.C. coast in the northern reaches of the Straight of Georgia — which is only accessible by boat or float plane. And the community of Surge Narrows — which boasts not much more than a public dock, a small post office, a small school, a community hall, and an abandoned, ramshackle clapboard store — is tucked into Read Island’s northwest flank. Despite its small size, Surge Narrows acts as a community hub for Read Island, as well as for residents of surrounding Maurelle, North and South Rendezvous, and Sonora islands. So when nearby Lot 302 went up for sale last summer, and the Kellers heard the mixed mature forest was drawing the interest of a logging company, the couple knew they had to act fast. “It was a beautiful piece of treed land along the main road where people travel to get mail, to the school or the dock,” Lannie said. The parcel was also adjacent to the island’s John Kim Ecological Sanctuary and would create a green corridor from the Surge Narrows dock to the boundary of the island’s existing Fish and Forest Reserve at the headwaters of two important salmon streams, Ralph added. “We thought, ‘Oh man, we better do something right now,’ so we went back and wrote them a cheque,” Lannie said. Lot 302’s owners, long-term residents, were willing to sell the land to the community at a reduced price. So the Kellers, through their local kayaking business, Coast Mountain Expeditions, offered a $50,000 down payment and guaranteed the entire $150,000 purchase price if the community decided not to come on board. But the community was all in. The Kellers presented the idea to the Surge Narrows Community Association (SNCA), representing about 130 permanent residents on the surrounding isles. “The response was super enthusiastic,” said Lannie, who wasn’t surprised by the tight-knit community’s response, but rather by the speed at which the remaining funds were raised. “We were astounded. It just happened so fast,” Lannie said, adding the community, which doesn’t have deep pockets, gave generously. “Sometimes it was to the point where we said, ‘You can’t do that. You don’t have that much to give,’” said Lannie, noting one resident was donating half her limited pension to the project. But what really shocked the community was the response from the outside world, the Kellers said. “The funding came from near and far,” said Lannie, adding people donated from across Canada and even internationally. “Some had distant links to Read Island, but some had absolutely no connection at all but said (forest conservation) resonated with them.” Protecting remaining intact forests strikes a deep chord with people around the globe, Ralph said. “Most people today love living forests. The wilderness and the feeling they exude,” he said. “As soon as you clear-cut it, lay it all to waste and destroy the wildlife habitat, nesting sites and the wetlands, it threatens us personally. Whether it’s British Columbia or Brazil, a clearcut has become the international symbol of the destruction of the environment.” Read Island, like most of British Columbia, has a long, history with clearcut logging, Ralph added, noting the practice is ongoing on the island’s woodlots. In the mid-1980s, just a couple of years after the couple arrived on the island, 1,200 acres of mature low-elevation rainforest was razed to the ground, he said. “To be able look across the island for several kilometres and not see a single tree was pretty impactful for all of us,” Ralph said. It led to the community working together for the first time in 1992 to purchase a lot from Raven Forest Products to create the island’s first reserve to try to protect the salmon streams. But in that instance, the effort took three years to raise $78,000 for the 20-acre lot, Lannie said, adding people had relatives’ kids knocking on doors in Vancouver for spare change. “We were exhausted afterwards,” she said. But this last time around, an international conservation organization arrived on Read in February to explore whether it would back the purchase of Lot 302, only to find the fundraising was already done, Lannie said. Now, the Germany-based Wilderness International is partnering with the Surge Narrows community to provide the bulk of the funds to try to purchase the wetland Lot 309, Ralph said. Wilderness International has promised $150,000 to help the SNCA purchase the lot, said David MacDonald, Canadian director with the organization. “We’re waiting on the decision of the landowner, after which we’ll draw up a co-operative agreement,” he said. Wilderness International purchases private lands with intact rainforest to protect biodiversity and capture carbon dioxide to prevent climate change, he said. German society is passionate about protecting the world’s forests because they have so little of their own wilderness left, MacDonald added. Aside from occasional visits from biologists or student groups to study the ecosystems at their sites, not much else will happen other than the foundation paying taxes in perpetuity, he said. “Essentially, the concept is: We buy the forests and leave them alone.” The Kellers said the Surge Narrows community is also waiting to hear from the landowner to move forward. “We’re all waiting with bated breath,” Lannie said. With the experience gained through their kayaking company, they know the wilderness on and around Read Island is precious, the Kellers said. “This environment is so incredible, and we’ve had thousands of people visit from all over the world over the years. And they’ve said they’ve never been anywhere so beautiful,” Lannie said. “It’s special, and it deserves protection.”"
21,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/sports/hockey/2020/07/11/flames-travis-hamonic-is-first-player-to-opt-out-of-nhl-return.html,"Opting out: Hamonic, Baertschi, Polak, Green, Alzner, Kampfer pass on NHL restart",['Stephen WhynoThe Associated Press'],"Sat., July 11, 2020","Roman Polak of the Stars and Mike Green of the Oilers are among the players who have opted out for the resumption of the NHL season. In the aftermath of a deal being struck to resume the NHL season Aug. 1, Green, Polak and three other players joined Calgary defenceman Travis Hamonic in choosing not to participate in the expanded 24-team playoffs. “Due to the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 and after much consideration, I’ve decided for deeply personal family health reasons not to participate in the return to play,” Green said in a statement. After a trade from Detroit, the defenceman played two games for Edmonton before injuring his right knee. Boston’s Steven Kampfer, Montreal’s Karl Alzner and Vancouver’s Sven Baertschi also decided to opt out. Kampfer, who played 10 games with the Bruins this season, said his wife and son have a congenital defect that could cause complications with the virus and called it “one of the hardest decisions” he has had to make. Polak is a pending free agent who last month agreed to a deal in his native Czech Republic next season and told reporters there he wasn’t planning on returning to the NHL if play resumed. Baertschi, who spent most of this season in the minors, is under contract through 2020-21. “Sven informed us late yesterday that he has chosen to opt out of the NHL return to play program,” Canucks general manager Jim Benning said. “It was a difficult decision but ultimately one we respect and understand.” Hamonic became the first player to publicly choose not to play in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Hamonic’s daughter was hospitalized last year with respiratory issues, and he and his wife also have a baby boy. Their health concerns, not the soon-to-be 30-year-old’s impending free agency, led him to opt out. “I wish I could lace up my skates and be out there battling, blocking a shot and helping my team win, but my family has and always will come first,” Hamonic said. “Being my little kids’ dad every day is the most important job I have. I love this game and my team. This is a decision that is extremely hard for me to make.” The Lightning already got a pandemic scare when three players and additional staff tested positive for the novel coronavirus last month. The positive test results forced the team to close its facilities for a brief period of time. The Minnesota Wild, who face the Canucks in the qualifying round, ruled out defenceman Greg Pateryn indefinitely with an upper-body injury. NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said Saturday the league will be taking over injury and illness disclosure from teams as a way of protecting player privacy. “Medical privacy is important in this process,” Daly said. “Having said that, we understand as a league we have an obligation of some transparency with respect to the COVID virus in particular, so at least for now we’re going to maintain a policy where the league is announcing on basically league numbers and clubs are really prohibited from giving any information with respect to COVID test results, and, for purposes of making the system work, any injury information going forward.”"

Messy, gassy, and unapologetically, I take up space, much like a full-grown Saint Bernard, in my parents’ parallel universe. Sadly, the pandemic has reduced this broke-ass millennial into a drooling state of oversized adolescence. After living in a luxury granite box with six roommates (two of them were front-line workers), and surviving a turtle-slow recovery from COVID-19 symptoms, I found myself moving residences again in May 2020.  At 11 a.m., ravenous, I amble into my parents’ basement for breakfast. I count seven family-sized bags of yam tortilla chips, thirty-two cans of cream of mushroom soup, two forty-pound bags of jasmine rice, and seven bottles of blue dishwashing liquid. Name it, and we most likely have it, buried under the bulk bird seed on Shelf 8. “Told you to always stock up for emergencies,” my mother announces. I roll my eyes, but I help her set a trap for our ongoing rodent problem. Diaspora, like heart-exploding grief, OCD, and excessive ambition, has both wrecked and strengthened our family. My Chinese family belongs to a particular sect of professional hoarders, and this current pandemic has only validated their lifestyle. Like many once impoverished immigrants, we have been preparing — AKA paranoid — for multiple global disasters long before COVID-19 happened. I once used to scoff at this gratuitous habit of radical saving and stockpiling on repeat, but it makes sense to me now.  For as long as I can remember, my parents have resisted the preternatural tug of the homeland. It wasn’t until March 2019 that the siren call, like severe tinnitus, became impossible to ignore. Off to Hong Kong we embarked, a place of once vicious famine and long-squashed dreams. It would be my first time in Asia, and I couldn’t bear to turn down a complimentary trip. Upon leaving Hong Kong International Airport, as if by sorcery, the humidity freshened my sandpaper skin, and volumized my iron-flat Vancouverite hair. It was as if the city was welcoming it’s long lost, weirdo daughter with a makeover. Our week was a flurry of show and tell and, one day, we went to my parents’ respective villages. We took the MTR from Mong Kok, bussed on public transit, rode a train, which was followed by multiple taxi rides to the slums. It took 4.5 hours to get there. Finally, my mother, almost shyly, showed us her childhood home-school, built on top of a creepy open-hole graveyard, and talked about how she would play with the jutting bones of corpses as a child. The grotesque trees, arthritic-looking and uncared for, made me so sad I felt everything turn to decay inside me. “No wonder you’re so messed up,” I blurted, and instantly regretted it. “You’re the one who’s messed up,” she retorted in Cantonese. “Can’t do math, complains all the time about stomach aches-” “No,” I said, shivering despite the heat. “I mean, this is why you are so scared of ghosts and starving to death.” “Um, yeah,” she said, smacking me on the back of my head. I groaned. But then she sighed, eyebrows furrowing together. She glanced around, no longer a simple tourist, as if really looking for the first time, seemingly sorrowful at the dilapidated graves scattered around us. Did she regret coming back? However she felt, for the first time I understood her fear of scarcity, this ancient inherited trauma. After all, I felt diaspora was best suited for gamblers, entrepreneurs, great white sharks, and hopeless optimists. For the rest of us, mediocres and sentimentalists, when you involuntarily hop country and home, you accumulate a Tantalus gluttony, and you fill the physical void with pragmatic things that can be eaten, bartered or saved. POC, especially impoverished ones like my mother, understand that shit inevitably happens, and it’s best to be prepared. Nice housing is only provisional. “We’re never coming back,” my mother finally pronounced, and we followed her, like a congregation of fruit flies — far away from her private destitution to our four-star hotel, our temporary home in Asia. As for me, I didn’t mind Hong Kong at all. In fact, it felt like I had almost never left Vancouver. Everyone looked exactly like me, neither worse nor better. For the remaining trip, we ate and shopped like the middle-class we aspired to be, as if we were badass rice-eaters on vacation instead of scared immigrants on their homecoming. I arrived back in Canada with fifteen cheap polyester dresses, all beaded, lacy and ridiculous, and I decided I was ready for any literary event, Comic-Con or Halloween. It only fazed me a little that being a size 2 in North America meant that I was XXXL in Asia. In my eccentric, complicated glory, I realized that I’d become capitalism’s bitch and my mother’s daughter: more is better and surplus is safer.  In my parents’ world, though, it often feels like I’m tumbling backwards when my peers are levelling up with adulting in the guise of matrimony, mortgages, babies, promotions. I tell myself when the pandemic is over, surely I’ll move into the RV parked on the driveway or perhaps a distant relation (that I don’t know of) will die, leaving me money and allowing me to purchase a sea vessel. Wouldn’t it be super-fun to live on a houseboat? I think excitedly. You could throw your roommates, friends, lovers, and family members overboard whenever they were too loud or obnoxious. COVID-19 may be my generation’s diaspora, but it’s also my family’s latest, haunting trauma. At my parents’ dwelling, I have a recurring high-stress nightmare where I am trying to frantic-pack a wheelie suitcase because the building is supposed to explode in two minutes. Panicked, I hurl clothing into a never ending black hole of fabric. Fed up, I zip up the case, but it expands like an inflatable balloon. Screeching, I beseech the suitcase to rescale to a normal size. Action-heroine I am not, and the suitcase knows this. Eventually, it grows so unwieldy and wide that it doesn’t fit through the door frame, but I’m relentless and determined enough to save all my belongings, even though I know I’m doomed. Then, as the building ignites, special effects inferno-BOOM!, homegirl wakes up-all lock-jawed, sweat-stinky, and terrified. It is a shame to lose all my things! I growl, and regretful I am in this waking life, and so I wonder where I had purchased the defective suitcase. Who do I blame, really, but myself? Anything, at any moment in flight, might turn out to be unbearable, might transform into a sign of absurdity that one might never escape."

Sgt. Jason Carrier and Const. Keon Woronuk have been temporarily demoted after a disciplinary hearing found each of them guilty of multiple counts of misconduct.  The 2017 incident — reported on by Chat News Today on Monday — apparently stemmed from the officers’ opposition to the minister’s bid to protect more local land. The disciplinary decision said the two men were upset because Shannon Phillips, who was then the environment minister, was pushing to turn swaths of the nearby Castle Wilderness area into a park that would not allow ATV use. “Sgt. Carrier did not agree with the plan Minister Phillips was outlining as he, and others he knew, enjoyed outdoor activities in the Castle area and opposed potential restrictions,” according to the agreed statement of facts. According to the statement, Carrier recognized Phillips when she arrived at the Chef Stella Diner on the morning of April 14, 2017. He was already there with two other on-duty and uniformed officers, both junior in rank, when Phillips sat down at the next table. He said he overheard Phillips discussing her plans for the Castle Wilderness area, though, speaking to media Monday, the MLA disputed this, and said she was actually discussing the reintroduction of bison to Banff National Park.  Carrier took a photo of the meeting and texted it to Woronuk, and “invited him to attend.” The agreed statement of facts notes that the two were friends and both liked to camp and fish in the Castle, a range of wilderness on the eastern slopes of the Rockies. When he arrived, Woronuk also took a photo of the group, the report said. While he was paying, Carrier took a selfie of himself with the minister in the background. Outside the diner, the report quotes Woronuk as having said he “would hate to see Phillips drive away from the restaurant and there was a reason to stop her.” Carrier replied that she should receive the same treatment as anyone else “such as a soccer mom speeding through a playground,” according to the report, and that politicians shouldn’t get special treatment. With that, both officers went to their vehicles. Carrier drove to a parkade to do reports and monitor activity because it was “known for prostitution-related activities,” according to the agreed-upon facts. From inside his vehicle, he noticed Phillips leave the diner and walk away before noon. Woronuk, meanwhile, had set up to surveil the diner, and watched one of the diners — the report doesn’t specify who — leave, then followed the vehicle for five blocks before losing it at a red light. He drove a few more blocks but couldn’t find the vehicle again.  Woronuk also ran the licence plate through the central police database despite being motivated by “personal and political views,” as opposed to concerns for public safety, the decision said.  Carrier has maintained that he was not involved in the official surveillance or traffic enforcement of Phillips or the other diners, the decision says. Phillips said she believes she was tailed by a police officer that day. Phillips, who’d previously reported the photos to police, called the whole incident “very disturbing.” “If officers in this town are going to place someone under surveillance, because they don't agree with them, what does that mean for overall community safety?” On Twitter on Monday evening, Alberta Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer said he’d learned of the events that night, and shared in the “outrage” being expressed. “To say it is completely unacceptable that members of the police would conduct unauthorized surveillance of any Albertan — in particular an elected official — is an understatement,” he posted. He said that the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team, the province’s police watchdog, had been ordered to conduct a review to determine if there are grounds for a criminal investigation. He added that he’d instructed his department to arrange for an out-of-province prosecutor should ASIRT require legal advice. The events came to light after Phillips filed a complaint in 2017 under the Police Act after learning that photos of her at the diner had been posted to Facebook. This sparked an investigation by the Calgary Police Service. According to a notice posted to the Lethbridge police website, Woronuk admitted five counts of misconduct, including using his position to his personal advantage and discrediting the reputation of the police service. He is being demoted two grades to a Constable level 1 for two years. Carrier was found guilty of two counts, including neglecting his duties as a police officer, and is being demoted one grade to Senior Constable, Level 2, for one year. "

Obviously those emotions are still fresh,” team captain Connor McDavid told reporters on a Zoom call after practice at Rogers Place. “It makes it even more real now that we’re all together and he’s not able to join us. “He’s obviously going to be in our thoughts and in our hearts as we go forward.” Cave, from Battleford, Sask., died April 11 in a Toronto hospital while in a medically induced coma following surgery to remove a colloid cyst that was causing pressure on his brain. He played 67 career NHL games for the Boston Bruins and the Edmonton Oilers. The centre was called up for 11 games by the Oilers last season. When the Oilers skated out before for their first official return to play practice, the scoreboard above centre ice displayed a picture of Cave in his orange Oiler uniform high-fiving fans beside the message “We Skate for Colby.” Head coach Dave Tippett said the team held a meeting about Cave’s death prior to practice. “Colby was an unbelievable young man, great teammate. Obviously a friend to everybody in our locker room,” said Tippett. “He would be with us today if he hadn’t passed. He planned to be with our group (for the upcoming Stanley Cup tournament). “He’s with us in spirit.” The COVID-19 virus kept Cave’s wife Emily from his bedside and continues to cast a long shadow over the NHL as it prepares to finish the season with 24 teams playing in isolation in two hub cities: Edmonton and Toronto. Players are allowed to opt out without sanction. Oiler defenceman Mike Green has already announced he will sit out, citing personal family health reasons. Asked about it, Tippett said, “(The decision) didn’t catch me off guard. “(Green) was really struggling with the decision, but he decided that for personal reasons with his family it was the best situation for him, and you have to respect that. “This is unprecedented times. You’ve got to allow for flexibility.” The first day of camp saw Ryan Nugent-Hopkins playing on a wing with Connor McDavid and Zack Kassian. The Oilers open the best-of-five qualifying round Aug. 1 vs. the Chicago Blackhawks. Their fortunes will rise or fall with McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, who was crowned the regular season scoring champ after the season was suspended March 12, around the 70-game mark. Nugent-Hopkins said while on hiatus he used some weights from his brother, did some roller blading and then began skating once the smaller rinks opened up in British Columbia. The tournament will be a whirlwind, sometimes with three games a day in each of the hub cities with no fans cheering them on. Nugent-Hopkins said there won’t be any home ice advantage. “We know it’s going to be intense,” he said. “There’s going to be a lot of energy. Without the fans we’ll have to find ways to create our own energy.” Kassian said the practices are critical because there is very little runway before the games resume. “There’s no team that’s ahead of any other team in this thing. Whoever comes in and whoever competes the hardest, whoever gets off on the right foot is going to have the most success, especially in these best-of-five series,” he said."

Can anyone imagine a team being called the Washington Blackskins? Or the Whiteskins? Of course not. But at least the team has finally decided to sideline the name and get a new one. That brings us to the Edmonton Eskimos, one of Canada’s legendary football teams. Does its name also reek of racist colonialism? Or is it just a tongue-in-cheek alliterative reminder of Edmonton’s long, dark winters? As racial issues burst forth in the U.S. and here in Canada too, as statues of Christopher Columbus come tumbling down, and cities such as Columbus, Ohio consider changing their names, it’s becoming obvious that names we took for granted are more than just names — they have history and meaning too.  And for some people those names are also a reminder, perhaps even a glorification, of the way they were mistreated by colonial authorities, missionaries, and European settlers.  Take the word Eskimo, for example. According to the Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, although Eskimo was a commonly used word it is now considered unacceptable because it was imposed on Indigenous people by colonial authorities.  For Norma Dunning, an Inuk professor at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, the team name is definitely racist and should be changed because it is an insult to the smallest group of Indigenous people in Canada — the Inuit.  “I’m often told that it’s only football and the name is harmless. Harmless to whom? Harmless to the future generations of Inuit children who will grow up hearing that word — that one word, “Eskimos” — and be conditioned into believing that it’s OK?” she wrote recently. One of the team’s sponsors — Belair Direct, a home and car insurance company — has also urged the team to change its name.  That seemed to get the attention of team executives, who hastily announced they would conduct another review of the name issue. They have already canvassed Inuit people to see what they thought of the name and concluded there was no consensus on whether it should be changed. That alone indicates that a lot of the Inuk surveyed don’t like the name. Perhaps a majority since consensus implies total agreement. In any event the name remained. Whether another review will come up with a different response from the team remains to be seen.  Speaking of colonial authorities, it’s interesting to look around and see how many Canadian towns and cities are named in true colonial style after British royalty — Victoria, Prince Rupert, Prince George, Prince Albert. There’s even a province — Prince Edward Island.  And perhaps the most colonial name of all is British Columbia.  The Columbia part is named after our friend Christopher Columbus and once designated the entire northwest coastal territories. But when the British took over the northern part of Columbia it was renamed British Columbia.  Alberta is not far behind. It was named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta, Queen Victoria’s fourth daughter and wife of Canada’s Governor-General. I guess we should be thankful the province wasn’t simply dubbed Albert after Queen Victoria’s consort.  Is it this yearning for colonial times that prompted some conservative types, including Alberta premier Jason Kenney, to refer to Canada Day as Dominion Day?  Names can be changed. The Queen Charlotte Islands named after the Queen consort of King George III were renamed Haida Gwaii by the people who actually live there.  And we certainly have lots of other examples of Indigenous names — Kelowna, Nanaimo, Yukon, Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Manitoba, Winnipeg, Toronto, Niagara, and Quebec — that distinguish Canada as a place with Indigenous origins.  One of my favourites is Skookumchuk, a Chinook name for three places in B.C. that means “strong tide, strong ocean current, rapids.” In this day and age would we be comfortable with a team named the Calgary Indians? Or the Toronto Half Breeds? Those words were once part of common language but they are now considered insulting.

The Penguins did not reveal which players were held out as a precautionary measure. The NHL has barred teams from revealing injury or illness information as a way to protect player privacy. The players in question were potentially exposed to an individual who had contact with a person who tested positive. The players will not be allowed to practice until they are deemed safe following further test results based on NHL protocols. All teams opened camps Monday in preparation for the NHL’s 24-team playoffs, scheduled to open in two hub cities — Toronto and Edmonton, Alberta — on Aug. 1.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada. In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district. But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he’ll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends. That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won’t be able to resist going out. “Once it becomes the ‘real playoffs’ I think more and more the momentum will grab,” he said. Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely. Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas. “You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you’re doing it in a safe manner,” said Black. The players themselves aren’t to have any contact with the general public. Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto’s associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often. An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn’t be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes. Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city’s civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday. “The City of Edmonton’s first priority is public safety and we’ll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,” Grimble said. Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when — not if — his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing. “We have to get through this together or else it’s not going to change,” said McLeod. But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn’t have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer. “It’s daylight ‘til 11 o’clock. You don’t want to spend half your day watching hockey,” Merhej explained. “I’d rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.”"

The omission is revealed in a series of emails between the two governments obtained by The Canadian Press. “We have been made aware ... that the Alberta Energy Regulator has indefinitely suspended several environmental monitoring requirements for major oilsands producers,” wrote Erin Kelly, the N.W.T.’s deputy environment minister to her Alberta counterpart. “Do you have any information that can be shared about this?” The May 15 email was written more than a week after Alberta’s regulator suspended a wide array of monitoring over what it said were public-health concerns raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. Kelly said her government learned about the move from news reports. Ten days later, Kelly had not received a response. “This is concerning to many N.W.T. residents, who still maintain subsistence lifestyles,” she wrote May 25. “With COVID-19 we have even more residents relying on food harvested from the land and it is almost certain that concerns related to reduced monitoring upstream will be brought up during (the upcoming legislative) session.” Monitoring is expected to resume Wednesday. The N.W.T. is downstream from the oilsands and in 2015 signed an agreement with Alberta that spelled out clear responsibilities on information-sharing, notification and consultation for cross-boundary waters. In her second email, Kelly points to that deal. “The (territory) has not been informed of or discussed new changes to monitoring as per (the agreement). I have yet to receive a response to my last email.” An Alberta Environment and Parks email shows Kelly’s second note provoked an “urgent” request within the department for a response to her concerns. In answer to a request for an explanation for the lack of consultation, Alberta’s United Conservative government provided a one-sentence email. “There have been ongoing discussions and information-sharing with the N.W.T. on the status of ambient water quality monitoring at sites referenced in the Alberta-N.W.T. Bilateral Agreement throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in March,” wrote Alberta Environment spokesman John Muir. Joslyn Oosenbrug, spokeswoman for the N.W.T. Environment Department, said several meetings were held in June to address the territory’s concerns. “Alberta has committed to sharing information and discussing any changes to monitoring,” she wrote in an email. “Communication is ongoing, and includes emails and letters exchanged at the deputy minister and ministerial level.” However, the territory wants a stronger voice in managing water flowing into its land. It wants a seat on several committees that determine how waters will be monitored “to ensure downstream interests are represented,” Oosenbrug wrote. Marlin Schmidt, environment critic for Alberta’s Opposition New Democrats, said the snub showed a “lack of respect.” “It’s really disappointing to me to see the government of Alberta is taking its relationship with other Canadians so lightly right now,” he said. “When our government is complaining about the poor treatment that we’re allegedly getting from other Canadians, we should be treating (them) with the respect with which we expect to be treated.” The N.W.T. isn’t the only interested group that wasn’t consulted about the suspensions. First Nations in the oilsands area, environmental groups, Alberta’s chief scientist and the scientific consultants who perform monitoring work all say they were left out of the decision. The government has said the move was made in response to concerns from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers about operators not being able to meet certain monitoring requirements while complying with COVID-19 orders. Alberta has yet to release work plans or budget for this year’s field season of a joint federal-provincial program responsible for environmental monitoring outside various oilsands leases. Industry, which funds the efforts, has been lobbying heavily for a less extensive and cheaper plan."

The siblings have been separated for more than 20 years. Gele and Abdille, along with their parents, moved to the Daadab refugee complex in Kenya after fleeing their war-torn homeland, Somalia, in 1991. Gele eventually came to Halifax in 1997, but her family stayed behind. While she’s thought about her family members often throughout her time in Nova Scotia, the past few months have been especially difficult and their catch-up WhatsApp calls have become less and less lighthearted, according to Gele. Abdille’s asthma has become more threatening over the last two years, and with COVID-19 preventing puffers and medication from flowing to the Daadab refugee complex, Gele said she worries that her brother, too, will fall victim to the chronic disease. Asthma runs in their family and it claimed the lives of their aunt and grandfather. “Every morning I talk to them to see how he’s doing. Some days he’s OK, some days he’s getting worse, sometimes it’s really scary,” said Gele. “The situation is very, very hard now. Every night, my brother thinks (whether) he will die now or not. When he’s home and he’s sitting, really he cannot even breathe.” Abdille’s 14-year-old daughter Nasteeh, who similarly suffers from asthma, has also been on Gele’s mind lately. Gele said the father and daughter have hardly stepped foot outside in the last four months during the COVID-19 pandemic, given their immuno compromised state. United We Win Halifax, a private sponsorship group that met Gele through her translation and settlement support services for newcomers in Nova Scotia, has launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to sponsor and bring Abdille, his wife and seven of their children who are under 18, to Halifax. “We were really struck partly by how much Nasra was doing in the community, but also trying to support her brother (in Kenya), sending money to him to buy food and medication,” said Dave Aalders, a member of United We Win Halifax. Aalders said Gele told him about the asthma attacks her brother would have where he “didn’t know (if) he was going to live” and the limited health care and access to medication at the refugee complex. That prompted the group to lend a hand. “We want to be able to help,” he said. “And also the fact that (Abdille) has been (at the refugee camp) since the early ‘90s and the world sort of tends to forget about some refugees, that bothered us as well, that there are folks that have been there for that long and haven’t had a chance to get out.” The group’s GoFundMe fundraising goal is $10,000, but that will only cover a portion of the $30,000 that is required to bring a refugee family the size of the Abdille family to Canada and support them for one year, according to Aalders. They have also set up accounts with some bottle depots in Halifax, allowing community members to exchange their bottles and have the money from that exchange go directly toward an account in the United We Win Halifax’s name to help sponsor the Abdille family. “The sooner we can get the money raised, the sooner we can (complete) the application and get things rolling,” said Aalders, adding they want to sponsor other refugees, seeing how “the need is so great.” Aalders acknowledged that the federal government has put its refugee resettlement programs on hold during the pandemic, but said he hopes they will be able to bring the Abdille family to Canada soon as possible. “They’ll be able to (live) in a healthier environment and not have to worry about (Abdille) dying from not being able to breathe or (Nasteeh),” he said. ‘I would be really happy to see my family’ With the poor housing conditions, dust and extreme heat at the Daadab refugee complex, Gele said she’s concerned the respiratory conditions afflicting her brother and niece will only worsen, making them more susceptible to COVID-19. Gele had asthma herself, but recovered from the disease a year after arriving in Halifax. Living here, she said she’s grateful to have access to an emergency room or a puffer if ever she experiences an asthma attack, but recognizes her family is not so lucky. Aalders said this is concerning, considering how the virus “could spread like wildfire” in a typically overcrowded refugee camp. Ultimately, Gele said she wants her family to be able to live in “good health,” as she hopes for all people, and reunite with them in Halifax. “For 25 years, I haven’t seen my parents or my brother or my family. I have seven children and my children have never seen their uncle or my parents, so I would be really happy to see my family,” she said. “I want to say thank you so much to anyone supporting my family.” Aalders said people can contact United We Win Halifax at unitedwewinhfx@gmail.com for more information about sponsoring the Abdille family or to pitch in for the bottle exchange initiative."

On Wednesday, they announced through a post on Twitter that staff would be handing out single-use surgical masks at Mumford Terminal Thursday morning. Some passengers taking the bus at the terminal Thursday afternoon said the initiative is welcome, but it’s not enough. Shawn Jackson has always taken the bus and she continued to do so through the COVID-19 pandemic. She said she felt safe at the beginning, but as people are becoming more complacent, she’s now feeling the opposite. She said at least half of the passengers on the bus she takes don’t wear masks. “I think it should be mandatory that you wear a mask,” said Jackson. Jackson hadn’t heard that Halifax Transit was handing out free masks. But she said masks would protect all passengers, especially that people can now stand up on the bus. “They all stand up in one spot, right by the middle door. There’s no social distancing in that spot,” she said. In early April, Halifax Transit had prohibited standing on its buses, but they now allow five passengers to stand. “If you’re going to charge a fare and you’re going to re-introduce paying again, everyone has to be protected when they get on there,” she said.  Brenda Dorton also thinks mandatory masks would ensure everyone’s safety. “It’s hard for transit to control what people will do because they’ve been given the option of wearing a mask or not wearing a mask,” she said. Thursday was Dorton’s first time on a bus since Nova Scotia went into a state of emergency. She said she was a bit nervous and is taking precautions to stay safe. She was wearing a mask and carried hand sanitizer to use after getting off the bus.  Robin Pyke has also been avoiding transit for as long as she could. But apartment hunting left her with no choice but to take the bus. Like Jackson, Pyke wasn’t aware that Halifax Transit was handing out masks. But said she always keeps one in her bag to wear at the Halifax Shopping Centre where she works, and now on the bus. “In an indoor situation and even on buses I think there’s definitely logic behind wearing them to help protect other people,” she said. “I think it’s hard to enforce because everybody has different feelings about it.” For a new immigrant in Canada, Twitter may not be the best place to announce mask giveaways.  Nemat Abdul Aleem has only been in Nova Scotia for a month. She doesn’t have any social media accounts, and did not know about the free masks. Abdul Aleem said she wore a mask everywhere when she first came to the province, but as the number of COVID-19 cases dropped, she stopped. Still, she would wear one if it became mandatory. Other passengers said they felt the same. “I don’t feel comfortable wearing one, but if I really have to, for sure I’ll have one,” said Arnault Binja.  Robert Phillips would also wear one if it became mandatory. But he said enforcing masks means they should become more accessible. “There should be some kind of dispensary where you walk through the door and pull one out,” he said. Phillips hadn’t been outside much since the pandemic. But he felt safe on his few transit trips. “People tend to keep their distance. (They would) sit there and mind their business,” he said. On Thursday afternoon, the Mumford Terminal didn’t have more than two dozen people at any time. Route 1 heading to Spring Garden Road in the early afternoon had at most eight passengers, half of whom wore a mask. Phillips said he’s not sure if he would continue to take the bus if it gets crowded. “It might be a little risky. But I think the huge majority of people out and about in the open don’t have COVID anyway to begin with.” In Thursday’s COVID-19 briefing, Dr. Robert Strang said he will continue to strongly recommend wearing masks in spaces where it’s difficult to maintain six feet between people. These spaces include stores, elevators, crowded outdoor spaces and public transit. “We need to make it a habit to always have a mask with us,” he said. People should also continue to follow other public health recommendations, such as handwashing, cleaning high-touch surfaces, and staying at home when feeling unwell."
33,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/news/canada/2020/07/09/canadian-police-chiefs-recommend-decriminalizing-personal-possession-of-illicit-drugs.html,"As the deadly opioid crisis rages, Canada’s police chiefs say they’re ready for a new approach","['Steve McKinleyHalifax Bureau', 'Wanyee LiVancouver Bureau']","Thu., July 9, 2020","VANCOUVER—Everytime Melissa Steinhauer sees a police officer, she worries they might start asking questions. In her neighbourhood, the Downtown Eastside, drug use is prevalent and so is conflict between users and police. Steinhauer, who uses heroin and cocaine, said she’s thought about being arrested for possession “many times, but it hasn’t happened, which I’m thankful for.” The fear she describes is what experts say has proven deadly time and time again, pushing drug users further underground and away from harm-reduction services. Years deep in an opioid crisis that’s raged across the country and even become deadlier, in some quarters, during the pandemic, Canada’s police chiefs say it’s time to try a different approach. They’re publicly calling for the decriminalization of the personal possession of illicit drugs and for all police agencies in the country to recognize substance abuse and addiction as a public health issue, rather than a criminal one. In a new statement, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police proposed diverting people dealing with substance abuse or addiction issues away from the criminal system and toward social services and health care. The association stipulated such change would need to be synchronized nationally. “Canada continues to grapple with the fentanyl crisis and a poisoned drug supply that has devastated our communities and taken thousands of lives,” said Chief Const. Adam Palmer, president of the CACP in the release. “We recommend that enforcement for possession give way to an integrated health-focused approach that requires partnerships between police, health care and all levels of government.” The report also endorsed access to users of a safe supply of pharmaceutical-grade opioids to combat the uncertain composition of illegal street drugs, which is the cause of many opioid overdoses. It further made a recommendation in favour of supervised consumption sites — where people could use drugs in a clean, safe environment, under the supervision of health professionals trained in emergency intervention. Under the CACP recommendations, police would continue to target drug traffickers, producers and importers. Steinhauer, who is a secretary at the Western Aboriginal Harm Reduction Society, said decriminalizing personal possession of illicit drugs would be a step in the right direction. Police though, she said, need to recognize the damage they do when officers seize drugs from dealers as well. When her regular dealer loses his dope to officers, Steinhauer is sometimes left scrambling and forced to buy drugs from someone she doesn’t know. Sometimes that means the drugs are contaminated. “Then I don’t know what’s in it,” she said. “Sometimes when you’re really sick, you don’t think ‘Oh, I’m going to get it tested.’ You just want to feel better. You want to get your medicine and feel better.” There have been 15,393 apparent opioid-related deaths in Canada between January 2016 and December 2019, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. In May, more than five people in B.C. died every day from illicit drug overdose, the highest number yet recorded in the province, according to the BC Coroners Service. The recommendations from the CACP were spawned by a Special Purpose Committee report titled: Decriminalization for Simple Possession of Illicit Drugs: Exploring Impacts on Public Safety & Policing. Waterloo police Chief Brian Larkin, who co-chairs the CACP’s Special Purpose Committee, said the opioid crisis — which began on the West Coast around 2014 and swept across the country over the next two years — made it clear that some changes were due. “When you look at policing, we’re responsible for advancing public safety in Canada,” said Larkin. “And we have a consensus amongst police leaders, including federally, that it’s time to have a dialogue. What’s been happening in the past clearly is not working for us.” He said in preparing the report, they examined the approaches of countries such as Portugal, Sweden and Norway, where drug possession is still illegal, but criminal sanction, it’s been decided, is not the solution. Drug policy advocates applauded the Canadian police chiefs’ call for decriminalization, but some were wary of the programs that might replace current practices.  “The way that CAPC has framed it, suggests they may be in favour of implementing some kind of administrative regime. So if somebody is found to be in possession, they won’t get criminal charges, but they may get a fine, or they may be forced into treatment,” said Caitlin Shane, a staff lawyer at Pivot Legal Society.  “When people fear arrest, or detention, or any kind of penalty, they’re going to be forced into more precarious scenarios, when using drugs.” The organization has been calling on authorities to recognize the “harms of criminalization” for decades, said Shane. “What we want to see is a situation where no one is penalized, whether criminally or administratively, for possessing small amounts of drugs for personal use.” In the CACP report, the committee outlines the toll of the opioid crisis and why it believes decriminalization of possession alone won’t work. “While decriminalization can reduce some harms for people who use drugs, they are still dependent on an illegal market where the contents and strength of drugs are unknown. The unregulated drug supply in Canada has become toxic leading to overdoses and death.” The recommendations put forth by CACP would require some changes to the Controlled and Substances Act, said Larkin. That puts the onus going forward on the federal government. “At the end of the day, we can suggest, we can recommend, but it’s up to the federal government to introduce legislation,” he said. “But we think that we will have a voice — this isn’t some utopian pie-in-the-sky thing that we’re floating out there. We feel very confident in our discussions with government.” The CACP made it clear that its recommendations for dealing with the opioid crisis were independent of the ongoing conversation on scaling back police funding in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minnesota on May 25. “A decriminalization or diversion model will not provide any opportunity for police agencies to reduce their operating budgets or staffing,” said the report, which was dated July 2020. “Some have suggested that decriminalization would free up police officer time and budgets could be reallocated to other priorities; however, police agencies must continue to resource drug enforcement units dedicated to disrupting the illicit drug markets.”"

Cpl. Jennifer Clarke said the RCMP were called to assist at the Fort Lawrence crossing near the border with New Brunswick just before 8 p.m. Wednesday. She said a man from East Amherst has been charged with assaulting a peace officer and breach of conditions. Jason MacLean, president of the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union, said the incident happened during a routine vehicle inspection, and it’s left the officer shaken. MacLean said the driver objected to the inspection and tried to choke the male officer, who used his radio to call for help from some nearby conservation officers. Those officers helped detain the alleged assailant before the police arrived, he said in an interview Thursday. The officer, MacLean said, “is very lucky that there were conservation officers nearby.” He said vehicle compliance officers have raised concerns about safety in the past because they work alone and are equipped only with radios. During a COVID-19 news conference Thursday, Nova Scotia’s premier said the incident is concerning and thanked public servants for their efforts as the province reopens its borders to Atlantic Canada. But when asked what his government would do to improve safety for peace officers, McNeil accused the union of distracting from wider efforts to recover from the pandemic. “To me, the union has looked at every opportunity to complain and looked to divide,” the premier said. “I will not allow some people to try to divide our province as we continue to work our way through dealing with COVID and reopen our economy.” McNeil said law enforcement agencies will be placed at the border if needed, but said some groups are bringing up past issues while the province tries to move forward. The premier said the province reported no new cases of COVID-19 and one additional recovery from the illness. MacLean said the premier’s outburst reflects a bad attitude towards unions and their safety demands. He noted that his union had not raised the pandemic when discussing Wednesday’s incident, and said the inspection happening at the time was not related to the pandemic or to border controls. “It’s unfortunate that (McNeil) gets that way because we’re speaking out on bona fide issues that are ones of safety,” MacLean said. “We’re going to continue to advocate.” He said the union’s duty is to stand up for members at a time when safety at work is paramount, and that it’s unfortunate the premier interprets safety concerns as sources of division. “Lost in all of this are the heroes that (McNeil) says are out there doing all the work, and I’ll tell you, it’s tough times,” MacLean said."

We joke now that he put the “sand” in sandwich, but it was quite uncomfortable at the time — and not just from a digestion point of view. Luke was five, and his big brother was seven. Hand in hand, they had taken a leap into the unknown — loaded up their backpacks with their towels, sunhats and their wholesome and ample lunches, and trundled off to the local elementary school that was doubling as a municipal day camp for a few weeks that summer. From a mother’s point of view, it was all about some structured summer fun for the kids — cut-and-paste, mixed with supervised soccer and lounging in the playground — while I worked. From the kids’ point of view, it was an unfamiliar world of vague rules and new faces. According to the not-always-reliable reporting from his brother, when lunchtime came, Luke sat down in the sandbox, open his lunchbox and dumped out everything into the sand. And then ate it anyway. Even though he even consumed all his carrots as instructed at home before he left that morning, I was mortified at the lack of close supervision and the sudden need for my youngster to be self-sufficient. Of course, he survived and we both learned something. He needed to take on new responsibility (keeping his lunch out of the dirt). I needed to let go, a little bit. It was the start of a decade-long dance of daring that has pushed both of us to embrace growing up. As day camp turned into overnight camp and eventually specialized baseball camp, every summer experience has heightened that independence — despite the moments of discomfort. Summer camp is childcare with an edge. The kids are tossed into a mixer with the promise of fun and the challenge of more freedom. The parents have time and space to work, but with the nagging challenge of giving their precious charges more scope for autonomy. The experience changes all of us, usually for the better but perhaps with a nervous stomach-ache along the way. For underprivileged children, the Star’s Fresh Air Fund has been an importance source of that experience for the past 120 years. And while this year of pandemic restraints has its particular challenges for summer camp, the fund is campaigning anyway in the hopes of raising $650,000. So far we’ve raised more than $400,000 so far. If COVID-19 gets in the way, we’ll use the money next year and make up for lost time. As an economics writer keeping tabs on the financial fallout of the pandemic, I am continuously reminded that the value of accessible childcare has never been more tangible — camp during the summer and school in September. It’s so central to the way the economy functions. With the kids at home all the time, workers, especially mothers by default, have a difficult time putting in a full day’s work-from-home, and certainly can’t return to the office. Single moms are in a particularly bad bind. Normally staid economists have whooped with joy or crumpled with dismay about the state of their own lives the day they received the notice from their chosen summer camps about their state of re-opening this month. But child advocates go far beyond the economic case for camps, daycares and schooling. As stores and commerce resume, but camps and schools reel with new rules and constraints, child experts remind us frequently that education is an entrenched right — for a good reason. Children are especially vulnerable to being sideswiped by the pandemic restrictions, and yet the effort to resolve the care situation is stilted at best. Just a few months ago, my son had planned his whole summer around the return to baseball camp — where he would strengthen his swing, stay up until the wee hours in his bunk chatting about the game, and be drawn into the worldly experience of the older kids on the roster, despite his mother’s qualms. Actually, I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t just be chatting chastely about the game. But let’s just go with that, for the sake of my stomach. It’s still our dream for next year. Please give generously.

We joke now that he put the “sand” in sandwich, but it was quite uncomfortable at the time — and not just from a digestion point of view. Luke was five, and his big brother was seven. Side by side, they had taken a leap into the unknown — loaded up their backpacks with their towels, sun hats and their wholesome and ample lunches, and trundled off to the local elementary school that was doubling as a municipal day camp for a few weeks that summer. From a mother’s point of view, it was all about some structured summer fun for the kids — glue-and-scissors arts and crafts, mixed with supervised soccer and lounging in the playground — while I worked. From the kids’ point of view, it was an unfamiliar world of vague rules and new faces. According to the not-always-reliable reporting from his brother, when lunchtime came, Luke sat down in the sandbox, open his lunchbox and dumped out everything into the sand. And then ate it anyway. Even though he even consumed all his carrots as instructed at home before he left that morning, I was mortified at the lack of close supervision and the sudden need for my youngster to be self-sufficient. Of course, he survived and we both learned something. He needed to take on new responsibility (keeping his lunch out of the dirt). I needed to let go, a little bit. It was the start of a decade-long dance of daring that has pushed both of us to embrace his growing up. As day camp turned into overnight camp and eventually specialized baseball camp, every summer experience has heightened that independence — despite the moments of discomfort. Summer camp is child care with an edge. The kids are tossed into a mixer with the promise of fun and the challenge of more freedom. Parents have time and space to work, but with the nagging challenge of giving their precious charges more scope for autonomy. The experience changes all of us, usually for the better but perhaps with a nervous stomach ache along the way. For underprivileged children, the Star’s Fresh Air Fund has been an importance source of that experience for the past 120 years. And while this year of pandemic restraints creates particular obstacles for summer camp, the fund is campaigning anyway in the hopes of raising $650,000. So far we’ve raised more than $400,000. If COVID-19 gets in the way, we’ll use the money next year and make up for lost time. As an economics writer keeping tabs on the financial fallout of the pandemic, I am continuously reminded that the value of accessible child care has never been more tangible — camp during the summer and school in September. It’s so central to the way the economy functions. With the kids at home all the time, parents — especially mothers, by default — have a difficult time putting in a full day’s work-from-home, and certainly can’t return to the office. Single moms are in a particularly bad bind. Normally staid economists have whooped with joy or crumpled with dismay about the state of their own lives on the day they got the notice from their chosen summer camps about their state of reopening this month. But child advocates go far beyond the economic case for camps, daycares and schooling. As stores and commerce resume, but camps and schools reel with new rules and constraints, child experts remind us frequently that education is an entrenched right — for a good reason. Children are especially vulnerable to being sideswiped by the pandemic restrictions, and yet the effort to resolve the care situation is stilted at best. Just a few months ago, my son had planned his whole summer around the return to baseball camp, where he would strengthen his swing, stay up until the wee hours in his bunk chatting about the game, and be drawn into the worldly experience of the older kids on the roster, despite his mother’s qualms. Actually, I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t just be chatting chastely about the game. But let’s just go with that, for the sake of my stomach. It’s still our dream for next year. Please give generously.

37,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/politics/political-opinion/2020/07/13/justin-trudeau-skips-the-details-at-his-peril-when-he-announces-uncooked-spending-plans.html,Justin Trudeau skips the details at his peril when he announces uncooked spending plans,['Heather ScoffieldEconomics Columnist'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","When Justin Trudeau apologized Monday for his lapse in judgment about WE Charity, he delivered it with a giant bouquet of flowers — a promise to extend the 75 per cent wage subsidy for troubled companies until the end of the year. That may or may not be enough to persuade the public to forgive him for not recusing himself from the controversial file. But even if it’s not, the $50-billion commitment could go a long way toward giving companies a lifeline as they emerge from the pandemic – as long as it’s designed strategically as well as quickly. The move was foreshadowed last week in Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s fiscal update and has been weeks in negotiation, so let’s not be too cynical about the motivation behind the multi-billion-dollar announcement that Trudeau blurted out within seconds of apologizing for his involvement in the WE fiasco. But there are no details available yet for how the subsidy will work, and for that, we can be plenty cynical. Trudeau had just one sentence about it in his morning news conference, and Morneau’s office would only say — with a smiley face attached — that details were not ready yet, It’s that kind of vague policy announcement that got the prime minister in trouble with the WE file to begin with — a headline designed to fill a political need, with the fine print to come sometime “soon,” once the officials can catch up with the politics of the day. The fine print is important here, for economics and politics alike. Morneau and Trudeau have pinned their hopes for an economic restart on the wage subsidy. In theory, when provincial governments relax their COVID-19 rules, as Ontario’s Doug Ford did on Monday, the wage subsidy will kick in and help companies stay above water when they reopen just half way. Ford said some regions of the province can now open up restaurants, bars and daycares, but not necessarily at full capacity because physical distancing rules remain in place. The hope is that the federal wage subsidy will shoulder a large part of the payroll of any company that is still losing a big chunk of its revenue compared to last year, allowing firms to reopen and bring back their workers even if they’re still constrained due to pandemic rules. But how much of their payrolls will be covered by this extension? How much money does a company have to be losing in order to qualify? And what about companies that are hoping to hire back minimum-wage workers, but can’t find any because they’re collecting the more lucrative Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)? Without those answers, companies won’t know if it’s worth their time and effort to reopen on Friday as the premier hopes, says Perrin Beatty, the president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “We need to get that information as soon as possible,” Beatty said. “It’s critical for tens of thousands of businesses, particularly in some sectors” such as tourism, travel, accommodation, retail and restaurants. When it was first introduced, the wage subsidy was available to companies that could show a 30 per cent drop in revenues compared to last year. But that agreement expired at the end of June, and now, government officials and business leaders alike say the 30 per cent cut-off is too harsh — there’s no incentive for a company hovering near the threshold to make an extra dollar if it might lose its payroll support as a result. Similarly, there’s a growing understanding within government that the CERB had its place in sustaining family finances during the dark days of the lockdown, but now it needs to be wound down and replaced as employers reopen so people will be encouraged to go back to work. These are complex policy questions that officials and experts have been hammering away at with increasing urgency, but that the prime minister — in his haste to have some good news in the face of scandal — rolled out before his civil service had the required paperwork in hand. That’s partly why he ended up in hot water with WE Charity. In late April, as the opposition NDP roared about the lack of financial help for students and threatened to withhold its support for COVID-19 aid without measures, Trudeau unveiled a generous $9-billion student aid package.  Along with commitments to create more summer jobs and extend emergency benefits to students was the creation of the Canada Student Service Grant — the program now swirling at the centre of the WE controversy. It’s now clear that the plan to pay students up to $5,000 for volunteer work was not nearly ready for prime time. After winding its way through cabinet approvals, it finally saw the light of day more than two months later, only to spark an immediate controversy. While the Liberals are paying a political price for that backwards process, students continue to go without their promised support. The wage subsidy talks are well advanced, but the economic stakes of getting the design just right are high. Let’s hope Trudeau didn’t speak too soon again."

Why won't he explain how it happened?,['Susan DelacourtNational Columnist'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","Justin Trudeau made a bold bid to break up with the ethics controversy consuming his government on Monday with a new twist on an old classic: “It’s not WE. It’s me.”  There was nothing vague about the prime minister’s apology for how he and WE Charity have become tangled in an ethics storm over pandemic relief. In fact, Trudeau approached near-mathematical precision on Monday with his very personal regrets for what he had failed to do in the whole mess.  “The mistake we made was on me and I take responsibility for it,” he said. Trudeau said he was sorry he didn’t excuse himself from cabinet discussions about WE Charity, and also sorry he didn’t know more about the extent to which his family was involved with it.  What his apology didn’t cover was how this ended up in front of his cabinet in the first place, and the absence of red flags for him or his government — the crucial “what were you thinking” question that hangs over the entire story.  So while Trudeau’s words on Monday may have slightly cooled the ethics uproar that’s erupted in the midst of this pandemic, they won’t make it go away.  Significantly, his apology also offered no assurances for the future, and that’s important — this being his third brush with ethics investigations in his career as prime minister.  What has he learned about why this failed to set off ethical alarms from the outset? Monday’s me-not-WE apology didn’t quite cover that.  Trudeau’s regrets, for now, are intensely personal — maybe intentionally so. A larger, more expansive apology may not come until after the ethics commissioner’s inquiry.  It’s worth looking closely at how precise the prime minister was when he laid out on Monday where he’d gone wrong with WE and the proposal to have the charity handle nearly $1 billion in pandemic relief for students.  Trudeau did not say he was sorry about the idea, which he again said came from the public service, only that he didn’t officially bow out of the discussions about it.  “I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions, given our family’s history. I am sincerely sorry about not having done that,” Trudeau said, going on to cite all the ways the government had been working with other charities on pandemic relief. “But when it came to this organization and this program, the involvement I’d had in the past and my family has should have had me remove myself from those discussions.”  Note: Trudeau is not saying that the proposal shouldn’t have come to cabinet, only that he shouldn’t have been there. The prime minister also didn’t mention Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who has been found to have his own family conflicts with WE, including a daughter employed by the charity. It was left to Morneau to issue his own personal apology later in the day, in a separate statement, which followed the same general lines as those of his boss: not a bad idea, just unfortunately handled at cabinet.  Significantly, the finance minister hasn’t even ruled out the prospect of WE being the subject of cabinet discussions in future. “I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE,” Morneau’s statement said.  The most sincere, genuine part of Trudeau’s apology came when he was talking about how all of this has affected his mother, who has been very public — including at WE events — about her lifelong battles with mental illness.  “Obviously I knew she worked with WE,” Trudeau said. “I didn’t know the details of how much she was getting paid by various organizations but I should have and I deeply regret that. What I also deeply regret is the fact that I have brought my mother into this situation in a way that is really unfair to her.” Margaret Trudeau’s involvement with WE was definitely obvious. She and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau were together in London at a WE event in March, which is where the prime minister’s wife was believed to have contracted the COVID-19 virus that put the PM into isolation early in the pandemic.  Long before WE was picked as the favoured charity to hand out aid to students during the pandemic, in other words, it had already played a role that was a little too close to home.  Trudeau may be saving the larger, more expansive explanations for his discussions with the ethics commissioner, who will most certainly want to know more than just why the prime minister failed to absent himself from cabinet discussions about WE Charity. “It’s not WE, it’s me,” may work as a break in the heat of this controversy, but those won’t be the last words in this fraught relationship.

For all the ways in which their lives have intersected over the years, Rae and Trudeau were never particularly close. They both have strong ties to Ontario politics — Rae as a former New Democratic Party premier, Trudeau as a politician who surrounded himself with veterans of Queen’s Park from the days of Liberal power there. Nine years ago, Rae was holding the reins of the federal Liberal party on an interim basis after the disaster of the 2011 election, when what was once Canada’s “natural governing party” was knocked back to third place in the Commons. A dispirited Trudeau, having served one rookie term as a member of Parliament, was thinking of abandoning his career in politics.  Had Trudeau gone ahead with that escape plan, Rae might well have ended up turning that temporary job into the full-fledged one as leader of the Liberal party. But that’s not how the universe unfolded. Trudeau took the leader’s job and it was Rae, the former Ontario premier, who went off to post-political life: teaching, doing some legal work, some international diplomacy, even a lively podcast. Rae, who will be turning 72 next month, also got to spend time fishing, playing the piano and enjoying his grandchildren and his family cottage on Big Rideau Lake. Something changed, though, after last fall’s election, which saw Trudeau’s power cut down to size and doing all that thinking. Rae started being pulled back again into the orbit of Trudeau’s government, starting with polite, deferential requests for advice. The first subject was minority government — Trudeau’s new reality after the votes were counted on Oct. 21. Rae has a rich history with them. It was Rae’s proposed amendment to a 1979 budget — when he was an NDP MP in the Commons — that brought down Joe Clark’s Conservative minority government and paved the way for the return of Pierre Trudeau to power in 1980. In Ontario, Rae helped negotiate an accord that put David Peterson’s Liberals in power at Queen’s Park in 1985. Through his five decades in elected office, Rae has seen minorities come and go, at the federal and provincial level. “Don’t get discouraged,” Rae said this week, when asked what he said in those initial, post-election conversations with the current prime minister. “You know, this is not the end of the world and there’s a chance to rebuild … It’s a good chance to listen and figure out what happened.” Trudeau was, in fact, listening. “It was a good conversation,” Rae said. “He was very friendly and it was very direct.” Then again, right after the Christmas break, Rae’s counsel was sought once more; this time because of Ukraine International Airlines crash in Iran that killed 138 people with ties to Canada. Trudeau and his advisers wanted to know what Rae had learned when doing his major report into the 1985 Air India crash. It was in part because of Rae’s counsel, PMO officials said at the time, that Trudeau spent so much time in January with the families of the victims. A couple of weeks later, Rae headed to Winnipeg to be part of Trudeau’s winter cabinet retreat, talking to ministers about the work he had been doing as a special adviser on the Rohingya humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, also known as Burma, and Bangladesh. For a man who had left politics, Rae was spending an awful lot of time around Trudeau and his team in those first months after the election. Then came the call for lunch — a one-on-one conversation between Rae and Trudeau themselves. It was, incredibly, the first time the two men had sat down together without other people in the room or on the phone. “That was the first meeting I’d had with him alone,” Rae said. “He used to rely a lot on having other people there in the room. That’s not true anymore.” The prime minister asked Rae outright: would he be interested in a diplomatic appointment? “I said, ‘sure … what you do have in mind?’” Rae recalled. Trudeau told him that some posts might be coming up in the summer, as the decks were changed at Canadian missions abroad. Rae said he’d consider one if it was offered, and then Trudeau asked Rae if he would also be willing to pitch in with some help trying to win Canada a seat on the UN Security Council. Canada didn’t win that security council seat — despite best efforts from Rae and Trudeau and others — but Rae did get a new job. Several weeks ago, Rae was quietly offered the post of ambassador to the United Nations, and Trudeau made it official last Monday. This is a milepost — not just in the relationship between these two politicians, but also in Canada’s history and foreign policy. A global pandemic is shaking the world order, which was already being rocked by great powers such as the United States, China and Britain turning more boldly nationalist. In some ways, the pandemic has accelerated that trend toward nations putting themselves first. COVID-19 has slammed borders shut — including the one between the U.S. and Canada — and citizens around the world have had months to dwell on the perils of a highly interconnected world. Canada, in the midst of this, is facing the same choice as other nations: turn inward or double down on internationalism. Trudeau has very clearly chosen the latter, and he’s put one of Canada’s most senior political statesmen as his representative at the global crossroads of the United Nations. It is a significant shift between Trudeau in his first term and in his second term, Rae said. “The number-one priority for the government in the first term was managing the relationship with the United States and in particular, the free-trade issue,” Rae said, “but more broadly, just trying to manage the relationship with the (Donald) Trump administration.” It’s not like that relationship has become unimportant, Rae said, but Trudeau’s sights are set wider now, to the larger sets of alliances that Canada needs to build in the world. “COVID is a global event. It’s not a Canadian event or a U.S. event,” Rae said. “I think there’s a tendency to underestimate the truly global nature of this pandemic … It’s forcing everyone to realize that there are a lot of ways in which the world is changing.” The COVID-19 pandemic has often been compared to a war. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said early in the lockdown that she hoped this crisis would yield another “greatest generation,” the name given to the citizens who helped rebuild after the Second World War. Rae is a son of that generation, which also helped create the United Nations, and his father, Saul Rae, was one of Canada’s leading diplomats in this era. In the 1970s, Rae’s father served in the post that his son will take up in August, as Canada’s ambassador to the United Nations. Rae is touched, of course, by the chance to honour his father’s memory by following in his footsteps. In a way, he says, just as age has made him recognize how much he is like his father, the pandemic has made him recognize the similarities between the challenges of that century and this one. “He was very much part of the generation of diplomats who realized coming out of the Second World War they had worlds to try to build and they weren’t alone,” Rae said. “We’re rebuilding after COVID.”  This can’t just be a domestic exercise, Rae says. “I don’t think we can afford the luxury of ignoring what’s going on in the rest of the world,” he says. “There are a number of countries that are on the verge of financial collapse and that will come to the attention of everybody pretty quickly,” Rae says. In fact, when he was being asked this week how he foresaw his main job at the United Nations, Rae was saying: “that’s issue number one … that’s staring us in the face. That’s what we have to talk about in New York and wherever else we do business multilaterally.” Beyond that, the UN could well turn into an important place to negotiate the global rollout of a vaccine, he says, whenever that does arrive. That same tension, between nations looking out for themselves and a co-ordinated, global approach, will play out with the vaccine, Rae says. “The UN is one of the places where these conversations need to happen and do happen.” The Star’s Martin Regg Cohn wrote this week how Rae’s entire career had prepared him for the role he is about to take on at the United Nations. While Rae is a little too down-to-earth to talk in terms of destiny, he does have a lifetime of experience accumulated to help him pull off what this job demands. He attended a UN school in Geneva as a child when his father was posted there, and some of the friendships he forged in those days still endure. As premier from 1990 to 1995, Rae was intensely involved with constitutional negotiations in Canada and labour negotiations in Ontario; skills he will need at the UN. His legal and political work has taken him from Indigenous communities at home to refugee outposts around the world. Rae, in short, specializes in complicated situations — and the UN is going to be a complex place in a pandemic-wracked world. When asked to predict what he’d enjoy most about the new job, Rae says: “the scope and diversity of it …. I mean, there are very few jobs where you have as many different forces and countries and people at play.” He’s looking forward to living in New York too, as is Arlene Perly Rae; the two celebrated their 40th anniversary earlier this year. “I’ve never lived there before,” he says. “New York City itself is an interesting place.” But it does mean leaving the rather pleasant life that Rae created for himself after leaving politics — he thought for good. He laughs when asked whether he’d be doing a tone change of his social-media posts, which are often politically pointed; also funny. Rae says he’ll be diplomatic, but he won’t stop being himself. One of his friends joked to him this week that he was voluntarily putting the “harness” of duty back on. “I know what that’s like: your schedule is no longer your own, you’ve got to turn up and you’ve got to be here, you’ve got to be there …. I’m reporting to people and people are reporting to me and you’re part of a bigger system,” Rae says. He takes that on willingly, eagerly — it is now, in retrospect, where things were heading from the moment that Trudeau started doing all that thinking after the election and pulling Rae into that process. Saying no was not really an option. “I know there are people who are going to say ‘you’re getting pretty long in the tooth,’” he says. “I actually think as long as I’ve got my health and I’ve got my marbles, I think it’s worth making the effort. This really is a significant global crisis and to not be engaged in it would be wrong.”"
