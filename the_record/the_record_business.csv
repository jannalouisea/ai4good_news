In a statement sent Wednesday to The Record, the Waterloo-based company said the recent incident may have involved unauthorized access to an employee’s email inbox. “Our investigation revealed that the incident may have exposed a small number of individuals’ personal information,” the statement said. “We want to stress that we are not aware of any misuse of this information, and have notified individuals who may have been impacted and offered to cover the cost of credit monitoring for 12 months.” In a brief phone conversation, vice-president and chief financial officer Michele Falkins said the data breach affected less than 1.5 per cent of policyholders, but she would not disclose the total number of policyholders. Heartland’s website says it has more than 50,000 policies provincewide, but it’s not clear if that statistic is up to date. The Record obtained a copy of a letter, dated July 2 and printed on Heartland letterhead, stating the incident occurred between March 27 and April 3, and may have exposed names, addresses, banking information, social insurance and credit card numbers, driver’s licence information and, in some cases, passport information. “Protecting personal information is a top priority for us,” the statement released Wednesday said. Heartland said it immediately took steps to block the unauthorized access and secure the information, brought in a team of cybersecurity experts, and “engaged all relevant authorities.” “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Heartland Farm Mutual Inc. is committed to further improving its security in order to prevent this from happening again.” Falkins said Heartland would not be commenting further. Heartland specializes in agribusiness, rural and farm insurance. It was formed in 2016 through the merger of North Waterloo Farmers Mutual Insurance and Oxford Mutual Insurance."

Now, in the midst of the pandemic that’s ramped up stress levels and obliterated the line between work and home for many, the YMCAs of Cambridge & Kitchener-Waterloo are extending that mission to the workplace. A new program for workplaces will be developed by three people with extensive experience in workplace culture and employee well-being — Jim Moss, Dave Whiteside and Nate Robertson, all formerly of Plasticity Labs. Financial problems forced the Kitchener tech company out of business in April. Founded in 2013 by Moss and his wife, Jennifer, the firm developed a platform to improve workplace happiness and employee engagement and performance. As a Plasticity customer, the YMCA saw the benefits the platform brought to the charity’s own employees, said chief executive officer Peter Sweeney (the two YMCAs share a common organizational structure). “They helped us understand, through the insights of our employees, how best to make this a great place to work.” While the YMCA program won’t be focused on technology, the trio of ex-Plasticity staffers bring the experience needed as the Y embarks on this experiment. “They know how to work within the workplace context to uncover the emotional needs of employees,” said Sweeney, who reached out to Moss to propose the idea. COVID-19 has exposed some of the cracks in society, and some of those are rooted in the workplace, Sweeney said. Remote work has left many employees craving connection. Child care is a major strain on families right now. Front-line workers in sectors ranging from health care to retail are under unprecedented stress. “Would other organizations benefit from a non-profit like the Y coming in to help them understand what their employees need?” Sweeney asked. “This is an opportunity to test a theory.” For Moss, the new program presents an exciting challenge that turns the page on the difficult decision to close Plasticity Labs, one that left him feeling he’d failed employees that found themselves out of work. “I spent some time to distill what I learned about myself from the Plasticity experience,” he said. High on that list was the understanding that he cared deeply about improving the workplace experience for others. Specifics about how the program will work and what services may be offered are being considered, but they know a one-size-fits-all approach won’t work. “If you don’t come into it with an open mind, you’re in trouble,” Moss said. “We don’t pretend to have all the answers that workplaces need,” Sweeney added. “We’re willing to take a risk to try it.” Moss will lead the project, as vice-president, workplace well-being. Whiteside is a “powerhouse” in data collection and interpretation, Moss said, while Robertson, a skilled problem-solver with a background in design, will join the team part-time. The program will serve the local YMCAs’ coverage area, which includes Waterloo Region, Guelph and Stratford. As a social enterprise, proceeds from program fees will be reinvested in the charity. While it will be fee-based, the YMCA wants to ensure that all organizations, including non-profits, can participate. As the Y itself adapts to a changing COVID-19 landscape, “we have to be thinking about different ways to diversify our offerings,” Sweeney said. “We think it’s an innovative way for us to support our community.”"

Its technology, simplifying the photo and video production and editing process, has already been used behind-the-scenes in blockbusters like the 2019 remake of “The Lion King.” It’s in use for other film and television projects, too, ones that Monogram’s chief executive officer, Calvin Chu, says they’re “super-excited” about but can’t disclose due to confidentiality agreements. “We’re seeing more and more enterprises and larger studios using our tools,” he said. “It’s been spreading through word-of-mouth.” A new collaboration with Epic Games, the video gaming giant behind “Fortnite” and “Gears of War,” could further expand Monogram’s reach. The Monogram Creative Console, the modular system that swaps out a keyboard and mouse for a customizable series of dials, sliders and other controllers, will be integrated with Epic’s Unreal Engine. Unreal Engine is a game engine — essentially, the development software used to create the video games — but it’s gaining popularity among film and TV productions because of its ability to create and manipulate incredibly-realistic virtual locations and elements that can be blended in real time with traditional techniques.  The Star Wars series “The Mandalorian” is one example of a production that’s used Unreal Engine to create virtual sets. Epic Games awarded the Kitchener company a $50,000 grant to help develop Monogram’s Unreal Engine solution, allowing users to assign different Unreal Engine controls or connect their own custom plug-ins to Monogram modules.  “Monogram’s customizable hardware controller can unlock powerful tactile experiences in virtual worlds created in Unreal Engine,” Epic’s David Morin said in a release. Monogram technology was already compatible with popular photo, video and music production applications such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Lightroom Classic and Capture One. Whether it’s controlling lighting or colour balance, or even focusing or moving a virtual camera, the Creative Console can provide a customized workflow for production teams. The intuitive controls feel familiar to directors and cinematographers, said AJ Sciutto of Magnopus, the company in charge of creating a virtual production workflow for “The Lion King” last year. “It simplified the on-set experience, making it one of the crucial tools to our virtual production workflow,” Sciutto said in the release. Virtual production, which includes combining digital elements in real time with live action, rather than strictly in postproduction, was already gaining in popularity thanks to efficiencies and cost savings that don’t sacrifice quality.  Travel restrictions and physical distancing requirements brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic are proving the benefits of virtual production even more, with traditional shoots placed on hold. “We wanted to build the best tools that fit this new type of creator and new workflows that are constantly being invented,” Chu said. Virtual production blends leading-edge digital technology with cinematography techniques that have been refined for a century. “We’re excited to be at the cutting edge, and being able to work with the first handful of people who’ve started to pioneer this,” he said. Monogram is partnering with Sheridan College’s Screen Industries Research and Training Centre, located at Pinewood Toronto Studios, in the use of virtual production techniques. Monogram has also just moved to a new office at 305 King St. W. in downtown Kitchener, with a layout that offers more separate rooms and opportunity for distancing than their prior location. The company currently has 15 permanent employees and a few others on contract. Founded in 2013 as Palette, the company rebranded last year with the announcement of a new and improved version of its system, the Monogram Creative Console. Production and supply chain delays caused by the pandemic have slowed its release, but Chu said it’s expected to launch in a few weeks. “We’re just about ready to ship.” The Monogram hardware used in film and television production is identical to the consumer version; there will be an enterprise version of the software that’s a bit more specific to the studios’ needs. “All of the functionality we’ve built for Hollywood, making the hardware extremely reliable and professional quality, we’re bringing that to everybody,” Chu said."

The Kitchener-Waterloo Association of Realtors said sales were up 57.6 per cent over May’s statistics, with 673 homes sold last month. That’s even a 2.1 per cent increase over June 2019, and 8.5 per cent higher than the previous 10-year June average. “After a pandemic-induced delay to the typical spring market, home sales sprung back to life in a big way in June,” association president Colleen Koehler said in a news release. “As Waterloo Region entered stage two of reopening, we saw many buyers and sellers resuming their home buying and selling plans.” Sales plummeted in March following the declaration of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 crisis. April sales were the lowest the association had seen in a single month since December 2008. But things began to turn around in May, which saw an 80 per cent increase in the number of homes sold compared to April’s results. The average price of all residential properties sold in June rose 12.8 per cent compared to June 2019 to $601,285 — this is the first time the Kitchener-Waterloo association has seen the average price top $600,000. The average price for a detached home is quickly closing in on $700,000, rising 13.2 per cent year-over-year to $698,736. The median price for all properties rose 14.4 per cent in June to $564,000, while the median price for a detached home climbed nearly 12 per cent to $650,000. The June average price stood at $372,392 for an apartment-style condo, up 13.2 per cent. Townhomes rose 11.4 per cent to an average of $457,851, while semi-detached homes were up more than 17 per cent, to $504,816. It will still take some time for sales to completely recover from the impact of COVID-19. Open houses are still prohibited in Ontario, and face-to-face real estate business is discouraged; virtual tours and other technologies are taking their place. The association said total home sales in the second quarter were down 33 per cent compared to last year, and down 15.6 per cent on a year-to-date basis.　 “I expect for the remainder of 2020 (we’ll) see the number of home sales returning to near historical levels,” Koehler said. “There will be some catching up to do in the coming weeks, but I don’t think you will see the market taking a hiatus this summer.” Low inventory continues to drive prices higher. Although 920 new listings came on the market in the Kitchener and Waterloo area last month — the most new listings in a single month in more than a year — there were still only 640 homes available for sale at the end of June, down 28.7 per cent compared to last year. Homes took an average of 16 days to sell in June, compared to 20 days a year ago."

Finance Minister Carole James said the numbers are staggering with job losses of 235,000 since February and a predicted GDP decline of 6.8 per cent by the end of this year. “We were preparing for economic moderation, we were well-equipped to be able to weather the challenges,” James said at a news conference Tuesday. “What came next was unprecedented. Mere weeks after Budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed.” The government has provided $6.26 billion in financial aid to businesses and individuals. Among the losses it anticipates this fiscal year because of the pandemic are close to $1 billion in personal income tax, $973 million in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax, James said. The projected GDP decline in 2020 would be the worst on record going back to the 1980s, although it is also projected to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2021. James said for context, B.C.’s real GDP has only declined twice in the past 40 years, falling by 2.4 per cent in 2009 and 6.4 per cent in 1982. “As those numbers remind us, this could be the worst downturn experienced in our province recent history,” she said. B.C.’s restart plan is showing signs of hope for the economy as consumer confidence increases, she said. The unemployment rate is slowly rebounding and fewer wildfires and floods have helped the bottom line. However, she warned that the province’s financial forecast could change depending on many risk factors, including the possibility of a second wave of infections, the possibility of a vaccine, as well as the success of relief measures and central bank policy. Regardless of how B.C. copes with the pandemic, James said its economy is also subject to the economic health of other jurisdictions, particularly those that buy from the province. James said it wouldn’t help the economic recovery to pull back on spending, but the government will review every cent spent as it heads into the next budget year. The B.C. government has tabled legislation giving itself room for three years of deficits, which James said will be re-examined each year. James said she believes people care about provincial deficits because they understand it’s taxpayer money, but they also understand the emergency the pandemic created. She declined to predict how long the recovery would take, given the many moving pieces at play. “There is no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the economy of British Columbia and that’s not short term,” she said. The job losses have been widespread but some have been disproportionately affected, depending on a worker’s age, gender or which sector they work in, James said. Young workers are among the hardest hit, with the unemployment rate rising sharply from 9.1 per cent in February to 29.1 per cent in June for those aged 15 to 24. Women, who dominate the service industries and many of whom have also left jobs to care for family members, are another group more affected. Their unemployment rate rose from 4.8 per cent in February to 13.4 per cent in June. The hardest hit industries include wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services, construction, culture and recreation. The overall unemployment rate of 13 per cent remains at its highest level since 1987. While the job losses in March and April were record breaking, the figures for May and June have seen modest recovery as the economy started to reopen. “The projected numbers are staggering but they’re not without hope. Things are getting better each and every day when we follow the provincial health officer’s advice,” James said. The NDP government’s fiscal update was met with calls for an economic recovery plan by its political opponents, with the Opposition B.C. Liberals asking what happens when federal benefits like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit run out. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson also suggested the government should reconsider its pre-pandemic spending priorities. “People in every corner of B.C. have had to adjust to a new normal and adapt their household budgets, so why is this government pretending it’s business as usual?” he asked in a statement. The Green party said the province should transition to a green economy by helping traditional industries become more sustainable, spending on training and building local businesses into the supply chain. “We can seize the once in a generation opportunity to strategically drive stimulus spending towards a future British Columbians want: an innovative, low-carbon, sustainable, just and inclusive economy for all,” interim leader Adam Olsen said. — By Amy Smart in Vancouver.

They offer classes to members on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 7:30 a.m. in Liberty Village and Regent Park. They have spots for nine people in each session. All F45 locations are looking forward to reopening safely when the province gives the nod, Webster said, adding that they may continue outdoor classes if the demand is there. “We are going to prioritize the in-studio experience and the safety protocols there, but if there’s a way for us to continue doing the F45 Track, or the outdoor boot camps, then we may,” Webster said. F45 isn’t the only gym in the city that has adapted for COVID-19 protocols to retain and engage their clientele. At Sweat and Tonic on Yonge and Shuter streets, the first outdoor classes in mid-June were such a hit, the gym added more to its weekly schedule. Classes have nine participants, all social distancing, and range from HIIT, to yoga, to running. They take place either at 50 Gould St. on Ryerson’s Campus or at the Underpass Park at 29 Lower River St. Bolo, at 364 Richmond St. W., holds a strength and agility class Friday mornings at Stanley Park, outdoor boxing on Mondays at 6 p.m. at Canoe Landing and a run on Tuesday evenings. RedLeaf Fitness launched its outdoor programs June 25 outside the gym at 662 Caledonia Rd., and posted the socially distancing workout groups to its Instagram account. Some of these classes are open to non-members who can pay per class or for a number of classes. It’s different for every gym. Prices range from $20 and $45 per session depending on the activity. Sweat and Tonic charges $20 per outdoor fitness class. "

Energy and materials led the S&P/TSX composite index despite flattish oil prices and a dip in gold. Meanwhile, the heavyweight financials sector also climbed. In all, the Toronto index closed up 269.04 points or 1.7 per cent to 15,908.45. That’s the largest daily gain since June 5. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 556.79 points at 26,642.59. The S&P 500 index was up 42.30 points at 3,197.52, while the Nasdaq composite was up 97.73 points at 10,488.58. Second-quarter bank results were mixed but provisions for credit losses were much higher than expected at nearly US$27 billion for three banks. Shares of JPMorgan Chase increased after the drop in profits was less than expected on gains in capital markets while Citigroup shares dropped on a steep decline in profits. Wells Fargo sank 4.6 per cent after cutting its dividend and posting its first quarterly loss since the 2008 financial crisis. Bank executives said in conference calls that they underestimated how long the pandemic would last and its impacts on the overall economy. “I think you’re seeing weakness in the banks generally as some of the smaller regional banks are more heavily weighted towards lending and have less capital markets exposure so less of an offset as we proceed through earnings,” said Natalie Taylor, a portfolio manager with CIBC.  Meanwhile, she said there seems to be some flattening in the growth of COVID-19 infections outside of Florida despite larger outbreaks in some states. “The sense is that maybe the worst in the surge is either near or has already occurred,” she said in an interview. Taylor also said investor sentiment has improved on increased certainty that the U.S. Congress will pass another fiscal stimulus package by the end of the month to extend some income benefits and provide some support to state and local governments. “The market has continued to look through the spike in cases that we’re seeing in the states basically because we’re probably not going to see a broad shutdown of the economy again like we did in March and that there’s going to be stimulus on the other side,” she said. The Canadian dollar traded for 73.44 cents US compared with 73.71 cents US on Monday. Ten of the 11 major sectors on the TSX were higher with only real estate decreasing. Energy rose 4.1 per cent despite slight increases in crude oil and natural gas prices. Seven Generations Energy Ltd. rose 7.9 per cent while Whitecap Resources Inc. and Crescent Point Energy Corp. were up about six and 5.4 per cent respectively. The August crude contract was up 19 cents at US$40.29 per barrel and the August natural gas contract was up 0.7 of a cent at nearly US$1.75 per mmBTU. Taylor said the crude oil market is being affected by OPEC discussions about reducing product cuts, which she said would be “manageable in the context of the market.” In addition, former U.S. vice-president Joe Biden’s clean energy initiative unveiled Tuesday may not be as punitive for the oil and gas industry as may have been expected. Materials climbed three per cent with Kinross Gold Corp. up 5.4 per cent and B2Gold Corp. up 4.3 per cent despite lower metals prices.

Stage 3 of Ontario’s reopening allows indoor gatherings of up to 50 people with two-metre physical distancing still in effect. But gym and studio owners say operating at a significantly reduced capacity with little federal financial support might not be feasible and many may choose to stay closed or shut their doors for good. Jennifer Lau, owner of Toronto studio FitSquad, said the nature of the business means many independent gyms and studios don’t qualify for the federal wage subsidy, since their trainers are often contractors. With limitations still unclear, she said the smallest of these businesses may not be able to fit more than a handful of clients in their space. Some are tearing down walls to make more space to make it worthwhile, she said.  “We’re just waiting for the actual guidelines because right now it’s a little vague and there’s so much room for misinterpretation,” Lau said. “We’re doing our best.”  Lau is also the founder of the Save Health and Wellness Coalition, which has been advocating on behalf of studios like hers for a rent relief extension, among other things. The next six months to a year will be a struggle, she said, as it may be a while before gyms can allow more clients in. The coalition had pushed for studios to be included in Stage 2, since they are appointment-based — she likened them to tattoo studios, which were allowed to open. But to no avail. “Our industry is going to be hit so hard,” she said. When her 6,000-sq.-ft. studio does reopen, it will be at 30 to 40 per cent capacity, or a maximum of 20 people including staff, more than many studios that have smaller square footage. She said trainers and clients will work in pods, and classes will be limited to between eight and 10 people. But many studios are trying to decide whether reopening will save their business or prolong its inevitable closure. That’s the situation in which Portia Albrecht finds herself. Albrecht owns the Generate fitness studio in Bloor West Village, a larger independent gym at around 6,000 sq. ft. that offers barre, yoga and spinning classes and has a weight training and equipment area as well. Albrecht, who is currently working as a nurse in Boston, doesn’t know whether or not she’ll be able to reopen her studio, even with the federal rent relief program.  “It doesn’t look good,” she said. It’s not just the reduced capacity or the increased costs — she’s also not sure people are ready to return to the gym. Albrecht surveyed her clients and found that fewer than 30 per cent were willing to return to the gym right away. And for those who are willing, she’s concerned nervousness about the pandemic could overtake the feeling of community and cause friction between clients. She believes the rent relief program should be extended, though even that might not be enough for Generate, she said — her rent alone is $25,000 a month, but there are many other costs as well, and it’s not a hugely profitable industry to begin with. “It’s going to take a long time to build the numbers back up to where they need to be.”  Alex Kucharski, a director of the Ontario Independent Fitness Studio Association and an F45 studio owner in Toronto, said many gyms and studios have pivoted to online and outdoor classes to stay afloat, but that these offerings are not sustainable. He believes small studios have an advantage over the big gyms because they are generally a more controlled environment, with planned classes instead of walk-ins. Kucharski said independent fitness studios are often beloved members of the business community — and many have already closed their doors for good, including Toronto Newsgirls Boxing Club, a boxing gym that focused on women and trans people as clients. Some gyms have taken to their community to stay afloat. For example, Bloor Street Fitness & Boxing has a GoFundMe campaign with a goal of $80,000 — donor comments call the gym inclusive and socially focused.  Kevin Charles, who owns an F45 studio in Toronto, said the rent relief program and federal $40,000 loan could help his studio stay open, since the wage subsidy doesn’t apply to his subcontracted employees. Both he and his landlord are in the process of applying to these programs. He has been offering online classes “out of necessity” to help cover his bills, and hopes the rent relief and loan programs will kick in soon, as he will be operating at a third of his usual capacity when he can reopen the studio. Charles is doing everything he can to help his clients feel safe returning. He recently purchased an electrostatic sprayer to more efficiently and effectively disinfect the space and equipment. He hopes the rent relief program is continued to help small businesses like his weather the next several months."

The 77-year-old Bollywood patriarch’s image is ubiquitous across the country on advertisements for everything from hair oil to cement, and his infection — along with actor son Abhishek, daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai and granddaughter Aaradhya — ignited something akin to an outpouring of national grief. Bachchan’s illness also highlighted one of India’s most acute and chronic inequalities that’s been accentuated by the pandemic: access to quality health care. He and his son were hospitalized in one of Mumbai’s best private hospitals, although they had only mild symptoms, at a time when ordinary citizens have been struggling to find a bed in crowded state-run hospitals, or are being denied medical care by private facilities outright. As India struggles to contain the world’s third-largest outbreak — adding nearly 30,000 new cases every day — such inequalities will make it even harder to stem the pathogen’s spread. “The double standard is the rich get treated in India and the poor don’t,” said Leena Menghaney, a lawyer and public health activist based in New Delhi. “That’s very starkly played out in the fact Amitabh Bachchan has survived tuberculosis, he’s survived hepatitis B, and now he will get some of the best treatment for COVID-19.” As the outbreak intensified in recent months, government hospitals have become overwhelmed — especially in Mumbai and New Delhi, the two worst-hit cities. Widely reported instances of some private hospitals and doctors refusing to treat COVID-19 patients have been blamed for deepening the crisis. The private sector accounts for around 60 per cent of India’s total hospital bed capacity. Shocking stories abound: a patient in Mumbai was asked to sleep on the floor until a bed was available in state-run facility, while another woman suffering brain damage was turned away by private hospitals which would not treat her unless she had a certificate proving she was virus-free. A pregnant woman died in May after being denied help by three private hospitals in the outskirts of Mumbai. Virus Dashboard The health care facilities in Mumbai have since been bolstered, with the local government taking over 80 per cent of the beds in private hospitals, drafting doctors into compulsory virus duty and setting up a dashboard showing the availability of beds for COVID-19 patients. But the speed and ease with which citizens can access these facilities differs. In June, a government survey conducted by Ayushman Bharat, an agency that administers a health insurance scheme for the poor, found that 22 of 101 private hospitals had provided so few services that they were deemed inactive. Out of a group of 96 private hospitals asked if they’d provided any COVID-19 treatment, 81 said no. The Bachchans encountered no such difficulties when they fell ill and were admitted to Mumbai’s Nanavati Hospital, a private facility close to their home. Bachchan emerged as Bollywood’s premier superstar in the 1970s and is seen as India’s answer to Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino, playing “angry young men” characters battling corrupt establishments. While other actors of his generation have seen their fame fade away, Bachchan has only grown in stature. Besides dozens of endorsement deals and critically acclaimed film work, he also hosts the Indian edition of “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” and cameod in the 2013 Hollywood film, “The Great Gatsby.” His son Abhishek, also a superstar, is married to actor and former beauty queen Aishwarya Rai in one of Asia’s most famous and photogenic unions. “He’s considered to be sort of a national treasure so if something happens to Amitabh Bachchan it’s considered to be a failure of the government,” said Menghaney, the health care activist in Delhi. Slum Dwellers Despite the Bachchans’ infection, COVID-19 remains largely a disease of the poor in India, with hot spots concentrated in slums and tenements where social distancing is all but impossible. Many there depend on daily wages and cannot work from home. And even if beds are available in private hospitals, few can afford them. As the lockdown is eased across India and Mumbai’s elite start allowing their cleaners, cooks and drivers to return to their homes, the health of the city’s richest people will remain intertwined with its poorest. “The private health-care system has completely failed on this occasion. The message is that if you don’t pay to take care of the health of the poorest, the richest are also not going to be safe,” said T. Sundararaman, the New Delhi based global co-ordinator of the People’s Health Movement, a health care access advocacy group. “Therefore universal access to health care should be seen as a universal public good.”"

As senior director of principal gifts for the University of Texas at Austin, he helped set goals for his team of fundraisers, assisted them in meeting those goals and celebrated their successes when they did. He aimed to be supportive and encouraging, but delving into staffers’ personal lives? Inquiring about their support networks? That wasn’t part of the job description. But as the country abruptly shut down in one unimaginable week in March, Spearman, like many managers at companies large and small, found himself taking on new roles: counsellor, supporter, wellness coach. Goals and metrics temporarily went out the window. The mental and physical health of his staff became the priority. As Spearman scheduled one-on-one meetings with each member of his team, he wrote a checklist of things to talk about: Where are you living? How comfortable are you going out? Are you getting food delivery? Do you feel safe? He also invited each team member to share their biggest fears. “That was a watershed moment,” he said. One of his employees is married to an assistant manager at a grocery store, and the thought of him going to work every day terrified her. Another feared that her partner, who worked in the hospitality industry, would lose his job. One person was scared of being sick and alone, another worried about an elderly parent living in another state. At the same time Spearman shared his biggest fear: that he would get sick and not be able to get a test for the virus. It was the most vulnerable he’d ever been with his staff. “I wanted to let them know I’m in the same boat,” he said. As businesses grapple with the economic fallout and disruption caused by the coronavirus, experts say the pandemic may have a silver lining: Helping to create a new breed of managers — those who talk less and listen more. “There is an element of this crisis that is forcing managers to be the kind of managers people always wanted, which is really caring about their team’s welfare, and really listening,” said David Rock, director of the Neuroleadership Institute and author of “Your Brain at Work.” Inquiring after the well-being of employees and understanding their unique challenges has always been part of good management strategy, said Samuel Culbert, author of the book “Good People/Bad Managers” and a professor at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management. Before the pandemic, it may have been easier to gloss over. Today, however, knowing who may have recently lost a loved one, and who is chasing after a toddler half the day, has become essential information for any team leader. “Most managers may intend to help their employees, but they don’t start off with the most basic questions: What do you need? How can I help you?” Culbert said. A manager may not be able to solve everyone’s problems, he added, “but you can listen, give, support and back them up.” As the weeks passed and Spearman’s team settled into their new reality, he gradually turned the focus back to fundraising goals. But the more intimate relationships he established in the early days of the pandemic remained. “This has been a transformative experience for me,” he said. “We talk about productivity, but we also talk about canoeing and coffee with friends. I’m learning to manage that whole person, not just the performer.” Studies suggest that the stresses associated with COVID-19 are affecting people on every rung of the corporate ladder. In a global survey of 2,700 people, the technology company Qualtrics found that self-reported declines in mental health in the early days of the pandemic were equally likely across all seniority levels — from executives (40.5 per cent) to individual contributors (44 per cent). “Nobody is going through this unscathed,” said Ryan Smith, chief executive of Qualtrics. Supervisors may worry that inquiring after the mental health of their employees is inappropriate, or none of their business, but the data suggest otherwise. The Qualtrics survey found that 57.7 per cent of respondents said they are comfortable with their manager proactively asking them about their mental health, and 41 per cent said they want their managers to ask them about it. And when respondents were asked who they would rather talk to about mental health issues, 35.6 per cent said a co-worker or peer, 33.5 per cent said a manager or supervisor, and just 19.5 per cent said somebody from Human Resources. “Traditionally, mental health has been one of those taboo topics — don’t ask, don’t tell,” said Michael Thompson, president and CEO of National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, a non-profit employer group. “But when you break the silence, employees like it. They think more highly of you as an employer.” At the same time, many managers are experiencing their own fears and challenges, and experts say it is important for them to monitor their mental health as well. “You have to get your own stress level low enough so you can focus on someone else,” Culbert said. He recommends a buddy system in which managers check in on one another and share challenges and stressors. Smith is already doing this. Before the pandemic he had a standing weekly call with 12 other tech CEOs, but after COVID-19 upended everything the conversation took on a new tone. “It’s turned into a therapy group,” he said. Felicia Jadczak was expecting 2020 to be a year of growth for She+ Geeks Out, the Boston company she co-founded that helps companies create a more inclusive workforce and runs networking events in tech and tech-adjacent fields. As the country went into lockdown, Jadczak’s anxiety grew as client meetings got cancelled, contracts vanished and sponsors began pulling out of She+ Geeks Out events. At the same time, she and her co-CEO, Rachel Murray, had to transition their small staff to working from home, which meant ensuring everyone had a functioning internet connection and a suitable space to work. But the biggest hurdle was emotional, Jadczak said, “just understanding what everyone was going through — not just the team but me and my business partner, too.” Some employees had small children at home, others were supporting older family members. “Every meeting started with, how are you? Is your family safe? Are you OK? And really listening,” Jadczak said. The two women say they don’t mind taking on these additional responsibilities, but they require emotional energy. As Jadczak put it, “It’s a lot of lift.” After the news of the police killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor began circulating, Jadczak and Murray added a weekly meeting to the team’s agenda that they call “the hang” — as in hang out. “We found that our team needed some time to come together and process and chat like we were in the office, around the coffee machine,” she said. They also experimented with giving everyone, including themselves, a four-day workweek. Even as the demand for their training services has skyrocketed in the wake of the national reckoning on racism sparked by George Floyd’s killing, Jadczak and Murray plan to continue with four-day workweeks. “We don’t want anyone to burn out,” Jadczak said. Tracy Keogh, chief human resources officer at HP Inc., which has 55,000 employees worldwide, said her team has also worked to alleviate burnout by urging employees to shift 30-minute Zoom calls to 25 minutes, and hour-long calls to 55 minutes. It may not seem like much, but the small breaks make a difference. Here in Los Angeles, Merrick Lackner, co-founder of Rently, a company that helps renters see homes and apartments without a listing agent, said the coronavirus has helped him to get to know his 50 employees in a whole new way. “Ironically, it’s easier to make surface-level assumptions about people when you see them every day,” he said. “But with everyone apart, we’ve been having deeper, more honest conversations.” Since the pandemic started, Lackner has made more of an effort to reach out beyond his direct reports to find out how other staffers are doing, and hear what they think should be happening at the company. “To be frank, I should have been doing it all along,” he said. As for Spearman, he’s learned that he doesn’t have to pry into his employees’ lives to let them know he’s available to talk if that’s what they need. It’s like having someone to your house and offering them coffee and a cookie, he said. They don’t need to take it, but it’s nice to know it’s there."

On a single income of $70,000, is it time to leave the city?",['Evelyn KwongToronto Star'],"Mon., Jan. 13, 2020","They’re both just 26 years old, but Amy and Jake are already the parents of a 10-month-old baby and a French bulldog. Their family lives in Toronto’s High Park area, renting a place for $1,830 per month. They had to find it quickly — they were kicked out of their previous apartment when the landlord’s daughter needed a place to stay after university. “(We) really struggled to find an apartment that fit our budget that could accommodate Jake being six-foot-two,” Amy says. “We ended up paying way more than we wanted, but we don’t plan to stay long.” With no debts, they have dreams of buying a home outside the Greater Toronto Area to start their family. But recently Amy suffered health problems that prevented her from returning to work after the pregnancy. Read more Millennial Money here.  Now, they live on a single income of $70,000 — earned by Jake who’s a software developer. “We live a very modest lifestyle, but things are still tight living on one income,” she says. On top of the goal of buying a home within two to five years, the couple is also hoping they can start an Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) for their baby. They say that they’re not big spenders and make frugal day-to-day choices to boost their savings. “We try to home cook as much as possible,” says Amy. Breakfast and dinner are almost always made at home. For lunches, Jake takes leftovers to work, but occasionally grabs a sandwich to go or heads to a restaurant with colleagues. Sometimes, with his stressful work schedule, he’ll opt for a snack from the vending machine. At home, Amy’s schedule is also jam-packed. With the doctor’s checkups, taking the baby to free play groups, walking the dog and grabbing groceries, the errands can pile up.  On the weekend the couple have a bit more time to indulge their interests, such as geocaching — an outdoor activity using GPS to play hide-and-seek with containers marked in specific locations — and taking part in free community events with the baby.  The two want to move out of their expensive rental spot soon and hope a financial adviser can provide some clear direction on how to start. We asked them to share everything they bought in a typical week: The advice: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners, says it sounds like Jake and Amy are having a tough time financially with the decrease in income due to Amy’s health problem and the added stress of a new baby to provide for, coupled with a new, more expensive rental. Here’s his advice: > Living outside the GTA could have a big impact on their cost of living. There are surrounding suburbs and towns with considerably lower real estate prices. The potential commute into the GTA is a real consideration, though. There’s a cost to that — both literal and figurative — especially when you’re raising a family.  > Amy’s health problems highlight a real risk for them. What happens if something prevents Jake from working? They’re paying health premiums, but don’t appear to have life or disability insurance — they should get on that.  > I’d also question the health premiums. They’re paying out of their bank accounts, so this makes me think it’s not a company or group plan, but rather an individual health insurance plan. I’d take a close look at what is actually being covered currently, and what could actually be covered based on the plan maximums. > The RESP is a great idea for their little one. That said, given cash flow is tight, and their child isn’t even a year old, I’d maybe hold off for a while. RESPs provide 20 per cent government grants on your contributions up to $2,500 per year. But you can catch up on a full previous year in a future year. > They may not have a car payment now, but they will eventually have to budget for a replacement. Especially if they move outside the GTA. > Despite the common advice to start saving for retirement while you’re young, I’d really be focused on getting through these lean years with a newborn and hopefully getting Amy back to work and getting into a cheaper rental. Overall, there are pros to the way they are living, Heath says. “Good on them for cutting costs with mostly home cooking. Their minimal spending on coffees and lunches will help keep their expenses low at a time when their cash flow is tight.” The results: They actually spent more in the second week (but it was the holidays!) Spending in week 1: $611.16. Spending in week 2: $821.45. What she thought: Amy and Jake say that despite spending more, they did “quite well” seeing as it was the holiday season — therefore gifts galore! “This week was a bit unusual for us leading into Christmastime with buying gifts for family, drinks for a Friendsmas party and extra gas for driving to our parents’ houses.” Take-aways: Being a cautious pair, the couple says that Heath’s advice helped affirm several things they were already hoping to do. First, they’ve decided to cancel their health insurance after crunching the numbers. Also, following the advice, they’re holding off on the RESP contributions for the baby until they have more cash flow.  Another big change? They’ve moved up their timeline to leave Toronto. “We love it here, but it really doesn’t make financial sense to live here anymore, especially now that Jake has five years of post-university work experience and can apply to a wider range of jobs in less expensive cities,” Amy adds. After doing the #MillennialMoney challenge, they say it was reassuring to find out that they’re doing a good job of limiting their spending.  “It’s nice to have an expert affirm things that we felt in our gut.”"

With a bit of time and effort, you can be — and it will almost certainly lead to a stronger financial position. Here are five ways to become money smart:  Make a date with yourself every week to work on your finances Financially literate people spend at least 20 minutes a week learning about money matters and staying on top of their finances. They read about wealth, meet with advisers, work on their budget and pay bills.  Whether they like the subject of money or not, immersing themselves in financial learning every week helps the financially literate stay on top of financial goals.  Carve out time every week to start learning about money. There are literally thousands of free resources online, and hundreds of documentaries to watch. Start with a search about how to save more money. Investigate lenders before committing to one In a recent survey conducted by Loans Canada, nearly 40 per cent of respondents — all of whom were already indebted — skipped out on comparing offers from lenders. Unfortunately, loan stacking — having multiple loans from multiple vendors — tends to be a result of not being strategic about what you borrow for, and from which lender. And that stack of debt can be tough to handle efficiently. Comparing loan terms, rates, frequency and amount of payments allows you to make an informed decision and gives you leverage to negotiate with competitive offers. And it’s fairly easy to do through online loan and rate comparison websites.  Work your budget A 2019 Government of Canada financial capability survey found that Canadians who stick to a budget — about half of those surveyed — are better able to stay on top of their spending. People who budget also tend to have squirreled away enough savings for emergencies and retirement plans. One of the biggest barriers that non-budgeters say gets in the way is a lack of time. There are, however, hundreds of digital tools to speed up the process compared to even a decade ago. And if you prefer to keep your banking separate from your budget, you could use a free Google budgeting template. Keep a pulse on your credit score Financially literate people keep an eagle eye on their credit score to prevent fraud and to monitor their progress toward improving it. Generally speaking, a score less than 600 is suboptimal with 900 being the highest. Paying bills on time and in full and reining in your credit cards is the best way to improve your credit score.  And there are plenty of free credit score tracking services like CreditKarma.  Seek the advice of a qualified professional  When it comes to your personal finances, never guess. There’s just too much at stake. If you don’t know what to do about your finances, or you are just unsure, get help.  Having low financial self-awareness is dangerous and generally leads to poor money decisions. Working with a professional, even if it’s just for the short-term, can help improve your financial self-awareness and increase your financial literacy. "

Can they afford a home?",['Evelyn KwongToronto Star'],"Mon., March 2, 2020","Emily and Tom are both 26 years old. Emily, a registered nurse makes $69,000 a year, while Tom, an apprentice tradesman, makes $44,000. Their monthly spending adds up to around $6,000, and the $300 to $800 left over goes straight into paying off debt. “We’re looking to buy a house ASAP,” Emily said. What’s the rush? The couple, who currently rent a home in Scarborough, just found out they’re expecting. “Ideally we’d settle in Whitby, but our budget for homes is under $300,000,” she said. The two also say London is a good option to look at, but before real estate becomes a reality, Emily still has to pay off $12,000 in OSAP debt and Tom has to pay off $5,000 remaining of a consolidation loan from a fitness membership that went wrong.  “Hopefully we can pay it off by the middle of next year,” Emily said, adding they are eager to start their family life. They’ve tried to be frugal to make their dreams a reality. In a typical workday, Emily and Tom pack a lunch. Emily will treat herself to a Starbucks drink three times a month while Tom buys a coffee and breakfast once a week. “Also, we both eat out from a fast-food restaurant once or twice a month.”  On the weekends, the two are typically homebodies unless they’re going to a friend’s house. Also for their date nights, they try to find ways to budget. “We never go out to drink, we go on dates maybe once every three months and typically spend just shy of $100 per date with food included.”  Their two largest monthly spends? $1,695 split between the two of them on rent, more than $700 on car insurance, about $550 on groceries and $400, which is non-negotiable, for charity. On top of their more realistic goals, the couple is hoping to finally go on vacation for the first time. “We’d also like to go to either Disney World, Ireland, or the Caribbean for our first vacation sometime in the next few years,” Emily says. We asked the couple to send in a sample of their weekly expenses for a #MillennialMoney expert to examine. Here’s what happened. The expert: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners Inc., has advice for the couple, who he says, has an exciting year ahead. > It sounds like the home budget is pretty modest at $300,000. They will need a minimum 5% down payment or $15,000. > As they are considering a home purchase, remember that with babies come changes in income and expenses. I’m sure some sort of a parental leave for one or both of them will reduce their combined income for a period of time. EI maternity and parental benefits will replace only a portion of their incomes. > I would focus the extra $300 to $800 leftover cash each month on Tom’s consolidation loan. It is likely the interest rate is higher than Emily’s OSAP loan rate.  > Debt repayment may be a better option than investing given the interest rates they’re paying, especially given their time horizon for a home purchase seems short. It’s not wise taking risk to invest if you may need your money in a short period of time. > One thing to consider while Emily is off work is she may have the opportunity to buy back service in her pension plan. This is often a good opportunity to take advantage of and she should consider it during or after her maternity leave. > Having a baby is a good time to re-evaluate insurance coverage and estate planning. Both Emily and Tom may need more life insurance. If they don’t already have wills and powers of attorney, they should consider them in advance of their new addition to the family. > It’s hard to criticize generous philanthropists, but this couple should consider whether an expected decrease in income and increase in expenses should cause them to reconsider their $400 per month in donations, even if it is just temporarily.  The results: They spent less. Spending in week 1: $2,262. Spending in week 2: $551.91. What Emily thought: Compared to last week, the couple is proud of how little they spent. “We will save from there,” Emily said. Next goals: “We’d like to reduce spending on snacks and coffee.” Added bonus, Tom will no longer need to use the 407 toll to go to work as he did in week 2, which will mean more savings.  Take-aways: With help from the Millennial Money expert, now Emily and Tom have shifted into looking more seriously into how to buy a home. “We will likely have to rent to save up for a down payment and maybe will need to pay off debts before purchasing a house as well,” Emily said.  In addition to that, the two had already planned to transfer any child tax benefits into an RESP, so they were glad to hear this affirmed by the financial coach as the “best investment strategy.” Despite the desperation to pay off debts, the couple agree their charitable contributions are still not debatable, and that they will continue to give just as much.  Instead, they’ve found different areas to save money. “Emily’s family lives here, and they have offered child care which would offset child care costs with her return to work,” Tom added. "
13,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/business/2019/02/08/how-a-home-equity-line-of-credit-works-and-what-it-might-really-cost.html,How a home equity line of credit works - and what it might really cost,['The Canadian Press'],"Fri., Feb. 8, 2019","OTTAWA - A home equity line of credit may be a cheap and easy way to borrow money to pay off your lingering holiday bills or consolidate high-interest debt, but experts caution that you need a plan to repay the money. They say it is all too easy to only make the minimum monthly payments to cover the interest and never make any progress on reducing the amount you owe. ""It is so easy to stay in debt for a long, long period of time,"" says Scott Hannah, chief executive of the Credit Counselling Society. Hannah says consolidating high-interest debt using a home equity line of credit that charges a lower rate of interest can be a good plan, but you need to understand how much you can afford to borrow, the interest rate you are going to be charged and how are you going to repay it. Too often, he says, a HELOC is used by those who are spending more than they earn to cover daily expenses. ""It can really mask spending behaviour, it can really mask the fact that a person may not be managing their financial affairs well,"" Hannah says. A HELOC is secured by the value of your home while the interest rate charged is normally linked to the big bank prime rates and fluctuates as that rate changes. The Bank of Canada has raised its key interest rate target five times since the middle of 2017, moves that have driven up the cost of borrowing. A report by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada says HELOCs are the largest contributor to nonmortgage consumer debt, more than double that of either credit cards or auto loans. However, Michael Toope, a spokesperson for the agency, says the survey found many consumers don't understand how the lines of credit work. ""People are not very familiar with the terms and conditions of the loans, these lines of credit, and they generally don't have great plans for paying them back,"" he said. Just 15 per cent of HELOC holders knew that a financial institution can increase an interest rate at its discretion, while 45 per cent knew there are fees to transfer a HELOC to another institution. The FCAC survey also found that one in five HELOC holders borrowed more than they intended. The most popular use of a HELOC, according to the survey, was for home renovations at 49 per cent, while 22 per cent said they used their HELOC for debt consolidation. Toope says if you are going to use a HELOC you need to know what the money is going to be used for and how you are going to pay it back. ""You need to know why you are borrowing that money or why do you need that line of credit,"" he said. Hannah says if you have a plan and understand the risks, a HELOC can be helpful. ""A low rate line of credit is a good product if used properly and with a specific purpose,"" he says."

Resolve to make contributions to an RESP (registered education savings plan) that allows the funds to grow on a tax-deferred basis."" - James McCreath, portfolio manager, The McCreath Group, BMO Nesbitt Burns Private Client Division  ""This winter, resolve to keep warm by dressing for the temperature. Don't leave your car running to keep it warm. If you are parked and waiting, turn off your vehicle. Idling can burn one to two litres of gas per hour, while restarting your car only uses about 10 seconds worth of fuel."" - Kristine D'Arbelles, senior manager of public affairs, Canadian Automobile Association  ""Budget permitting, resolve to maximize your charitable tax credit by giving more than $200 for the year. For every dollar you give beyond that amount, you get a 29 per cent tax credit federally, and you may reach over 50 per cent tax credit when you factor in the provincial credit. Remember that this credit is also transferable between spouses and can be carried forward for five years."" - Gerry Vittoratos, Canadian tax software company UFile  ""Resolve to be patient with yourself. Purchasing a gym membership will seem like a great investment when you achieve results. Also, choose a location that is convenient for you, speak to a fitness professional about your options and check to see if your employer has a corporate rate."" - Jason Sheridan, senior vice-president of operations, GoodLife Fitness  ""Resolve to save money, live comfortably and reduce pollution by upgrading your lighting, insulation and appliances at home and at work to energy-efficient alternatives to reduce your utility bills. Use the sun's free energy with renewable energy technologies to meet your heating and power demands."" - Saeed Kaddoura, analyst, Pembina Institute  ""Book your flights early. The closer you get to departure date, the prices can often be more costly and selection can be limited. And book with a travel agent - they can provide plenty of price options to maximize your savings and minimize layover times."" - Gary Howard, vice-president marketing, CAA Atlantic"

We’re not even close to that moment when it comes to Ottawa’s COVID-19 spending, but that feeling is starting to set in. So far, deficit spending has reached $343 billion this year covering everything from wage subsidies and unemployment benefits to money for seniors, students, rent relief and loans to business. It may look like some politicians believe we can spend our way out of the economic shock, recession, and, perhaps, depression headed our way. But what if tax dollars aren’t the only way to free up much needed investment dollars? What if there was a way to encourage Canadians to use their own capital to provide stimulus and support Canadian business? Wealthy Canadians and corporations are holding cash and there are few incentives for them to invest in private Canadian businesses.  While the 2008 global economic crisis hit the big banks hardest, today’s calamity has struck a death blow to small business with little in the way of assistance coming from Ottawa. That’s not to say a few small loan programs haven’t been helpful; they just haven’t moved the needle, and many small business owners have been reluctant to take on the risk of additional debt. A recent survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business found that 25 per cent of small businesses will close their doors if they sustain a 50-per-cent drop in revenue for a month. Many Canadian business owners are already well past that point. This is a tragedy. Small businesses are the heart and soul of the Canadian economy. If you are a successful small business owner who has built a nest egg over many years, it is unlikely you will double down during a pandemic and reinvest your savings to keep your business afloat. If you are evaluating an investment in, for example, a tech company looking for additional capital, the risks have increased significantly.  Unlocking private capital would provide additional support from Canadians who are not only looking for a return, but are also emotionally invested in the business’s success. We’ve seen grassroots, microscale economic support for small business in communities across the country, including from community crowdfunding platform Distantly.ca, which enables individuals to send funds directly to local businesses. The platform was conceived to make sure Mainstreet was still open post lock down. Businesses such as restaurants, salons and gyms, which are closing their doors daily, would benefit greatly from an incentive for Canadians to make a much bigger commitment with that support. Small businesses have a desperate need for capital to invest in digital transformation, working capital, personal protective equipment and other modifications required to comply with new pandemic regulations. If Canada is going to emerge from this crisis stronger and more resilient, we need tax policy to encourage Canadians to invest in our small businesses. We are not looking for anything unique or groundbreaking here. A handful of Canadian provinces have tax policy that encourages private investment in small business. New Brunswick has the Small Business Investor Tax Credit program, the most generous in the country. If you live in New Brunswick and invest in a small business, you get a personal income tax credit of 50 per cent of your investment up to maximum of $125,000 annually. Corporations, trusts, co-ops and local economic development agencies are entitled to similar benefits upon investment. In the last five years, the program has generated almost $450 million of investment, supporting 2,200 small businesses in New Brunswick.  The federal government needs a bold, game-changing tax policy that will encourage Canadians with capital, including small business owners, to step off the sidelines and invest in small business. We must establish qualifying parameters that encourage small businesses to grow. We must set the bar high in defining “small business,” so we don’t discourage growth.  The U.S. does this well. Section 1202 of its tax code allows for tax-free capital gains of up to $10 million or 10-times the investment if it is in a private business with up to $50 million in assets. It’s a bold idea. That is easy to implement, were Ottawa so inclined. As New Brunswick did, the federal government could provide an income tax credit to Canadians for investment in small- and medium-sized businesses. Business owners who double down and reinvest in their own business, could get a tax holiday on income earned, or charge no tax on dividends paid, for up to three-times the invested capital. For investors looking to back potential high-growth entrepreneurs, the program could provide tax-free capital gains — up to tenfold.  Ottawa has the power to do all of the above.  High-income earners in Canada pay more than half of their income to the government, not including municipal and sales tax. Why not create a plan where Canadians can choose to provide private stimulus and invest in the small businesses and entrepreneurs so vital to the Canadian economy? "

And if the pollsters in the States are correct, that’s exactly what is going to happen. Biden appears to have a wide lead at this point. Of course, a lot can happen in four months. But if the status quo holds, what would a Biden win mean for investors and the Canadian economy? Potentially, a lot. So far, the former vice-president hasn’t unveiled much in terms of his platform. But his first major policy statement sent shock waves through the oilpatch and cheered environmentalists. In mid-May, the Biden campaign announced that one of his first acts as president would be to rescind the permit allowing TC Energy to build the Keystone XL pipeline. That action would kill the project once and for all. President Barack Obama rejected Keystone on the grounds that it would contribute significantly to climate change. As his VP, Biden strongly supported the move, so it’s no surprise he would act quickly to reverse Trump’s approval of the project. That would be a huge blow to heavy oil producers and to the province of Alberta, which is investing $1.5 billion to cover construction costs to the end of 2020. That’s a lot of tax dollars down the drain if Biden indeed pulls the plug. The Keystone XL announcement is a clear tip-off to what else we might expect from a Biden presidency. It would probably be the greenest administration in U.S. history, especially if the Democrats are able to retain control of the House and wrest the Senate from the Republicans. The Green New Deal put forward by the party’s left wing is a smorgasbord of ideas aimed at tackling climate change on a grand scale. Some of the proposals are probably unworkable, such as upgrading every building in the U.S. to meet specific environmental standards. But it is likely that a Biden administration would promote some of its key goals, including the use of green energy at the expense of fossil fuels, and subsidizing electric vehicles and low-emission high-speed trains. Under Biden, the U.S. would almost certainly rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and we should expect a lot of reregulation in the environmental sector, reversing the deregulation of the Trump years. Relations with Canada should improve significantly. Biden does not believe in using tariffs as a political lever. He and Prime Minister Trudeau share many of the same views and profess to be good friends.  In other areas, I would expect a Biden government to roll back some or all of Trump’s prized $1.5 trillion (all figures U.S.) in corporate and personal tax cuts. The plan was passed in 2017, when the Republicans still controlled the House. Not one Democrat voted for it. The cuts provided a huge boost for corporate profits but, instead of investing the money in plants, equipment and jobs as the government hoped, billions were spent on share buybacks and raising dividends. That caused a backlash that extended to Capitol Hill and is still simmering. The Trump administration was running a huge deficit even before the emergency spending for the pandemic. The Congressional Budget Office now projects a shortfall of close to $4 trillion this year. That means the cupboard will be bare if Biden takes office in January. What better way to start replenishing it than by rolling back those tax cuts? Canada would be an indirect beneficiary if that were to happen as it would restore the tax advantage we offered to corporations before the Trump cuts. How would stocks react to all this? If recent history is any indication, the markets would rise in the first year of a Biden presidency. That has been the pattern in every year but one since 1985. The exception was 2001, the first year that George W. Bush was in office, when Sept. 11 sent the market tumbling. Stocks will not respond well to a boost in corporate taxes or an overaggressive climate policy. But they would get a big lift if a coronavirus vaccine is developed and an economic recovery appears to be underway if and when Biden takes office. One thing we can say with certainty: a Biden presidency would be light years removed from the turmoil of the Trump years. That would come as a relief for a lot of people."

It’s Canada’s problem, too. The range of potential harms to Canada include supply-chain disruptions and renewed American protectionist sanctions against Canadian industry. That’s in addition to the hammer-blow the prolonged pandemic has already dealt to Canada’s vast tourism, hospitality and conventions sector, deprived of U.S. business and vacation travellers. Americans getting sicker instead of healthier — opposite to what their northern neighbours have achieved — has so far not significantly diminished the roughly $1 billion in daily trade between the two countries. But that changes if the “rocket-ship” economic recovery that U.S. President Donald Trump promised Americans last month fails to materialize, with U.S. elections just four months away. A promising U.S. economic rebound from mid-April into June has stopped far short of full recovery. And some sectors, notably retail, are back in decline. Fear of infection is keeping Americans out of stores that have reopened after lockdown. So is the lack of a second round of U.S. pandemic relief cheques, in sharp contrast to the continued flow of federal income supports in Canada and the European Union (EU).  Weakness in U.S. consumer sentiment will eventually inflict damage on Canadian online retail and business-to-business sales in the U.S. market. It will also harm Canadian firms doing business directly in the U.S., including Canadian banks, insurers, retailers and property developers. If the stall-out in the U.S. economic recovery continues into the fall, the economic pain for Canada will spread from tourism and retailing into the Canadian manufacturing, resource and agricultural sectors. Americans buy Western Canadian livestock, B.C. timber and almost every drop of Alberta oil. Demand and prices for each have already been weakened by the pandemic.  Economic conditions in both the U.S. and Canada are deeply worrisome. The U.S. jobless rate in June was 11.1 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent just before the pandemic, and not far shy of the peak 11.9 per cent during the Great Recession of 2008-2010. The Canadian jobless rate peaked at about 14 per cent in the second quarter, Bill Morneau, the federal finance minister, said this week. It is expected to fall back to pre-pandemic levels of about seven per cent by the end of next year. The U.S. economy is forecast to shrink by about six per cent this year. Canada’s economy will shrink by 6.8 per cent, by the feds’ reckoning, before rebounding by about 5.5 per cent in 2021. But Ottawa’s projections for a robust economic recovery are pinned on a strong U.S. rebound. A Canadian export-driven economy tied to the U.S. market will, of course, fail to reach those recovery targets if the U.S. pandemic continues to drain America of economic vigour.  In contrast to the pandemic progress made by many major economies, the U.S. continues to report record numbers of new COVID-19 cases. Last month, Canada’s rolling seven-day average of daily new cases fell by 75 per cent. In the U.S., it rose by 37 per cent, reaching all-time highs of 50,000 or more new daily cases this week. As Paul Krugman, the Nobel-laureate economist, pointed out last week, Arizona, population seven million, has been reporting more new daily cases than the entire EU, population 446 million. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infection-disease expert, warned this week that, at the current rate of growth in new U.S. cases, America could be reporting upward of 100,000 new COVID-19 cases per day. The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that for every reported case of COVID-19, there probably are at least another 10 that have gone unreported. The U.S. already leads the world in reported COVID-19 cases and fatalities.  While many countries are preparing for an expected second wave of the virus, “We are still knee-deep in the first wave,” Fauci said. It is troubling for Canada’s economic prospects that the Trump administration is in denial about America’s failed response to the pandemic. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said this week that “The world is looking at us as a leader in COVID-19.” Trump himself said this week that COVID-19 will “sort of just disappear.” That isn’t the view in California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, where COVID-19 appears to be raging out of control and hospitals are close to overcapacity with COVID-19 cases. As to world opinion, a recent survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations found that just two per cent of European respondents believe the U.S. has been “helpful” in the fight against COVID-19. Given the resourcefulness of Americans, one has to believe conditions will improve, just as especially hard-hit jurisdictions including South Korea, Germany and New York City were able to stop the spread. But for now, Canada needs to brace for potential disruptions in U.S. supply chains. For example, Canadian grocers should be looking now for alternatives to California and Florida in citrus supplies. These are largely harvested in those U.S. states by migrant labour more vulnerable to COVID-19 than the general population. Otherwise, Canadians might be hit this winter with higher prices for oranges and other citrus products, and the economy will suffer a rise in food-related inflation.  We also need to brace for a new round of Trump protectionism. With his re-election prospects gloomy, Trump has returned to launching trade disputes. Their purpose is to deflect attention from the pandemic and to show concern about a faltering economy. That too is a worry for Canada. Coming into 2020, there was some hope among Canadian lumber producers and the U.S. homebuilders they supply that America’s long-standing punitive tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber might finally be lifted. Instead, the pandemic and Trump’s renewed protectionism have turned softwood lumber talks into dead letter. And the White House is musing about a renewed tariff assault on Canadian aluminum imports.  Canada is hardly the only target of Trump’s resurgent protectionism. His latest “America First” trade sanctions are also aimed at the EU as a whole, EU member Germany in particular, and Vietnam and other U.S. allies. All that against the backdrop of Trump’s trade war with China. Even before the pandemic, U.S. trade disputes, since ramped up, were depressing global GDP growth. “If the U.S. cannot get a handle on the virus, and if its leadership chooses a protectionist route to economic recovery, Canada’s return to normalcy will be that much harder,” Philippe Lagassé and Srdjan Vucetic, international affairs professors at Carleton University and the University of Ottawa, respectively, wrote recently. If only a get-well card to America signed by Canadians would make a difference. Be well. Remember that a new City of Toronto bylaw requires the use of masks in enclosed public spaces."

The region was the only office market in Canada to see a decrease in vacancy in the second quarter, according to a new report from commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE. Nationwide, the office vacancy rate rose from 10.3 to 10.8 per cent. Nearby London saw its rate climb from 14.7 to 15.7 per cent. The local results may not be indicative of what’s to come in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, if more companies decide to give up or reduce office footprints in a shift to permanent work-from-home or a hybrid model. But the statistics show the office market is still healthy for now, said Ted Overbaugh, CBRE’s Southwestern Ontario managing director. “We had a good quarter and I think that’s positive, and I kind of worry it’s not telling the whole story.” It can take months to plan a large office move, so it’s difficult to directly link rising vacancy rates in other markets to a pandemic that only began significantly impacting Canadian workplaces in early to mid-March. “We’re really only three months into this,” Overbaugh said. “It’s tough to say if those deals were already inked.” The percentage of vacant space that is sublet is trending upwards across the country, including in Waterloo Region, and that may hint at future moves, Overbaugh said. “It is a bit of a sign of companies rethinking their operations and their size and needs.” But as some companies shed space, others may find they need more in order to accommodate permanent physical distancing measures. “I don’t think the office market is dead, by any means,” he said. Most of Waterloo Region’s available sublet space is in the suburbs, the report found, and represents only 5.8 per cent of all vacant office space, the third lowest in Canada. The completion of projects including the new office building at 345 King St. W. in Kitchener will add office space to the core; CBRE said that building, which will be anchored by law firm Gowling WLG, is 40 per cent pre-leased. Overbaugh said the industrial sector remains active overall, despite a bit of a pause in the second quarter; he believes it will be the strongest performer this year. “There’s still good value to be had,” he said. “K-W is very stable. The values haven’t completely shot up like neighbouring markets.”  CBRE said more food and beverage firms are looking for industrial space in midwestern Ontario, while logistics and warehousing needs for the surging e-commerce segment continue to rise. “E-commerce was already trending, and retail was on the down slope,” Overbaugh said. “We’ve probably sped that up three to five years.”"

The number of homes sold through the Kitchener-Waterloo Association of Realtors in May spiked 80 per cent over April, with 419 residential properties changing hands last month. April’s sales were the lowest the association had seen in a single month since December 2008, as pandemic fears caused many buyers and sellers to put their plans on hold. “Consumer confidence, I think, is coming back,” said association president Colleen Koehler. With the market virtually paused for the second half of March and April, “we honestly didn’t know” what May would bring, she said. “I think it’s a little more significant than we anticipated.” There’s still quite a hill to climb to return to pre-pandemic sales levels; May’s sales represented a 40.5 per cent drop compared to results in May 2019. Average prices continue to rise year-over year. The average for all properties rose 6.5 per cent to $568,275, while the average for a detached home rose 5.4 per cent to $657,274. Those averages were virtually unchanged compared to April. The May median price for all properties rose 10.1 per cent over May 2019 to $545,000, while the median price of a detached home increased 9.6 per cent to $630,000. Apartment-style condos saw the lowest price growth; the May average sale price of $330,336 was up just 0.6 per cent compared to May 2019 results. Townhomes saw the average price rise 13 per cent to $454,197, while semi-detached homes were up 11.4 per cent to $482,479. A recent Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) report forecasts a tough road ahead for Canadian real estate, with predictions that housing prices nationwide could fall 9 to 18 per cent from first-quarter levels this year before starting to recover next year. In Ontario, CMHC predicts that decline won’t reverse until the third quarter next year; it could be the latter part of 2022, or later, before prices return to pre-pandemic averages. “The precise timing and speed of the recovery is highly uncertain because the virus’s future path is not yet known,” CMHC’s chief economist, Bob Dugan, said in a release. Koehler doesn’t believe the worst-case pricing scenarios will play out in Waterloo Region. “Time will tell. Obviously, what happens in the next six months will be crucial,” she said. “We still have a fairly strong economy here.” Historically-low inventory levels are helping to maintain higher prices, with homes in lower price categories still attracting multiple offers, Koehler said. While the association saw more new listings come on to the market last month than in April, with 577 residential properties put up for sale, it’s still a far cry from the previous 10-year average of 1,035 new listings in May, and represents a nearly 50 per cent drop over new listings in May 2019. Although traditional open houses are still prohibited in Ontario, virtual open houses and tours are proving popular, and the Ontario Real Estate Association has issued extensive health and safety guidelines when in-person showings and meetings are necessary. “We’re seeing more sellers feeling more comfortable about listing their properties now,” Koehler said."

The retail and office sectors could see the biggest changes as Waterloo Region emerges from pandemic lockdowns. In the past few weeks, several area businesses, ranging from bars and restaurants to tech firm Plasticity Labs, have already announced they won’t ever reopen. This week, Shopify — with hundreds of locally based employees and a large footprint at two Waterloo offices — said it will prioritize a work-from-home model going forward that throws its long-term need for substantial square footage into question. Shopify will maintain “recruitment hubs” in cities including Waterloo, the company said, but it’s not clear how much of its more than 100,000 square feet in Waterloo that will require. “Office space demand is a widely contested debate and consensus sees the future of office as having a mix of both options for staff to either work from home (WFH), from a dedicated office space, or combination of both,” Mitchell Blaine, of commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE, wrote in an email. “Both WFH and dedicated office spaces have their pros and cons and decisions by tenants over the next many months will be highly dependent upon the companies’ culture, financial health and future growth prospects.” Before March, the absorption rate of office space had been increasing, Ginger Whitney of Whitney & Company Realty said Thursday during an online discussion hosted by Communitech. Since then, the absorption rate has been in a holding pattern. “We don’t have the same velocity we once had,” Whitney said. “We are keen to see a correction happen, and to see what’s next with office space.” Blaine said he’s found that office leasing — and renewals in particular — has been continuing, while most sales have been extended or paused. “Large office expansions have been put on pause for the most part as many office tenants work to determine their optimum balance of WFH and dedicated office space needs,” he added. Spacing considerations might actually increase square footage needs if companies retain physical offices, Whitney and colleague Steph Snyder both noted in the online forum. New standards will probably eliminate bench-style seating, dividers and barriers may be required, HVAC systems might be outfitted with filters, and offices might be subject to random inspections, Whitney predicted. The retail market was already experiencing challenges pre-pandemic with the rise of online shopping, and those are now being heightened, Blaine said. Aside from grocery stores and pharmacies, retail properties “are the hardest hit and will likely be last to recover,” he said. Industrial/warehouse and apartment properties remain a bright spot, with strong momentum continuing, Blaine noted. Demand — and related investment — for logistics and e-commerce warehousing is on the rise. Commercial tenants may find opportunities as landlords work to avoid or fill vacancies, Snyder said. A sublease could provide short-term, flexible space at a good price, for example. Other firms may look to lower costs by sharing offices where staff from different companies come in on a rotation, and the space is intensively cleaned in between, said Whitney. “No landlord wants vacancies right now,” Snyder said. “There’s just so much uncertainty as to when those vacancies are going to fill.”"
