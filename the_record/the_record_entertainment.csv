The symphony announced Tuesday during an online news conference it will stream live concerts to paying audiences in September — Mozart’s Jupiter Symphony, and others by Beethoven and Mendelssohn. The musicians will be onstage at Centre in the Square, with two metres between all the players. “Some people don’t think we are essential, but we are more essential than anyone thinks,” said symphony music director Andrei Feher, “because everybody realizes artists are important these days, and how much they help.” The exact dates, programs and ticket prices for the live streams will be made public later this summer. The coming season will also include special guest artists such as Canadian singer-songwriter Royal Wood and singer Michael Vanhevel. Nobody knows how the COVID-19 pandemic will play out, but the symphony did not want to simply wait for a vaccine. “We are trying as much as possible to get back and making music together, offer something new, offer something different,” said Feher. Feher’s first child, a boy named Mihai, was born March 10. The next day the symphony announced it was cancelling the rest of the 2019-20 season. While the economy slowly reopens in stages, concert halls will likely have to wait until there is a vaccine before audiences can pack the seats. But nobody knows for sure. Andrew Bennet, the symphony’s executive director, said governments have provided between $600,000 and $700,000 in emergency funds during the first stages of the pandemic, and a similar amount will be needed to see the symphony through the 2020-21 season. Bennett said donors large and small have given much more than usual to the organization, but specifics will not be known until the organization’s fiscal year ends later this summer. The remaining parts of the 2020-21 season will be announced in blocks, he said, because of the uncertainty caused by the pandemic. “It allows us then to keep changing what we are doing on a month-to-month basis going through the season,” said Bennett. “We will start off in one mode, and be ready to go into the next mode whenever it proves possible.” If there is a second wave of COVID-19, the entire country, or parts of it, could be locked down again. If a vaccine is available early next year, the symphony could return to live concerts with audiences inside Centre in the Square.  The original program for the 2020-21 season will be delayed for 12 months and be presented in 2021-22. That allows the symphony to meet its commitment to subscribers. Tickets already purchased for the coming season will be automatically transferred to 2021-22, said Bennett. In October, the symphony will organize a party online to celebrate its 75th anniversary. “I am looking forward to a great online party,” said Bennett. “I am looking forward to having some guests from all over the world who can possibly join us who wouldn’t be able to do so otherwise.” Heather Galt, chair of the symphony’s board, said the encore performances the symphony has streamed online every Friday evening for the past few months have attracted huge audiences. “We have been incredibly pleased,” said Galt. “We have been able to reach audience sizes that we could never have imagined before the pandemic.” Those audience numbers demonstrate the symphony brings joy and much needed breaks from the unprecedented international crisis that has impacted everyone’s life, she said. “We are absolutely committed as a board and an organization to continue doing that even during this time,” said Galt. “That sense of joy and that sense of rest, we really need now more than ever,” said Galt, adding the board is committed to surviving the short term and being around for another 75 years and beyond."

It was during a lecture by a visiting professor at a scientific conference in Tehran, and as soon as she saw the beautiful image of the waterfalls she wanted to go there. The visiting professor at the conference was from the University of Waterloo, and in 2010 Zar came here to do her PhD in chemistry. “It’s funny, sometimes these little things change the path of your life,” says Zar, who still lives in Waterloo. She grew up surrounded by beauty in the ancient city of Qazvin. It is about two hours drive from Tehran and the centre of the ancient Persian art form of calligraphy. Close to her family home in Qazvin is a statue of Mir Ahmad, the man credited with founding the Persian form of calligraphy. Her family home was filled with old beautiful furniture because her father bought and sold antiques, and filled his house with some of the best ones he found. “From early childhood I was exposed to beautiful architecture and sculptures, all these things have elements of calligraphy,” Zar says. “Calligraphy is known as the number-one art in my city,” she adds. “A lot of my fellow artists knew how to write beautifully as a calligrapher.” The art form is part of the school curriculum in Iran, and that was Zar’s first exposure to calligraphy in 2004. By the time she saw that photo of Niagara Falls, Zar had completed her undergrad and Master’s in chemistry. After she came to the University of Waterloo in 2010, Zar continued to practice and experiment with different brushes, inks, pens and surfaces. Zar is passionate about Persian poetry. In her calligraphy she reproduces lines from famous poets, and from the Holy Qur’an. She did a placement at the Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery, helping with public programs. It was a great way to learn about Canadian, contemporary and Indigenous art. “I used this as a tool to both educate and introduce this traditional art to the community,” says Zar. She calls her calligraphy a bridge between the culture of her homeland, and her life in Canada. “I receive and I give, which makes it very rewarding to me,” says Zar. After finishing her PhD in 2015, Zar founded a business — Ati Zar artisan — to bring together Iranian artists living in this region. They gathered to both work and socialize. That’s how she first learned about the Coalition of Muslim Women of KW, and Zar started showing some of her calligraphy at festival’s organized by the coalition. “And then I noticed that even those with no background in Islam are interested, and little by little, I gained confidence,” says Zar. “I learned how I can communicate through this art with the larger community.” Along with TheMuseum, Zar is the co-organizer of this fall’s exhibition called “Harmony and Beauty in Islamic Art.” It is the fourth time TheMuseum and the Coalition of Muslim Women have collaborated on an exhibition. Works of art in all mediums — paintings, calligraphy, photography, ceramics, quilting, metal, woodwork and collage — are welcome. Interested artists should submit their work for consideration by Wednesday, July 15 to the Coalition of Muslim Women. For two years, Zar says she focused solely on her art. After realizing that even established artists struggle to pay their bills, she went to work with a med-tech startup that was founded nearly a year ago. It is using artificial intelligence sensors to develop a hand-held scanner to detect the location of blocked or burst arteries in a stroke victim’s brain. Her calligraphy keeps her rooted in her homeland and builds links to the wider community in this region. She did not plan to stay in Canada, but fell in love with a man here, married and built many connections through her art. A strong sense of belonging and community are among the most important reasons why Zar decided to stay in Canada and make her life here. “And I find Canada as my second home after I become a citizen, after I know more about Canadian culture, Canadian art,” says Zar. She sees herself as part of a multicultural community. “And I can identify myself, acknowledge my background as a Persian Muslim girl who is doing art and science and can have everything at the same time,” says Zar. “Being a Canadian and an Iranian, a scientist and an artist, it gives me a good feeling,” says Zar. “Not losing my ethnicity, not losing my religion, and being accepted for who I am.”"

Hjin is 19 and called his album “Before We are 20.” Available on several streaming services, it includes 10 original songs, and one cover of a Leonard Cohen tune. Hjin plays guitar and sings throughout the album. It is the second recording for Hjin, who has also released an EP with four jazz standards recorded live during one of his trio’s performances at The Jazz Room in Waterloo.  As soft-spoken as he is talented, Hjin was born in South Korea. His parents are professional musicians. His father, Mike, plays guitar. His mother, Sunny, plays piano. They worked as studio musicians, arrangers and producers.  The family moved to Kitchener in 2009, and Hjin started playing guitar not long afterwards. He learned his favourite songs by Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Eric Clapton. “It was just a lot of blues and rock,” said Hjin. Impressed with his progress, his parents urged him to start exploring jazz. So Hjin started listening to and emulating guitarists Pat Metheny and Wes Montgomery, and the lightning-fast saxophone solos of bebop innovator Charlie Parker. “That was probably around Grade 7,” said Hjin. When he started high school, Hjin attended Cameron Heights Collegiate. It has a diverse student population, and lots of resources, including a music program. Hjin loved it.  Every Saturday he was going to Toronto to attend the Humber College community school as well. On those days Hjin’s teacher was one of the leading jazz guitarists in the country — Lorne Lofsky.  Inquisitive, hard working, with a great attitude and up for anything, is how Lofsky describes the young guitar player. “He has something called ‘perfect pitch,’” said Lofsky. “Anything he hears he can recognize it, and emulate it right away.” Calling him extremely talented, Lofsky said Hjin soaked up all the lessons. “I had a great time teaching him,” said Lofsky. “We did a lot of playing and talking, mainly playing.” The group KW Big Band Theory was playing in Hjin’s high school and working with some of the students there. Tim Moher plays tenor and soprano sax with the band, and he remembers hearing Hjin play guitar when he was in Grade 9. “By Grade 10 or so I said: ‘Dave, we have to play together.’ And I hired him for street gigs up in Waterloo,” said Moher. Moher calls Hjin “a musical genius.” For inventiveness and sensitivity, he’s never heard anyone like him. Moher’s latest CD is a fusion of jazz, classical and Celtic music called “The Clefs of Moher.” Hjin plays on every track. Moher remembers one recording session when Hjin picked up a baritone guitar for the first time and played it for a few minutes. He used it to record the next track. “He just laid it down, he liked the sound,” said Moher. When Hjin was in Grade 11 he was playing guitar for KW Big Band Theory. The 17-piece ensemble plays a mix of jazz standards and new material. For a long time, the band leader was Robin Habermehl. “Incredible,” said Habermehl. “Nice kid, unbelievable musician. He has perfect pitch and a photographic memory.” Habermehl remembers leading the band through a rehearsal. Something wasn’t right. He stopped the musicians and studied the score in front of him. He asked Hjin to come up and look at the music and see if he could spot what was wrong. “Right from his chair he said: ‘The second trumpet should have a flat nine on that chord,’ and he’s looking at this guitar chart,” said Habermehl.  “Dave had already figured it out by listening to it, then he would play the chord on his guitar and said: ‘He needs to be playing a D flat,’” said Habermehl. Moher remembers the first time Hjin played with Big Band Theory, and the reaction of the band members when they heard Hjin’s first solo. “Everyone looked over, jaws on the floor,” said Moher. “Gifted, very gifted.” Hjin practices incessantly. On the way into the Humber College community school on Saturday mornings he sat in the back of a van and played his guitar. On the way home, same thing. At home, he practices for up to six hours a day. “And the nicest kid, no ego, no crap,” said Habermehl. “He was always respectful, never bragged, was very humble.” Habermehl calls Hjin one of the finest musicians he’s ever known. “Like scary good,” he said. When Hjin graduated from Cameron Heights his parents gave him a very special guitar — a 1971 Gibson ES-335. Hjin chipped in to help pay for it. He was accepted into the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but opted for the jazz program at Humber College. He is halfway through that program, and not yet out of his teens. Hjin is still developing as a musician. And those who know his playing can not help but wonder what the future will bring. “It’s really interesting,” said Moher. “He’s still a kid.” "

This is in Acapulco and the shooters are members of a powerful cartel with a vendetta against your journalist husband for reporting on their brutalities. And you own a bookstore and only recently found out that the leader of the cartel was one of your favourite customers.  How will you get away? That’s the opening chapter of “American Dirt,” a novel about Mexican migrants, published in January and chosen by Oprah for her Book Club. The author, Jeanine Cummins, received a seven-figure advance for it and it was blurbed glowingly by authors Stephen King, Ann Patchett, Sandra Cisneros and Julia Alvarez. Don Winslow calls it “a ‘Grapes of Wrath’ for our time.” I couldn’t put it down. Lydia Perez and her son, Luca, leave her now dead mother’s home where the police are barely investigating the shooting that took 16 of their relatives. (She suspects that the police are under the control of Javier, the cartel leader.)  Lydia and Luca spend the night in a hotel under a false name but in the morning a parcel arrives, a book of fiction from Javier with a love note. She and Luca manage to evade the black SUVs in the parking lot and board a series of buses to head for Mexico City. What follows is a desperate and fear-ridden journey to “el Norte.” If they can escape across the U.S.-Mexico border, she has an uncle in Denver whom she hopes will take them in.  First she tries to fly to Tijuana but airlines require her son’s birth certificate. So, like scores of other Mexicans, they walk countless miles and learn to ride atop freight trains. They join migrants from other Latin American countries, including two sisters from Honduras. Rebeca and Soledad are teens who followed their father from their village to the city, only to become sex slaves for a gangland pimp.  Lydia has gone from a comfortable middle-class life to a living hell. While she was aware that her husband’s work put their family in some danger (his newspaper would put them up in a hotel for a few days after each cartel story was published), she was regrettably naïve as to the depths of evil that Javier, whom she saw as a sophisticated bibliophile, was carrying out. And the plight of migrants was outside her comfortable life in Acapulco. Now she too will have her money stolen and witness the murders and accidental deaths of several fellow travellers.  But the way north is, like the Underground Railway, not without its angels — they survive with the help of the kindness of strangers. “There is always a smile, a blessing, a flare of recognition from the hardworking young man, who … imagines his own little sister or cousin or daughter in the place of these girls.” “American Dirt” is an adrenalin-fueled page-turner. This is the story of human beings escaping unbelievable violence in hopes of surviving in a country not controlled by brutal cartels.  But the book has been met with controversy, claiming that a white writer is too privileged to have empathy for her Latino and Mexican characters. The author spent four years researching the migrant experience and cites several migrant chronicles written by non-whites. She still felt unqualified to write this book but was advised by a Chicana academic: “We need as many voices as we can get, telling this story.”  For this reader, I am grateful that she did. In a better world, so would the President of the United States. We Canadians need to face our own racism and open our hearts to immigrants — all are human beings, like our own forbearers, in search of a better life. "
4,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/entertainment/art/2020/06/02/the-visual-artist-has-been-forgotten-during-the-pandemic.html,‘The visual artist has been forgotten’ during the pandemic,['Robert Williams'],"Wed., June 3, 2020","WATERLOO — The public display of art is a time-honoured tradition, a duality of nerves and excitement as the artist bares their soul to the larger community in hopes of inspiring wonder, conversation and change.  But in the time of COVID-19, when the need for escapism through art and beauty has never been greater, the art world has needed to get creative to stay relevant.  Art galleries across Waterloo Region were among the many businesses forced to close amid the pandemic. Other public institutions that host pop-up shows and art installations have also been forced to cancel or postpone. Instead, art has gone digital, with gallery catalogues and art shows moving to the online realm. “Soulfully, art is essential for one’s well-being,” said Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery executive director Shirley Madill. “It’s been shown throughout history, and I think we often miss that.” Consider Pablo Picasso’s “Guernica,” she said, painted in immediate reaction to the Nazis’ bombing practices on the Basque town of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. Or contemporary artist Ai Weiwei, whose work and activism has been in direct response to the Chinese government’s human rights record. “It’s not only escapism, it’s also where the answers are,” said Madill. “Artists, throughout time, have always addressed those issues. It’s why we’ve wanted to put more of an emphasis on engaging the public to show the critical effect art can have in difficult times. ” Shut in their homes, spending hours locked in studios, some artists have been given the gift of time to focus on their craft during COVID-19. And Madill is confident a new wave of pandemic-inspired work is on its way. But what has been lost in the meantime? “The visual artist has been forgotten,” said Mitzi Schnabel, a member of the Kitchener-Waterloo Society of Artists. “I understand how it has happened, I do. But as we move forward, I think it is a better place for everyone in the community when we have art.” For some artists, their livelihood has been at stake amid the standstill. For others, the opportunity to network and make new connections at exhibitions.  The society, which was forced to cancel several of its art shows since March, has transitioned to an online model as a way to continue showcasing the work of its 150 members. Everything from paintings to photographs to sculptures — the work has continued while the world has stood still.  “It’s been really interesting see what the artists have been up to over the last few months,” said Moumita Roychowdhury, one of the brains behind the online art show, and an artist in her own right. “It’s been disappointing because there haven’t been any public exhibitions for artists. But at the same time, we’re finding a new way of expressing ourselves.” The online platform is exposing the work to people from outside the region, but it’s not the only virtual platform artists are taking advantage of.  Art classes, in the absence of physical gatherings, are now being offered on Zoom and other video providers. Roychowdhury is running her classes from home, and developing a new cohort of students in the progress — some in the region, others beyond. “A lot of my students are now based outside of Kitchener-Waterloo, even outside Canada, and it’s really opened up some opportunities,” she said. “Now that there is no other way, people are starting to see that it’s a good opportunity.” Roychowdhury intends to continue offering the virtual classes after the pandemic, combining the distance learners with her local students. But there is something that’s lost on a computer screen when it comes to the visual arts — a physical presence that can’t be captured through a lens. And as the province continues with its phased reopening of the economy, spectators will soon be able to flock to the latest exhibition, in search of the answers of what this has all meant. “I’ve seen some of the work that’s being produced,” said Madill. “And you’re going to see some of that darkness, the ugliness that is out there. But you’re also going to see some artists produce a bright light, a beacon through this situation. ”"

This year is different. With lockdown wiping out a third of their 2020 operating hours, the pandemic nearly forced their permanent closure.  “We were done,” says Kristine Mathers, restaurant co-owner. “We had accepted it.” Their location at Sunset Villa, partially obscured by a stone wall, doesn’t attract foot traffic. With fixed monthly costs of four to five figures (exclusive of rent), after temporarily closing, they borrowed money (including receiving the federal Canadian Emergency Business Account loan) to keep afloat.  While the Sunset Villa Association waived three months’ rent, without knowing when or how they could reopen, the restaurant’s owners — Mathers, her brother, Jacob Beck, and his partner, Joanne Moyes — weighed their options. “We’re only two years old and had startup debt; we’re still just making minimum wage doing this,” says Mathers. “Being a small business, it’s all personal debt. We fully decided we were going to have to close.” In one form or another, there’s been a restaurant at Sunset Villa since the 1950s. The association’s board reached out and got a deep dive into the restaurant business before launching a two-week GoFundMe campaign. They raised more than $120,000 by June 1 and then, with the help of a local business owner, reached an agreement allowing the restaurant to reopen for the foreseeable future. “That was absolutely huge for us. We can’t operate out of guilt and passion and all of those wonderful things that drive things forward but then leave us in a ridiculous amount of debt.” Before the pandemic, Canada’s food service sector was expected to grow to $77.5 billion; revised outlooks now predict a precipitous drop, some saying to $38.4 billion (where it was in 2003). Razor-thin margins, sometimes bringing in only a few dollars per table, leave many Canadian restaurants struggling: 10 per cent closed within a couple of weeks of lockdown; currently, 60 per cent operate at a loss and 50 per cent risk permanent closure by summer’s end. There are layers to partially reopening under emergency orders. Without clear official guidelines, The Danish Place owners have turned to industry association Restaurants Canada for information. Additional expenses (disposables, sanitizing supplies, staff) need to be paid for while their 90-seat dining room is closed and patio is reduced to 20 seats. They’re requiring face coverings and physical distancing but returning to work, and increased exposure risk, means friends removed themselves from Mathers’ and her young daughter’s in-person circle.  The Danish Place’s website has detailed instructions on placing orders for pickup and making patio reservations. Right now, they’re open for a few hours on Saturdays and Sundays and they’ve edited their menu to smørrebrød (open-faced sandwiches); hot meals are in the works.  While perfect for a picnic, I grazed on the House Special Platter ($40), a lined cardboard flat that could easily feed four, over a few days. Slices of rye and French bread. Piles of savoury, rustic house-made leverpostej (pâté) with bacon and mushrooms; velvety, fatty rullepølse (cured pork belly) with aspic; tender, sliced frikadelle (meatball); waves of roast beef; gorgeously pongy esrom cheese, and, since I can’t have salmon, little bouncy poached shrimp.  Pots of butter, mayonnaise, vinegary herring, vibrant puce pickled cabbage, mustard-kicked remoulade, and crunchy pickles. Smear the bread, layer the topping and dot with pickle, sliced onions or bell peppers. I’m sure there are rules but when you’re under a tree or at your desk, build and eat your sandwich as you will. That week, they made Jordbærgrød, a lightly sweetened strawberry compote ($6). I ate it as recommended: cold, with a lashing of heavy cream. Summer in a bowl. Navigating the complexities of what used to be and what’s needed now is the hallmark of these Inbetween Times. Hopefully, we will find that sweet spot, because sweet spots like The Danish Place are hard to find.

Apart from my own sites, my byline appeared on well-known ones and now-defunct ones. I authored a white paper for a popular appliance manufacturer. Local and national media interviewed me a few times. I gave talks about food history and appeared on discussion panels on both sides of the border.  After my first Record review ran, a local acquaintance told me I shouldn’t write under my name and every picture of me should be removed from the internet. He didn’t think I should be recognized as the author of my work, although my white colleagues were credited for theirs. I politely ended my reply with, “I’m not easily erased.” He abruptly ended the exchange. I wasn’t surprised. I was born in Kitchener, grew up here, and got my degree from the University of Waterloo. Like other visible minorities, I’m well acquainted with the area’s casual and overt racism: Kids in school called me the N-word. Sales clerks follow me. Restaurant servers try to deny service. We see hate platformed, read gaslighting comments, and hear fauxpologies. Whenever someone demands to know where I’m “really” from, I’m reminded that to some, being Canadian is only skin deep.  That sense of who can and cannot be Canadian is woven into the national fabric. For Canada’s first 100 years, immigration policies prioritized those who could easily blend into colonial culture. Policies and regulations created an unofficial colour bar that throttled immigration from China and India. While not legislated, Wilfrid Laurier’s cabinet approved banning Black immigration. Japanese Canadians’ voting rights were withheld until 1949; Indigenous Peoples didn’t receive universal suffrage until 1982.  Shifting public attitudes of the 1960s led to Lester B. Pearson’s government overhauling our immigration system. Applicants earned points for things such as education, work skills, and language skills; race wasn’t supposed to be a factor. A few years later, in 1971, Pierre Trudeau adopted the Bilingualism and Biculturalism Commission’s recommendation to make multiculturalism national policy.  But reversing a century of systemic racism doesn’t happen overnight.  Black Lives Matter has laid bare deep-seated biases against Black people and other marginalized groups, with conversations turning to how these attitudes flow in the undercurrents of our daily lives: salaries and promotions, social media moderation, how we think about food. I know I’m a rare flower in that I’m a bylined, paid, freelance food writer, who happens to be of South Indian ancestry. This field is traditionally populated by white writers focused on urban, white, bourgeois diners. These writers often elevate certain cuisines to three-star haute status while they devalue immigrant cuisines to cheap eats, particularly when made by immigrant hands. They’ll blur regional foods into Chinese, Latino, and Indian abstractions, and coo over the curiosity of “ethnic” foods, when gentrified or appropriated by white personalities. Contemporary food writing isn’t entirely fogged by exhausted views. Independent voices and staff writers, like some now at The New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, and Food & Wine, don’t necessarily look like, think like, or eat like their predecessors and are more reflective of their communities and generations. While some continue the aspirational chase for “the best places,” others unearth compelling stories in tasty places. Condescending eyes aren’t cast on diasporic cuisines or their labour. Restaurants and chefs previously fawned over aren’t automatically slid easy praise.  Change is difficult, especially after decades of magazines, newspapers, radio, and TV reinforcing cultural biases. Some eaters are flummoxed with opinions, voices, or faces that don’t fit the old mould. Without reading my work, a woman told me I’m unqualified to write about “white people’s food” because I wasn’t raised on it. When I said that must also mean white people who weren’t raised eating Japanese, Chinese, Thai and other non-European cuisines weren’t qualified to write about them, she mumbled something and walked away.  I’ve been told restaurants in Waterloo’s University District — a young area, chockablock with diasporic cuisines often cooked by non-white hands — aren’t “worthy” of review. Patronizing comments like “who can eat this?” echo sentiments about stinky, spicy, unclean foreign foods. My foodways writing spotlights cuisines our neighbours bring with them, but some insist those aren’t “the most important” ones. As one person said, “we don’t eat like this.”  But we do.  More than 50 years after immigration reforms, Waterloo Region’s population includes more than 220 ethnicities and one in five of us identify as a visible minority. How we think of ourselves should evolve with our community. How we tell today’s stories — from business to arts to sports to culture to food — should reflect who we are now. Not who we were in the decades before I was born. Not who those in far-off glass towers think we are.  We may not have eaten like this in 1950, but we do eat like this in 2020. Because that’s who we really are."

They won 2019 Business of the Year awards from both the Greater K-W and Cambridge chambers of commerce, and were named the inaugural Caterer of the Year by Food Awards Ontario.  Anticipating 20 per cent revenue growth, founder and chief executive officer Stephanie Soulis was busy outfitting a 30-seat dining lounge adjacent to her new 7,000-square-foot state-of-the-art kitchen and looking forward to a long summer vacation to the east coast with her husband and three youngsters. Then, COVID. Soulis says she cried when she had to lay off 90 per cent of her staff, leaving just four people to try to keep things going. Suddenly, she was back in the kitchen, helping head chef Rachel Medeiros, delivering food, and managing orders till the wee hours, while still staying connected with the community. Soulis describes it as “being a startup again but with the overhead of a well-established company.” Their existing systems proved sufficiently robust to easily accommodate the shift from a focus on catering events and weddings, to prepared meal delivery. Though government assistance has allowed her to rehire three employees, that aid has barely kept them afloat, she says. Without a break on rent, and operating at about 10 per cent of projected revenues, she says she recently, reluctantly, discontinued providing free food and groceries to laid-off staff. Seemingly indefatigable, Soulis also chairs the Kitchener Library, serves on Waterloo Region Tourism Marketing Corporation’s board, and is assisting with a local mental health initiative for the hospitality industry.  Despite the evident strain, she’s kept true to her core values as a social entrepreneur, still finding ways to give back, including through a pay-it-forward boxed-lunch program that has seen $15,000 of meals donated to hospital and long-term-care facility staff. Little Mushroom was also just Pride-certified as a LGBTQ safe space. Soulis is also constantly seeking to partner with local businesses, particularly those run by women and/or minorities. That’s how a terrific sweet potato and tarragon dressing from MH Fine Foods in Cambridge found its way onto the fresh but otherwise undistinguished garden salad ($8) we enjoyed as part of our order. We had missed out on the Jiggs Dinner offered earlier in the week, and the Chicken and Smoked Mozzarella Flatbread were sold out, but there was still plenty of choice among the freshly prepared Thursday/Friday specials, from Mac N Cheese, Turkey Sliders with Guacamole and Jalapeno Havarti, to Chunky Caprese Salad.  To snack on, we selected Corn Chips — a small mountain — with in-house Guac, sour cream and a thick salsa ($10). Lamb Sliders ($18 for six) came with creamy aioli redolent of fresh rosemary: though unclear on the order form, buns were included. The miniburgers were quite tasty and quickly scarfed down.  When ordering we were unsure whether dishes came hot or not. All travelled well in a cooler and had clear reheating instructions where appropriate.  When ordering from an unfamiliar menu, estimating quantities can be tricky. Little Mushroom’s portions were generous, so we ended up eating our Asparagus and Brie Quiche ($16) — the custard light and the pastry crust nicely flaky — over the course of two subsequent meals. A couple from among the selection of dessert Bars and Squares ($6) remained to be taken with afternoon tea, instead of my customary crumpets and jam.  Once they get back to catering, Little Mushroom will continue offering some freezer meals. The dining lounge — with COVID-configured seating for up to 12 diners at six tables — will open as soon as the authorities allow. Jason Hanoski, formerly of Grand Trunk Saloon, will head that kitchen, while Conestoga College hospitality program grad, Dylan McLean, will be general manager.  All our Little Mushroom takeout was excellent value and palpably fresh: Whether to go, or eventually dine-in, their offerings represent a super option for anyone seeking a break from COVID kitchen duties.

8,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/life/food-wine/review/2020/06/25/dining-in-this-kitchen-has-kornered-the-breakfast-market-in-waterloo.html,Dining In: This Kitchen has Kornered the breakfast market in Waterloo,['Sandra Walneck'],"Thu., June 25, 2020","When I was a teenager my parents frowned upon sleeping in late and they employed subtle ways of showing their disapproval. My mother would vacuum my room as I lay there, apparently in her way. And my dad would hose off the exterior of my bedroom window as a supposed part of his weekend morning home maintenance routine. The sound of a water jet hitting glass is quite startling, if you were wondering. We have taken a more relaxed approach to parenting around here, although I had a very difficult time not jumping up and down on my daughter’s bed the Saturday morning that we planned to order in brunch from the Korner Kitchen. It was all part of some special mother/daughter time I had been scheduling to try to add a little cheer to the week that should have included her prom.  The two of us had eaten at their appealing new restaurant in Waterloo on what became her last day of high school, and nearly the restaurant’s last day being open for regular business. It felt like coming full circle when I called to put in our order and discovered they were hoping to soon reopen their patio for diners. We are big fans of breakfast in this family and Korner Kitchen has just the menu for us. They also have plenty of lunch items, along with daily specials. I dithered a bit over the menu because I couldn’t decide between sweet and savoury. A day without maple syrup is like a day without sunshine, but I ended up with the best of both worlds when my daughter and I added a Belgian waffle ($8.29) to share as a side. We definitely ordered more than we could eat, but I knew we would enjoy the leftovers. I was very happy with my choice of the Canadian Eggs Benedict ($13.50). It derives its name from the inclusion of pea meal, or Canadian bacon, which is layered with poached egg and melted cheddar cheese, all on top of a toasted English muffin and smothered with delicious Hollandaise sauce. It was tasty and satisfying, and came with two side dishes. The hash brown potatoes at Korner Kitchen are a thing of beauty. The potatoes are grated nice and thin, salted and cooked to crispy perfection. I also had the fruit salad, which was quite large and incorporated two types of melon, three types of berries, bananas, kiwi fruit, pineapple, and grapes. My daughter’s BLT Deluxe Sandwich ($10.50) was so generously sized that the sides of hash brown potatoes and baked beans had to go into a separate container. The sandwich was made with bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, smashed avocado, two fried eggs and garlic mayo, all between toasted whole-wheat bread. She also really enjoyed the hash browns and smaller portion of baked beans. The waffle we shared was light, airy and accompanied by a whipped topping. I added my own maple syrup, of course. The final dish we sampled was the Berry Salad ($16.95). I was looking to add a little fresh greens to our meal and it didn’t disappoint. This salad is a satisfying meal in itself — and came with a grilled breast of chicken on the side. There are plenty of toppings including berries, toasted sliced almonds, pieces of walnut, crumbled goat cheese and I chose a balsamic vinaigrette for my dressing.  Last but not least, we each ordered a Tropical White Herbal Tea ($3.25). I would describe it as having the aroma and flavour of a delicious island-themed cocktail, but in tea form. The other three members of my family are not going to read this review with quite the same enthusiasm as my daughter and I felt eating our brunch, but they can rest assured we will be ordering in again soon from Korner Kitchen. Korner Kitchen 183 Weber St. N., Waterloo 519-578-8555 www.kornerkitchen.ca Hours: Open daily 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Menu: Breakfast, lunch and beverage menus featuring freshly prepared, generously sized traditional breakfast and lunch items, as well as Korner Kitchen specialties.

Pizza? Wings? Battered deep-fried pork balls with gloopy dayglo red sauce? According to Uber Eats, butter chicken topped national doorstep drop-offs during our housebound heyday. While poutine came in second, more naan than fries zipped down our streets and more shawarma than onion rings. The rest of the list — miso soup, pad Thai, bubble tea and edamame — tells a story of how we’re eating now: More than half of us born after the mid-1960s were already used to scrolling and clicking to fill our bellies before March. Also, surveys reveal the younger we are, the more likely we’ll fill our plates with foods our parents and grandparents won’t eat. It seems as our understandings and experiences broaden, so do our palates. A friend and I have a decade-long on-again-off-again conversation about Indian restaurants. I grew up eating the best South Indian food in Waterloo Region — note: my mum’s cooking is the best. That’s not up for debate — while my friend is giddily incandescent about a place that’s … lacking. A few months ago, she shoved a takeout menu for Sahar’s Kitchen into my hand and implored, “This place is so much better. You have to try it. You have to.” It was like she switched from Android to iPhone, Coke to Pepsi, the Leafs to, well, anyone.  Sahar’s Kitchen’s familiar collection of foods hopscotches across the Indian subcontinent. Along with those rooted in Bengali, Chettiar, Goan, Mughlai and Pakistani traditions, others are from the Anglo-Indian canon. With a family story that stretches from Pakistan to Bangladesh to Hong Kong, Majid Maqbool joined his wife, Jhorna, in Kitchener in 2015. Before this, he was cooking at a family restaurant in Hong Kong.  The plan was always to return to the restaurateur life here. Two years ago they opened, naming their restaurant after their now four-year-old daughter — Sahar means dawn’s light. Here, the couple, along with Mian Maqbool Sabry (Majid’s father), turn out some fine dishes from the cosy restaurant’s kitchen.  Unlidding containers reveals complex aromas and flavours buoyed by texture and colour. Rivulets of brick red oils swirl atop luscious crimson and russet gravies. Spices speckle pallid sweet sauces. Textures wander from firm to sticky to voluptuously soft. The Butter Chicken’s ($15.99) chunks of breast meat are tender and swathed in a rounded, rich, tomato gravy. Unlike the tinned tomato soupiness that’s sometimes found elsewhere, its light sweetness doesn’t overpower. The King Prawn Chettinad ($17.99) is punchy with a pleasantly creeping heat that doesn’t overpower. The gravy’s depth is boosted from the firm tail-on shrimp — here, the gravy is to be sopped up.  For okra fans, the Bhindi Bhaji ($14.99) combines firm and slippery chunks with slithers of silky onion, fried in mild spices. There’s a mild tang to the Bharta’s ($14.99) soft mash of grilled eggplant from the tomato masala.  Mixing the wet and dry dishes into the nutty, aromatic Basmati ($3.99), jeera rice flecked with grains of saffron rice, brings everything together. The soft, bubbly Garlic Naan ($3.99) — blistered from the tandoor and scattered with chopped garlic and coriander — is perfect for sopping up puddles of gravy. Soaked in sweetened rosewater-scented cream, the Rasmalai’s ($2.99) cheesecake-like paneer is moreish. And whether you call it kheer, payasam or Rice Pudding ($2.99), the loose, butter yellow pudding is flavoured with cardamom and studded with cashews. Both are needed desserts for hot nights. There was a well-spaced queue of customers and delivery drivers spilling onto the sidewalk when I picked up dinner. Business has been steady throughout COVID-19 and I can see why. The Maqbools turn out tasty, fresh-made foods in Kitchener to satisfy faraway cravings.

10,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/life/food-wine/review/2020/06/11/dining-in-gayuma-catering-serves-asian-fusion-from-the-heart.html,Dining In: Gayuma Catering serves Asian fusion from the heart,['Alex Bielak'],"Thu., June 11, 2020","Given the positive online buzz about Gayuma Catering’s takeout Asian fusion dishes, and how fast they sold out, I was delighted when I finally successfully placed an order. Everything about the place seemed happy, from the jaunty logo, incorporating chopsticks and noodles into the letter G, to the upbeat social media posts, often featuring the radiant owners.  Katrina Tioco came from the Philippines in 2006 as a caregiver, and still has family there she supports financially. She eventually worked as a nanny for Canadian-born Jinny Song, whose ancestry is South Korean. That’s how Song came to appreciate just how good a cook Tioco is.  Two years ago, Song convinced Tioco to do some food pop-ups at the bubble tea shop she manages. She was certain people would love her now-friend’s cooking, saying “I really wanted to get her food out there. She never believed in herself, but I did. She’s the sister I never had.”  Not long thereafter, they started Gayuma, originally catering to tech sector companies. With corporate offices closed because of COVID-19, they lost all their clients. “We still had family to support and rent to pay, so we changed our business model very quickly, beginning with a Facebook post. It was slow in the beginning: the first week we had just 10 orders, but it grew each week and we are now at capacity every weekend. We are so grateful. In a way, it was a blessing in disguise.”  Tioco says her grandfather served as the inspiration for the name Gayuma. During the ’60s, impatient customers lined up at his restaurant, pressing him to tell them what made his food so special and worth the wait. He told them he cooked everything from scratch, with all his heart, and that was why they were there. The Filipino word Gayuma, “that which attracts,” encapsulated his offerings.  She says that is the way she cooks now. “I can’t speed it up, and people are so patient with me. I decide what to cook once I’m at the grocery store. And I’ve had to accommodate all sorts of allergies, so have had to find alternative ingredients that can work in the dishes to substitute for things like peanuts. Guided by her grandmother during Facebook chats, she’s found various Asian herbs and seeds that can serve as replacements, while keeping the dishes tasting right.”  Dodging summer downpours, I picked up my order at the back of a small strip mall off Weber Street. A small sign by a nondescript door directed me to call to get my order. Once the door opened, there, above the masks, were those same smiling eyes I had seen on Facebook. I was the last client of the day, so the ladies had time to chat before closing.  Tioco’s actual sister — another radiant smile beaming from the back of the store — was responsible for folding each of the 20 dumplings that comprised part of our order. Half beef, half pork, with garlic, shallots, salt and pepper, they were delicious in Tioco’s signature, a beautifully clear and garlicky, 48-hour chicken soup. The accompanying ginger soy sauce also provided contrasting flavour.  Song told me that Chap Chae is a sweet potato glass noodle Korean dish, more savoury than spicy. She said Tioco makes it better than she can, adding the highest of praise, “it’s like my mother’s.” The ground beef was marinated overnight with sesame oil, soya sauce, brown sugar, crushed garlic and pepper, before being sautéed with green onion and added to the noodles. A small container of brought-in Sriracha allowed for a bit of heat for those so inclined. I could frankly have done with the protein being a bit more prominent among the other ingredients — peppers, carrot, shiitake mushrooms, spinach and sesame seeds — but that is the merest of quibbles.  The copious and truly satisfying meal — consciously made affordable by Tioco and Song to give back to the community during COVID — was most enjoyable. Everyone was keen to order again, and I’ll certainly be watching out for what is on offer each week, and for what the future holds for these joyful entrepreneurs.

Weeding is a lonely pursuit but back in the day I did have young assistants, whether willing or not. The middle child once said we were fighting Sir Weedy and his evil henchmen.  My husband noted that this year I am showing extra aggression in my assault on Sir Weedy. His point is valid, but I would describe my methods as therapeutic. It’s a healthy outlet for stress. For your safety, however, do not approach during one of my sessions. One works up quite a thirst and appetite after all that hard work, especially on a Friday night. Some of us were craving chicken wings and we knew just the right spot.  Morty’s Pub in Waterloo is conveniently located near our two universities but its popularity extends well beyond the student population. For nearly 40 years the casual eatery has been a local favourite for its house specialty wings, frosty beverages, and friendly, welcoming atmosphere. They’ve cleverly embraced the new rules regarding alcohol and include beer and wings specials, along with a whole array of tempting takeout options, from their menu. Unlike prior Friday night escapades, which involved debate and discussion over what to order, the four of us made our choices lickety split. Morty’s online ordering system is very straightforward and sets out payment and pickup methods designed to be contact-free. If alcohol is part of the order, proof of age must be provided at the time of pickup. Alcohol can’t be included if you opt to have your order delivered.  Friday nights at Morty’s are especially festive, as my husband and eldest son discovered when they arrived in the parking lot to pick up our food. Their server was decked out in a grass skirt and flowery lei in honour of the occasion. There’s a different theme every week, so prepare to be surprised. Everything in our order was neatly packaged and labelled for ease of distribution. The starters we ordered to share were apparently irresistible. By the time I had finished taking the photos to go with this review, the others had graciously left me one of the Pickle Spears ($11.99) to try, which left me wanting more. Fried pickles are pretty straightforward but when they’re done right they’re really tasty. These were crisp spears of dill pickle coated in just the right amount of breading and paired with a garlicky sauce. I fared better with the Spinach Dip ($13.49) and toasted pita triangles for dipping. There was plenty of the creamy spinach, artichoke, Asiago and feta cheese mixture for all to enjoy. It is meant to be served hot, so it can be popped in the microwave if needed.  My son and husband each ordered medium-sized Famous Chicken Wings ($24.99, includes one or two sauces). Both opted for the smoked unbreaded style, but one went with Cajun sauce and the other with Hot. The wings were very enjoyable and the level of heat was to their taste. We also shared a tasty Basket O’Fries ($6.99), which contained more than enough for everyone.  My daughter chose the Chicken Chunks ($13.49) in Honey Garlic. It was a generous portion and there was enough left over to share for lunch the next day.  I also had leftovers from my Morty’s Steak Sandwich ($15.99) but I carefully hid them in the fridge. That sandwich was delicious with layers of flank steak, mozzarella cheese, sautéed onion, mushrooms and green pepper. Some beef sandwiches cry out for a gravy or dip but this one stood up on its own. Morty’s has everything you need to celebrate the start of summer from the comfort and safety of your own patio. Morty’s Pub 272 King St. N., Waterloo 519-886-0440 www.mortys.com Hours: Wednesdays to Sundays: noon to 9 p.m., accepting orders until 8:30 p.m. Menu: Morty’s offers a wide array of pub grub, including appetizers, wings, sandwiches, burgers, soft drinks, and wine, liquor and beer with an order of food. Dessert is ice cream from Four All, and they also have bottles of hot sauce for the adventurous. Payment: Credit card payment made at time of order. Cash payments will not be accepted. How to get your food: You can order directly from the restaurant on their website or by phone for curbside pickup, and for delivery through Skip The Dishes. The bill: $126.48 (including tax but not tip) for one Pickle Spears, one Artichoke Dip, one Chicken Chunks, two medium Famous Chicken Wings, one Basket O’ Fries and one Morty’s Steak Sandwich.

12,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/life/food-wine/2020/05/28/dining-in-tasty-italian-dishes-for-your-casa-from-casa-rugantino.html,"Dining In: Tasty Italian dishes for your casa, from Casa Rugantino",['Jasmine Mangalaseril'],"Thu., May 28, 2020","Summer thumped down on us, bringing hot temperatures, blazing sunshine and cerulean skies (and perhaps a few spots of rain). I’m sure some think this is Mother Nature brazenly taunting us into old habits: throwing backyard parties, unfurling picnic blankets in the park, staking out territory on the beach. But today, on March the sixty-thirteenth, those innocuous habits of The Beforetimes seem hedonistic. As we dip our toes into reopening the economy, we’ll continue to take the precautions we need to protect ourselves and others. Along with that, many of us will keep supporting those doing their best to keep things going in our community — front-line workers, shops and restaurants as they navigate still uncertain waters. About nine years ago, Shelly Trotta purchased Casa Rugantino, building on the Belmont Village restaurant’s reputation as a family-run spot serving good Italian food. Since temporarily closing the dining room, she refocussed the neighbourhood trattoria business to offer preordered pickup, mostly from their already established menu. Same-day orders must be called in by noon, with pickup times from 4 to 7 p.m. You can pay in advance with Visa or Mastercard or on-site with debit.  Their menu lists a good selection of favourites (as available) — pasta, pizza, seafood, baked and braised dishes. There’s good choice for those wanting vegetarian meals, with some pasta dishes — the lasagna and baked penne — offering meat and nonmeat versions. They’ve also got a dessert that changes weekly. If you want a bottle of wine, you can select one from their list. Their family takeout dinner (lasagna or baked penne and either Caesar or house salad, $80) feeds four to six. Our order is pretty much ready when I arrive, and comes with a clutch of small, soft rolls. The containers highlight two signature recipes, received from previous owners, that made Casa Rugantino a favourite for more than 40 years: the marinara and meat sauces balance sweet, savoury and sharp tomatoey flavours; the third staple recipe is their pizza dough. Good ingredients get turned into more than generous portions, all dusted with Parmesan.  The Arancini ($11.95), an ample starter of three with marinara sauce and a side of rocket, is a good dinner for small eaters. Each rice ball is a handful, dusted in seasoned fine bread crumb, pan-fried and baked. Granted, they steamed on the way home, but they’re still toothsome with savoury al dente rice, the accompanying bitter leaves and the just tangy-enough sauce. I licked the plate. You’d do the same. Yes, you would. The Lasagna (meat, $16.50) container suffered a bit on the ride home due to some hard braking. But sliding layers don’t diminish its taste or texture. Made fresh-to-order, the dappled cheese top blankets sheets of Vincenzo’s pasta, tender beef, and sauce. I reheated it a titch so its gooey, melty mozzarella web pulls with each forkful. It’s a good, comforting plate. The Eggplant Parmigiana ($25.95) is a hearty meal, particularly when you add a small Caesar Salad and a side of Baked Pasta. Torn, crisp romaine is lightly dressed in house-made Caesar dressing and topped with good, chunky croutons. The baked pasta is firm to the tooth and swathed in meat sauce (it can be made with plain marinara). The eggplant — peeled, thick slices that are sautéed, baked and tender to the tooth — is nicely sauced and covered with burnished and stretchy mozzarella. Since closing Casa Rugantino’s dining room, Trotta says the community has been overwhelming in support for their neighbourhood spot. At first, many came for pizza, but now they’re diving into the rest of the menu. And why not? It’s all delicious here. Reheats: Since Dining In began, a couple of local resources have been created listing local restaurants operating during the pandemic.

Up to 5,000 people a week are enjoying concerts streamed online every Friday at 8 p.m. on the symphony’s Facebook page and YouTube channel. Normally, the KWS Signature Series attracts about 1,000 people to a concert at Centre in the Square. Attendance can vary significantly for symphony concerts. Performances of iconic works, such as Beethoven’s Ninth Sympny or Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, will sell out and attract 2,000 to both the Friday and Saturday night concerts. So, 4,000 people over two nights is the capacity. With the move to online broadcasts of recorded concerts, the KWS is reaching more people than ever.  “We have pivoted,” said Andrew Bennett, the symphony’s executive director. That data shows the overwhelming majority of the online audiences stick around for the entire performance.  For the first two weeks the symphony streamed audio and video. Now, it is audio only. When a symphony concert is streaming on Facebook some of the musicians are chatting on the platform about the show, and interacting with audiences. After Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony was streamed, there was a gathering of musicians and fans on Zoom. “So you actually get to do things you normally wouldn’t get to do during a concert,” said Bennett. The symphony will continue to stream concerts at no charge during the pandemic shutdown. It helps the symphony stay in contact with its loyal base of fans, and reach new ones. People as far away as the U.K. have watched the concerts. “It’s great for the organization to have this exposure,” said Bennett. “It’s a fantastic opportunity for people to hear how good the orchestra is.”  The players, conductors, guest soloists, symphony management and the Candian Federation of Musicians had to agree to provide the material online for free. The demonstrated success of the streaming does not mean the KWS is going to take the next step when the pandemic is over, and allow audience members to record short videos of the orchestra on their smartphones during a performance and post that to social media.  The internet is one of the most powerful tools for promoting events and growing audiences, but the contract between the symphony and the musicians’ union forbids the sharing of digital content, even by an audience member using a smartphone. It is the same for every unionized orchestra across Canada, said Katherine Carleton, the executive director of Orchestras Canada. The union and some symphonies in the U.S. have agreed to allow audience members to take short videos on their phones, and post that content online, for some shows, she said. “There is a little bit more flexibility in the U.S. than there is in Canada,” said Bennett. “It is an interesting and ongoing conversation.” When content is captured on a smartphone, and shared on social media, the only ones making money on it are the digital platforms, not the musicians and not their symphonies, said Bennett. Orchestras Canada, which represents 130 orchestras, does not take a position on the issue. It is up to the musician’s federation and the orchestras to negotiate the collective agreements. Paul Mitchell, the head of the Central Ontario Musicians’ Association, said allowing audience members to record short segments of a concert on their smartphone and share that online would distract other audience members. “You are opening Pandora’s Box there,” said Mitchell. Under the terms of the union contract, only the musicians’ association can make recordings of the orchestra and it retains control of the recordings. No part of a concert can be recorded or reproduced and then transmitted from the concert hall by anyone without a specific written agreement with the Canadian Federation of Musicians, said Mitchell. And that definitely covers audience members who want to make short videos with their smartphones and post that online. The clause is there because the union believes symphony musicians should always be paid for the music they create, said Mitchell. “As soon as you let the general public do whatever they want, the bottom falls out of the market,” said Mitchell.  Short snippets of a symphony concert posted online could be grabbed by other parties and included in something that is making money, and the musicians would never see a dime, he said. “You miss out on the revenue stream for something you created,” said Mitchell. “Everybody should get paid again, and it’s not out of greed, it’s because they created it and somebody else is making money from it again.” So far the KWS has streamed six pre-recorded concerts. The musicians are also producing other digital content during the pandemic shutdown as well.  When the pandemic hit, the symphony management and board of directors decided not to lay off anyone. That decision, and the fact the KWS treats its musicians as employees, means they qualify for a 75 per cent wage subsidy from Ottawa. “We are the luckiest,” said Larry Larson, the KWS principal trumpet. About half of the members of Orchestra Canada treat their musicians as employees. The others treat musicians as independent contractors. The wage subsidy is an economic life line for the musicians. Larson lost his regular gig at the Stratford Festival where he plays the fanfare at the main theatre before the plays. He was also going to play in the orchestra for the festival’s production of “Spamalot.” All of that was lost with the pandemic shutdown. “It’s just a bizarre, bizarre time, for sure,” said Larson. He credits the KWS management and board for keeping everyone on the payroll. They made that decision even before Ottawa announced the wage subsidy program. When the summer comes, the KWS musicians will apply for Employment Insurance. “What do you do? You throw up your hands and you say: ‘There is nothing can be done except try to stay self-motivated as an artist, keep honing your skills through all of this, and know that some day performances will be back,” said Larson."
14,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/entertainment/music/2020/05/22/the-reklaws-using-pandemic-downtime-to-write-more-songs.html,The Reklaws using pandemic downtime to write more songs,['Terry Pender'],"Fri., May 22, 2020","WATERLOO REGION — Stuart and Jenna Walker — known to millions of fans as The Reklaws — are busy writing songs during the COVID-19 shutdown and expect to release new material this summer. “I never thought we would see anything like this, this is just crazy,” said Stuart of the pandemic that’s killed live music shows probably until a vaccine is available. The brother-and-sister country music sensation from Cambridge had planned to be in Nashville for the entire month of May for an intense round of songwriting with producers and lyricists. Now, they are doing that via Zoom from their homes in Toronto. “People are learning to get by with Zoom calls and the songs are just as good, so we are like: ‘OK, this is what we are doing for a while,’ but it seems to be working, so that’s good,” said Jenna. The Reklaws had a full calendar of shows booked for 2020 but then the pandemic hit and everything was shut down. The reopening of some retail stores, parks, marinas and golf courses in no way signals a return to live music. The magic of live shows absolutely requires a venue packed with fans. And that will not be allowed until a vaccine is available.  But The Reklaws are as upbeat about it as their music. They exploded onto the country music scene in 2017 with their song “Hometown Kids.” In less than three years fans streamed their songs more than 33 million times, they garnered a Juno nomination, released am EP and performed all over North America. “Things were moving so quickly we were kind of taking things for granted for a while,” said Jenna. The pause is unexpected, but also welcome. They spent the Victoria Day long weekend at their cottage near Sauble Beach. They have been going to that cottage for 20 years this summer. These days they live near one another in Toronto and get together for regular songwriting sessions. “It’s time we can use for songwriting, and just getting our things in order for when it starts up again because it is going to be wild when it does,” said Jenna. They each bring 10 to 20 ideas to a songwriting session, written on their smartphones or laptops. They pitch those ideas to hotshot lyricists and producers in Nashville during Zoom calls. “Titles and ideas, whatever,” said Jenna. “Exactly — it could be a word, it could be an entire chorus written out,” said Stuart. “If people are into it that’s great, if not then you take it with a grain of salt and carry on.” Their creative method is working music industry wonders. The 2018 single “Long Live the Night” went Gold and was streamed more than any other Canadian country song that year. The Canadian Football League used it as a theme song for weekly television broadcasts. “We go in with titles and we do like to write to tracks,” said Stuart. “So, if there is a producer or track guy in that day, we hope that he has a beat ready to go, and we try to write to that and see what the vibe is of everybody in the room.” Signed to Universal Music, their story is like something straight out of the movies. They went from their hometown of Cambridge to festivals and venues around the continent. Already successful, they are touted as the next country music superstars. “We are just going to try and stay in a creative space, keep on writing and stay positive in every way we can,” said Stuart.  No surprise there. Their music is not the sad twang of lonely hearts, cheating wives, lost farms and dead dogs. The Reklaws are joyous and celebratory. “I think we are lucky as artists. We have a fan base that is pretty strong. They know it’s not over. They know we are going to come back even bigger,” said Jenna. Human trials of three different vaccines are underway in Canada, England and the U.S. There is a prototype of one vaccine that has already protected lab monkeys from COVID-19. It will take a vaccine to save the live music business. “That means the world to us,” said Jenna. “We are going to get stuff in order in terms of songwriting. It’s funny, when we are running and we are playing shows we run out of time to get everything else together. And when we do go to song-write it kind of feels like we are flying by the seat-of-our pants and just trying to keep up.” Stuart believes the pandemic shutdown is a test of every single musician. And while he and Jenna like the interaction with individual fans that happens during online shows, there is nothing like a venue packed with loud, appreciative fans dancing to the music. “I think the place we thrive the most is live, onstage, before a crowd,” said Stuart. “The online shows are a different set up than that, but we have been doing a lot of them and it has been good so far.” New songs will be released this summer, material that was recorded in Nashville before the shutdown. They will do as many online shows as possible to connect with fans.  “We can’t look at it negatively because the whole world looks at it negatively,” said Jenna. “When the vaccine is here, we can all have a big party.”"
15,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/entertainment/music/2020/05/15/musicians-releasing-new-cds-with-no-live-shows.html,Local musicians releasing new CDs without the payoff of live shows,['Terry Pender'],"Fri., May 15, 2020","WATERLOO REGION — A unique celebration of the region’s musical talent — spearheaded by the prolific singer-songwriter Lynn Jackson — is on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Next Saturday, Jackson had planned a CD release party at the Starlight in Waterloo. Every track on her new CD — “Lionheart” — includes some of the area’s top musicians. It took months to get everyone’s schedule synchronized for the show, only to see it cancelled. But she is releasing the CD as planned on May 22 anyway. She wrote and produced all but one of the songs on her 11th CD. But because of the number of musical guests, Jackson describes it as a community project. “I really took care to get players I really wanted on each song, and how I wanted each song presented,” said Jackson. “Sometimes I had to wait a couple of months for someone to be free, but I was really patient.” There are 12 musical guests, including — Don Featherstone (sax) Chris Boyne (electribe), Rob Deyman (guitar), John Stuart (guitar), Silvia DiDonato (keys), Jonny Sauder (drums), Scott Fitzpatrick (bass), The Divines (Wendy Carraro, Emily Barkley and Danica Guenette), Allison Corbett (violin) and Wendy Wright (violin). All of them are busy, gigging musicians so a CD launch party was scheduled for May 23 at the Starlight in Waterloo — the first date when everyone could perform together. Then the pandemic hit. Writing the songs, recording the material and packaging her new CD took more than a year of work. Now, with the closure of all live music venues, it feels like there is a big hole in the creative process. “It’s like you haven’t completed a cycle,” said Jackson. “Part of the reward of that cycle is to have a big show, a bunch of people come out, you get feedback, release the album and then go on tour. That whole process is now stunted and you don’t quite get the same feeling of satisfaction.” Her new music, however, is deeply satisfying, and includes a beautiful tribute to Leonard Cohen. Jackson was performing the night of Nov. 7, 2016, when she heard Cohen had died. “Then I came home and started playing Leonard Cohen albums in my studio space,” said Jackson. “I opened some wine, I was just really mourning, and all of a sudden the tears started to flow.” She grabbed a pen and paper and wrote the first verse of what would become “The Sound of Everything (for Leonard Cohen).” After that first verse the lyrics came quickly. When she returned to them a couple of months later, Jackson made only two small changes. “Those lyrics are what came out at that moment,” she said. It sounds like something Cohen would have loved — a mournful and beautiful remembrance with Featherstone on baritone sax and Boyne on Electribe.  “Lionheart” will be released on Busted Flat Records. The only cover is “Working Class Hero,” by John Lennon. With Corbett and Wright both playing violins on this track, Jackson’s cover is unlike any other.  “We did three takes and chose the best one, nice and simple,” said Jackson. Not only is the CD launch party cancelled, Jackson had shows booked for Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton that were also scrapped. So, the CD is available at www.bustedflatrecords.com or www.encorerecords.ca or from lynnjackson.bandcamp.com. Kitchener’s Matt Weidinger knows what it’s like to release a CD when all the venues are closed. He released “Breakage” on May 1, which has nine tracks. Eight are original songs, and one is a cover of Led Zeppelin’s “Going to California.”  Weidinger played guitar on all tracks, and added keys in later. Ben Rollo is on drums and Mark McIntyre plays bass. “We just wanted to get that live feeling, so we just set up in a studio in Toronto, played through the songs a bunch, we picked the best take and then I would start adding stuff onto it,” said Weidinger.  He wrote the material during the first half of 2019. He had CD release shows booked in Ancaster, London, Toronto, Collingwood, Stratford, Kitchener and the Starlight in Waterloo. All of the shows have had to be postponed. “I am tyring to think about how it is possible to do something without having those live shows,” said Weidinger. “It has been tough trying to get my head around that.” Musicians depend on the magic of live performances, when the emotional connections with audiences produce CD sales. Weidinger’s new CD is available on Bandcamp, which is a platform he likes a lot. “They really do support the artists,” he said. When listing the new CD on Bandcamp, Weidinger set the price at $20. But there is also an option to pay more to support the artist, and Bandcamp does not take any of that money. “I’ve had people be very generous and say: ‘Hey, I know you are not working so we are going to give you a little extra for that,’” said Weidinger. During the shutdown Weidinger said he is learning the art of recording. That’s a good way to spend his time during the pandemic because he has his own label. “It is along the lines of that goal, making my own sound, putting my own stamp on the music,” said Weidinger. “If I can learn how to record my own albums from home, in my own studio, I will be able to put material out more frequently and save myself a lot of money.”"

The large window on her right floods the studio behind her family home in Old Westmount with natural light, and a humming electric motor spins the potter's wheel. Donaldson's hands bring to life a piece of clay about the size of a big orange. Potters call this ""throwing the clay."" She is making a teapot — the biggest challenge for a potter. But Donaldson is at the peak of her creative skills. There's no hesitation as the clay glistens with moisture and constantly changes shape with her expert touch. She pushes the clay down onto the spinning wheel, pulls it up and widens it out. ""I can only do the claw-grip thing once, then it gets too tall. So now I am doing what are called side-pulls,"" says Donaldson. ""So, I've got some fingers on the outside and some fingers on the inside, and I am just pulling more or less straight up, and I stop before I get to the top."" Clay gathers on her fingers, so she is constantly rinsing them in a bowl of water next to the wheel. She is so neat in her work she does not wear an apron. Her hands are almost always touching, supporting one another as she works the clay. ""If they are braced on each other, it is just much more stable,"" says Donaldson. She keeps her fingers wet, and the walls of the pot dry. Dry patches can cause the pot to twist, and water in the bottom can cause cracks later on. She wants the base and the opening at the top about three inches wide. At the right time, she checks the thickness of the bottom with a needle. There is a lot going on. And like most experts, Donaldson makes it look easy. The sound of the motor drops as the wheel slows. ""As the pot gets bigger and thinner, it gets a little more vulnerable to distortion, so I just like to work a bit more slowly,"" she says. After about 30 minutes, there is a pot sitting on the wheel. She pulls a wire through the base and lifts it up. Then she turns her attention to the lid, and the spout. She will make both out of the same piece of clay in what's called ""throwing the hump."" It takes about 15 minutes to make the lid. It needs a collar that slips into the opening of the pot so it does not slide off when tea is poured. It needs a knob, sized correctly for the fingers. And it has to be the right width. Again, there is a lot going on. But the clay quickly responds to her touch and a lid emerges from the clump of clay. ""It's so neat. I smile every time I do that. I look at it and say: 'That's so cool,' "" says Donaldson. She uses the wire to cut through the clay again and lifts the lid from the wheel. Now, she makes the spout, which might be the trickiest part of throwing a teapot. No matter how good every other part looks, a poorly made spout will dribble liquid. ""You want it to pour like a dream,"" says Donaldson as her fingers shape the clay into a curved cylinder with a wide base and a narrow opening. She removes the spout from the wheel and lays it on the table to dry with the lid, pot and handle. The handle was actually made first. After the clay is cut and weighed, she kneads it to ensure it is homogenous and smooth. Holding a dry bunch in her left hand above a bowl of water, Donaldson pulls down on the clay. She keeps her hand wet and shapes the tapered clay into a handle. ""Yeah, it is very complex. It's why the teapot is considered the masterpiece of the potter, and why there are lots of not-very-good teapots around,"" says Donaldson. ""They are tricky to make, and a lot of people don't really make much of a study of it. Or if you haven't been doing it for very long, you just haven't noticed the way you can make it better."" On a nearby table are three teapots that won the Craft Ontario Best in Show Award. Beautiful, well-designed teapots take so long to make it is difficult to turn a profit. She does it for the love of crafting a beautiful object. And while she sells some for about $150 each, she donates more to charity auctions. Donaldson's pots often fetch $350 and more at auction.  Teapots are the great love of Donaldson's creative life. However, when it comes to earning money, she looks to her Christmas trees. Donaldson makes about 450 Christmas trees a year and she sells every one. Over the past 25 years she's made thousands. ""They account for a large part of my income in the fall,"" she says. ""In November that's two-thirds of my income just in the tree sales."" It started when her sons, now in their 30s, were in elementary school. She developed the Christmas trees as projects that could easily be done by young students. Every year she volunteered to lead a pottery class in her sons' school. ""I supply bristol board cones that I made years ago as a temporary support. The students roll a small slab and make a pie shaped impression on it with a template. They cut it out and wrap it around the cone and seal it, then they make the balls and apply them to the cone to make the tree,"" says Donaldson. Structurally, the cone is strong and easy to make so children didn't ruin the shape while working on it. The kids rolled little bits of clay into balls and put them on the cones for boughs. ""It was a popular project for kids' classes, really popular,"" Donaldson says. ""And I heard sometimes from mothers, how much they liked it, and they had it sitting out as decor, something their eight-year-old made."" So she made some for the annual sales organized by the Waterloo Potters' Workshop and the Hamilton Potters' Guild. ""I would just sell out whenever I took them to sales, and they still come close to selling out even if I take loads of them,"" says Donaldson. She listens to the chatter of holiday shoppers around her table during November sales. Some people return every year to buy one or more trees. They send Donaldson pictures of the trees in their nativity scenes at home. ""And some people say: 'Oh, I've got a whole forest at home, ' "" says Donaldson. She makes a lot of Christmas trees in the dead of winter. After preparing for the big sales in November and December and celebrating Christmas with her family, making the trees in the new year is deeply relaxing, even cathartic. She listens to audio books while making the trees in several sizes and colours. ""And then I know that I have a few dozen of them made, and I am not trying to crunch through in the fall in time for November,"" she says.  Donaldson's fascination with pottery began when she was 16 years old. Friends of her parents came to the family cottage on Georgian Bay bearing a gift — a teapot and cups made by Bracebridge potter Jon Partridge. The young Donaldson could not stop looking at the pot, holding it up and slowly moving it around. Donaldson says she was mesmerized by the beautiful, handmade object. She still has it in her home. ""It was like I had been struck by lightning,"" says Donaldson. From that moment on, she wanted to be a potter. She started taking courses to prepare for college studies in ceramics and pottery. The Ontario College of Art (now OCAD University) said she was qualified, but it had no ceramics program. She would have to study sculpture and learn to use different materials. There was a potter's wheel under a table in one of the studios. She was welcome to use it but would have to teach herself. Then she considered a budding ceramics program at Sheridan College. It was a good one, but when they heard she was fascinated by teapots they recommended she study under Roger Kerslake at Georgian College in Barrie. Kerslake is famous for his teapots, and Georgian College is halfway between the family home in Toronto and her family's beloved cottage. She jumped at the chance. After finishing the three-year program in ceramics and glass, she moved to Waterloo to be with her husband, Ron. They relocated to Calgary in 1984, and Donaldson worked briefly out of a production studio called the Clay House. After returning to Waterloo in 1989 she worked in the basement, and when they moved into their current house in 2007, on Claremont Avenue in Kitchener, she built a potter's studio in a shed behind the house. Donaldson's teen years not only introduced her to pottery, but also helped form her business practices. Toronto born and raised, Donaldson spent summers at the cottage and helped out in her family's ski shop. Her sister eventually took over the family business in Toronto. Donaldson and her husband took over the cottage. They continue to spend lots of time there. That retail experience taught her valuable lessons about tracking her sales and commissions. She keeps detailed records. ""I know how many I have sold at the sale previous, and whether they have sold out, and whether they sold out on the Friday night of a three-day sale, that kind of thing,"" Donaldson says. ""So then when I try to make more and take more, I try to be organized about it."" She also has a notebook that records every order she's had since starting out as a potter in 1983. Decades after her studies at Georgian College, Donaldson and her former teacher, Roger Kerslake, met again at the opening of a retrospective show of Kerslake's work at the Jonathon Bancroft-Snell Gallery in London, Ont. As a former student, Donaldson was invited to contribute a piece. Her teapot sold before his, Kerslake remembers with a laugh. In an interview, he describes his former student as nice, determined and hard-working, and was not surprised by her fascination with teapots. ""It's a real challenge to make a good teapot,"" Kerslake says. ""It's one of my favourite things to make."" The balance, the form and the demands of perfectly melding several parts into something practical and beautiful takes real talent, he says. ""Either the handle isn't on straight, or the lid falls off, or the spout isn't at the right angle, so therefore it drips or runs down the side,"" he says. ""There are so many different things."" ""It is one of the most difficult forms to pull off,"" agrees Janna Hiemstra, the executive director of Craft Ontario. ""You have to know what you are doing to be able to pull off a teapot,"" Hiemstra says. ""I challenge anybody to try making one. There are not many people with that skill."" Craft Ontario awarded Donaldson the John and Barbara Mather Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2005. ""It is the most prestigious award we give out in the craft community in Ontario,"" Hiemstra says. It is given for outstanding work in support of that community. Donaldson organized conferences, auctions, exhibitions, wrote technical articles about ceramics, reviewed workshops, lectures and special exhibitions. She is a long-standing member of the Waterloo Potters' Workshop and volunteers at the Canadian Clay and Glass Gallery where she is a former board member. She's exhibited at the Clay and Glass Gallery and the Burlington Arts Centre. ""She is really well known in Ontario not only as a ceramic artist, but somebody who has actively worked to make sure the profile for craft is built in the province,"" Hiemstra says.  The shelves on one wall of Donaldson's studio are crowded with cups, bowls, garlic holders, platters, maple syrup containers, butter dishes, coffee mugs, citrus juicers, commemorative baby dishes with the children's name, plates and teapots. In addition to the everyday objects, there are beautiful, unique containers shaped like peppers or big seed pods. These are decorated with white leaves against a dark, smoky background. Her studio is redolent with aroma of roasting coffee beans. Donaldson's husband, Ron, roasts his own beans, and she uses the chaff from those beans for a smoke-firing technique that has won awards. She takes fresh leaves from a plant in her garden. The leaves are held to the outside of the porcelain jar with a thin cotton cord. She covers the bottom of a tinfoil bag with the chaff from the beans in the coffee roaster. She puts the pepper-shaped container with the leaves tied in place into the foil bag and closes it up. The bag then goes into the kiln. The smoke from the chaff colours the peppers, but the moisture from the leaves creates a pattern on the outside. ""That's how the magic is made,"" she says. She won the Primitive Firing Award for that in several juried shows.  At this moment, Donaldson is looking at her would-be teapot – the pot, handle, lid and spout – on her work table. After 24 hours of drying under plastic and cloth, the parts are ready for final assembly. She places the pot on a stainless-steel pedestal that she easily spins with one hand. The pedestal was a Christmas gift from her husband when they lived in Calgary 35 years ago. She uses a small tool to trim extra clay. She uses another tool to punch small holes through the side of the pot where the base of the spout will be attached. Another tool furrows the surface of the smooth clay. Then she applies ""slip,"" a mixture of clay and water, to that area. Gently but firmly, she presses the base of the spout to the pot. It stays in place. Just three years ago, she learned a great trick to create an elegant bend in the tip of the spout to finish the opening and prevent dribbles. She pulls a wire back through the centre of the cylinder from the opening for a short distance and then pulls down the lower half. She smooths over the cuts with her fingers. She attaches the handle after scoring the surface and once again applying ""slip."" The lid is also trimmed and drops neatly into the opening at the top of the pot. She slowly rotates the teapot and looks at her work with an expert eye. ""A lot of us feel this is the most beautiful stage. The clay seems alive, it kind of glows, it is a lot like skin now, it has a bit of moisture, a coolness to it, it's nice and smooth,"" says Donaldson. ""I often photograph my work at this stage."" The teapot must be fired twice in the kiln. The first is called the bisque firing that dries and hardens the clay. The teapot is then cleaned, covered in glaze and fired again in the kiln. ""And hopefully you get something that thrills you again,"" says Donaldson. This article appears in the November-December edition of Grand magazine."

Her first choice was Port Dover, the lovely but expensive town on the shores of Lake Erie.  The building she had her eye on sold before she had a chance to put her foot in the front door. Big disappointment. Then a real estate agent suggested the village of Port Rowan, west of Port Dover, a place rather sleepy and consequently lacking the traffic and hoopla of the larger town, though thousands of tourists do visit every year. It was 2017 and Proctor was excited when she first walked through the building, located on the main drag overlooking the harbour.  It had the right bones, a big backyard and enough space for an art gallery, retail shop and café, plus a little spot for a performance stage.  ""I wanted to be surrounded by art and music and I wanted to live near the water,"" said Proctor, who opened The Gallery Art Bistro earlier this year.  The name of her new business is tattooed on her forearm. ""The purpose of the gallery was to support arts, visual arts and musicians,"" said the mother of two adult sons.  ""I needed a buy-in from the community and the artists."" And she got it, with only a bit of pushback from a couple of local residents who were unsure what this outsider was bringing to their quiet village, she says. Once she had all the municipal permissions in place and contractors hired, Proctor rolled up her sleeves and set her hands and imagination to work. She would need both. For 14 years the 1924 building had been a discount store, its faded walls crammed to the ceiling with stuff.  Redeveloping would be a huge project but for the artist who usually works in acrylic on canvas, she saw the space as a giant art project, a challenge. ""I saw beyond the clutter,"" she said. During the renovation she found one lovely surprise that would form a foundation for the look of the place: An interior brick wall covered in sea foam green paint. She scraped off just enough to give the wall a distressed but modern feel. Perfect, thought the 50-year-old, who used the green throughout the bistro, set against the white freshness of Ikea furniture.  She also included a basket of various percussion instruments, such as shakers, for customers to play along with musicians at weekly open-mike nights. It's not really surprising that the artist proved so entrepreneurial. Proctor grew up in Cambridge. Her father, Larry Olney, owned eight A&W restaurants and though she worked in the family business for a while, it really wasn't what she wanted to do. For a decade, Proctor worked as a paramedic in Mississauga.  In 2003, she suffered a serious spinal injury and was relegated to desk duties, though even that proved too painful. So she quit.  Following surgery in the United States, Proctor returned to school, first studying business at Wilfrid Laurier University then marketing at Conestoga College, where she won a provincial award in 2009 and worked in marketing for five years.  Proctor said this background in business and marketing gave her the edge she needed to launch the gallery. In terms of art, she had studied in college for a year before joining her father's business. While recovering from surgery, she returned to the canvas full time. By 2016, Proctor was starting to take her work into the public, an experience she described as ""terrifying putting yourself out there.""  But her art with its whimsical animal, nature and musical themes — plus use of brilliant colours — caught the eye of buyers. ""People starting telling me 'You're good,' "" she said. ""I've always had art in my life."" She is already making plans to expand the bistro, including hiring a chef to create a menu, and she has collaborated with several artists and businesses from Cambridge, such as Monigram Coffee Roasters, a company that helped set up her café and train the baristas.  Plus, she carries works from Hilborn Pottery Design and treats from Reid Candy and Nut Shop, both from Cambridge, and she has hosted several local and Guelph musicians.  ""Most of the other art is mine except three artists local to the Port Rowan area,"" said Proctor, who divides her time between her house in Cambridge and an apartment across the street from the bistro. vhill@therecord.com Twitter: @HillRecord"

It may seem there’s a huge chasm between them, but the space is much less than we think. As we begin to come together again with family and friends — with our community — we talk about the life we lived before the pandemic and look to the life we might live after. Between Before and After lies what is possible. It’s a space to think, to reflect, to dream, to innovate. It is the space, perhaps, where there is a stillness, like that needed for prayer. These are lessons captured by Inuit artist Elisapee Ishulutaq and her painting “Tusiarvik (A Place for Prayer)” — in which an understanding of what went before leads to innovation and creation. “As an artist who participated in the founding of the print studio in Pangnirtung (in Nunavut), Ishulutaq is recognized as a pioneer of artmaking in her community and thus given the respect due an elder,” Christine Lalonde wrote of Ishulutaq, who died in 2018, in the catalogue “Builders.” “Despite being the elder in the group, Ishulutaq emerged as the most capable and ready to experiment … New directions are not only taken up by emerging artists, they are pursued actively by elder artists whose technical experience allows them to adapt processes to new media with confidence and perhaps innovate further than their younger contemporaries,” wrote Lalonde, associate curator of Indigenous art at the National Gallery of Canada. In “Vision, Space, Desire: Global Perspectives and Cultural Hybridity,” Indigenous artist and curator Jolene Rickard, quoted by Lalonde, notes that Indigenous artists “have densely packed cultural survival kits that transfer knowledge from one generation to the next, despite unremitting attempts at genocide, culturacide, and other forms of political and philosophical erasure. Native communities or nations have something the world needs to know about: the insight of continuity.” Instead of forgetting the past, we must learn from it. Let us share our stories, our experiences; let the time we’ve spent become part of our collective knowledge. Then we can weave the past and present in a future that has learned its lessons."

These Toronto curators can help you find it,['Sue CarterSpecial to the Star'],"Fri., July 10, 2020","On Canada Day, a group of 16 artists gathered in Kensington Market to produce a colourful street mural, each painting a letter of “Black Lives Matter” on Augusta Street in their own unique style. For some passersby, this may have been their first encounter with work by local Black artists. While more people are examining the books on their shelves and the TV shows they stream for anti-Black racism, visual arts consumption is often ignored. For those who want to start buying Black art but don’t know where to start, we asked four curators for their advice. Check out alternative spaces and you might find the next star. If it hadn’t been for COVID-19, this would have been the third year that freelance photographer and videographer Tiana Smith curated a Pride month show at 187 Augusta dedicated to artists who “push the boundaries of society by existing and creating their art as 2SQTBIPOC.”  Smith, a stylist who always has a camera in tow, credits the show with opening up opportunities for her own portrait photography at larger venues like the ROM.  “When I look around, other than Church Street, I haven’t really seen a lot of queer Black people being able to take up space and sharing their work in a way that isn’t tokenizing them or making them feel small,” says Smith. “I’m really proud of the way my work showcases women of colour and other people who aren’t of the norm. When I’m able to showcase queer folks and what they actually look like, I’m advocating for more representation for queer people.” Keosha Love’s spoken word practice, poetry and art curation intersects with her work as an activist and as the founder of Our Women’s Voices, which aims to create safe spaces for marginalized women through community. The recent Ryerson University grad has already appeared in several major brand campaigns by the likes of Nike and Absolut, who have recognized Love’s multi-faceted work. Love recommends that, before taking a trip to a major gallery, people spend time online seeking out artists through their websites and Instagram.  “Most don’t have the liberty of getting a gallery showcase; those things are privileges that not all BIPOC artists have,” says Love, using the acronym for Black, Indigenous and people of colour. “Try searching up some local BIPOC artists and go to their websites. It’s the best way to support them.” Love’s advice is backed by numbers. Recently, Palestinian-Canadian artist Ibrahim Abusitta published a spreadsheet on Instagram in which he tallied the number of artists who are Black, Indigenous or persons of colour represented by Toronto commercial galleries. Of the 18 galleries surveyed, only 11 of the 454 artists Abusitta counted are Black. Some of those artists are dead. This abysmal number was not a surprise to John Samuels (a.k.a. rapper Just John), artistic director of the arts coalition Blank Canvas, which won a $20,000 Toronto Arts Foundation Award last year for its work with marginalized youth. While much of the public discussion right now is centred around anti-Black racism in specific cultural institutions and the systems that have kept artists’ work out of galleries and collectors’ hands, Samuels believes it’s time to think bigger. He sees an opportunity to completely reinvent the art world, top to bottom, including how art is purchased. “People who want to buy Black artists’ work also need to reimagine how they’re supporting artists and how they’re supporting Black communities,” he says.  Samuels suggests investigating grassroots arts organizations like Blank Canvas, the Black Legal Action Centre or the Nia Centre for the Arts, which just announced plans to build Canada’s first multidisciplinary centre for African-Canadian art. “I think it’s really about having willingness to learn and educate yourself because if you don’t know who the artist is, or where this artwork is coming from or the rootedness of it, it’s out of sight, out of mind,” Samuels says. Artist and curator James Hewitt understands that, for many people, walking into a commercial gallery and asking about artworks can be an intimidating experience. The OCAD University grad cut his teeth at various spaces, including stints assisting Paul Petro and beloved late Parkdale gallerist Katharine Mulherin, immersing himself in all aspects of the business. Hewitt is now preparing to open his own gallery, The Run, this month in the Runnymede and Annette neighbourhood.  Together with his business partner, photographer Michael Jewer, Hewitt envisions a space that makes people feel at ease. He selected his initial stable of Black and Indigenous artists — many of whom he’s exhibited with in the past — for their “dynamic perspectives and ideas.”  Hewitt, whose own expressive figurative charcoal drawings will also be exhibited at the gallery, recommends that new collectors start small with original works. “Build patronage with the artists that you admire. If you can, try to build a friendship or relationship,” says Hewitt. “Try to have real conversations with them so that it takes some mythology away from the artist and it makes them less intimidating. You can learn a lot about their work just through talking.” Here are five artists to start your search: Jacquie Comrie Dubbed the queen of colour, Comrie’s vivid geometric murals and canvases make you feel good, thanks to her grounding research on the healing power of colour on mental well-being.

If we can’t be with people, do we forget how to connect? No. Instead, we find new ways of sharing and understanding each other.  The students at Etobicoke School of the Arts, like other pupils honing their creativity across the city, the country and the world, usually have a year-end exhibition. They show and sell their work, hold a Portfolio Day to showcase the fruits of their labour and create connections with the larger, outside world.  This year, the Class of 2020 has taken the sale online.  “The tension with teaching and having the sale online is the loss of personal interaction with other people,” observes Matthew Varey, head of contemporary art at the Toronto high school. “We are used to engaging with brilliant, creative, humble, powerful and ambitious people every day. That is the loss I am feeling, and the one I hear from the students that is being felt most deeply.” For Ella Webber, the just-graduated Grade 12 student and young artist who painted this portrait of “Charlotte,” her art is a way of connecting with her peers, with the people she encounters in the world each day. She creates large-scale portraits — the size of the art, she says, “increases the intimate connection that I share with it, strengthening my personal bond with my subjects and allowing my paintings to take on a life of their own.  “Through portraits I’m working to understand the complexities, nuances and possibilities of human connection.”  In exhibition, her portraits command our attention. The people in them demand we see their perspective and understand their stories.  These students are graduating to a wider world. By supporting them in their creativity and understanding the way they see the world, together we can all graduate to a better one.  To see the exhibition, learn more about these young artists or to buy a painting, go to the online sale at www.esava.ca. Half of the sale price goes to the students and half to the school — to inspire and support more students to create, and in so doing to encourage all of us to see the world through fresh eyes. "

He collaborated with University of Guelph professor, Kim Anderson, on ""Injichaag,"" a collection of his poetry, paintings and autobiography, released last December. The two of them shared the stage Dec. 3 in a series on Indigeneity for Third Age Learning in Waterloo. He played a native flute, read a few of his poems and told stories from his life. That he was well-received is an understatement: more than 60 copies of his book were sold that day! I contacted him after the Waterloo event and we met in the art-filled living room of his Guelph home on Jan. 22, which turned out to be his 73rd birthday. There are many books now exploring the cultural genocide dealt by the Residential Schools in Canada. ""Injichaag"" is one in which the nuns in Meshake's Longlac Indian Day School failed ""to take the Indian out of the child,"" as Sir John A. Macdonald had demanded in establishing the mission of the residential schools and the Indian Act.  Meshake was blessed by having lived on the land with his grandmother (Nookomis) for his first 10 years, before entering the infamous school. And then by having a Mother Superior who was more interested in helping him discover his talents (via penmanship and art) than in eradicating his background. But he was sexually abused by a Catholic lay brother and could not rise above the shame to report his abuser. Nevertheless his twin matriarchs — grandmother and nun — were key to his survival, and a spirituality today that blends native and Catholic elements. The facts of Meshake's life are recorded in Anderson's introduction, a more linear version of the anecdotes and word reclamations that make up the rest of the book. He was born in 1948 in Nakina. His mother took him home the next day to Aroland, part of the Longlac reserve settlement near Geraldton in northern Ontario. His grandmother provided his ""bush education"" in between periods at the native schools in Aroland and Longlac. From 1955-66 he was sent to the McIntosh residential school in northwestern Ontario. This period was the peak of residential school enrolment: in all, 150,000 children were interned between the late 1800s and 1996.  Very little of his school life there is included in ""Injichaag."" Anderson explains that Meshake's feelings of shame and inferiority were consistent with the body of literature about residential school life. His poor self-esteem was worsened by the deaths of his mother in 1960 and grandmother the following year. He did manage to finish high school in Thunder Bay and, at age 18 in 1966, enrolled in graphic design at Sheridan College in Toronto. What followed graduation were years of wandering, including work as a firefighter and tree planter with his father in Geraldton, and as a graphic designer. But he was medicating his rage and depression with alcohol. He married in 1978 but left his wife and stepchildren in '83, ending up on the streets in Winnipeg for three years and then six years of homelessness and alcoholism in Toronto. The turning point, as he tells it in the story ""Eshpinadaa,"" came in 1991. He waited for a store in Chinatown to open so he could buy a jug of Chines cooking wine to share with his buddies. He looked up at the street sign for Spadina Avenue and realized it was an Anishinaabe word Shba'-dinnaa, meaning rising hills or mountaintop. ""I cried out to the Creator, Give me life or death, no matter how! Do whatever it takes! I don't give a s---!"" It was at the burial of his best friend, who had died in an alcoholic coma, where Meshake buried his past. From there he found an Anishinaabe health clinic and a social worker named Alex who mentored him into sobriety via three native healing lodges. ""So that word Eshpadinaa has been very significant on my journey. Because you worship the Creator on a high hill, on a high place. And I've been climbing the hill ever since."" He also had a dream around that time in which his ancestors told him not to be afraid of his words. This book ends with a five-page glossary, a reminder of all the Anishinaabek words he teaches the reader and reclaims for himself. It was during his recovery that Rene met Joan, a social worker, who would become his second wife. He credits her with helping him maintain his ""fast"" from alcohol and build a home together in Guelph. The recent Truth and Reconciliation payment to residential school survivors went to paying off his mortgage and investing in computers, art supplies and musical instruments. Currently he is collaborating via the internet with a native composer in British Columbia. He hopes to put some of his Anishinaabek words and poems to music for a cabaret-style performance.  After our interview he was flying with Joan and Anderson to Winnipeg to launch his book at the International Writers Festival. ""Seven generations from now, I hope my people will read this book written by their ancestor. This is my legacy, something that will outlive me.""  ""Injichaag"" is a soul journey that reverberates with me, part of the path of decolonization and reconciliation. Happy Birthday, Rene!

23,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/entertainment/books/2020/01/03/chuck-erion-a-pilgrimage-to-eternity.html,"Chuck Erion: ""A Pilgrimage to Eternity""",[],"Fri., Jan. 3, 2020","""A Pilgrimage to Eternity"" by Timothy Egan (Viking, $37.00 hardcover, also ebook, 367 pages) Many, many people (over 300,000 in 2017) each year hike the Camino de Santiago in Spain. I can even count half a dozen Camino pilgrims among my friends. But I had not heard of Via Francigena, the pilgrimage which runs from Canterbury to Rome, until reading Timothy Egan's book, released in October. Egan is a Pulitzer-winning reporter and columnist for the New York Times and author of eight other books. He grew up in an Irish-American Catholic family but his relationship with the church is, well, complicated. It is clouded by the recent death of his devout mother, and the pending death from cancer of his sister-in-law. Also his brother left the church when his best friend committed suicide after the sexual abuse by a priest was made public. The Via Francigena thousand-mile route was first traced by Sigiric, the Archbishop of Canterbury in 880 AD. It begins at Canterbury Cathedral in England, crosses to France and runs roughly parallel to the border with Belgium and Germany. The trail rises into the Swiss Alps before descending into Italy's Tuscany and Siena regions, ending at St Peter's in Rome. As Egan discovers, one reason it is less popular (1,200 travellers in 2012) than the Santiago is the lack of dedicated accommodations and infrastructure. Egan is doing the trek for more than personal reasons. He wants to visit the churches, abbeys and religious sites that marked the spread of Christianity in the medieval centuries. Where is religion, the dominant force in earlier eras, in modern European culture? He hopes for a chance to interview Pope Francis when he gets to Rome, to gauge his impact on a church in crisis. His first steps in Canterbury are underwhelming. A bone fragment and a piece of vestments from Thomas � Becket are behind glass in the Martyr's Chapel of Saint Thomas Catholic Church. He feels unmoved and bemused when he can't buy a copy of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in the gift shop, told that it's too bawdy to sell in a church. But outside he spots the first Via Francigena trail-marker, a pilgrim in a monk's robe with a walking stick. And he meets two young women also beginning the pilgrimage. The reader tags along, intrigued by the history of each town, city or countryside he passes through. Egan had not trained for the physical challenges of hiking a thousand miles on foot. He is also no purist, opting for rail or bus transport when the weather turns hot or the trail follows the edge of a busy highway. Foot problems plague the final stages of his route. His son, his daughter and later his wife each join him for segments but most of the time he is alone, though not without a cellphone. I was intrigued by the chapter on St. Maurice/St. Moritz in Switzerland. My dad never liked his middle name, Maurice, after Maurice Chevalier, the French actor and a heartthrob of my grandmother. He pronounced it ""Morris"" not ""Moreese"" but he might've felt differently if he'd known about the saint from the third century who was beheaded by the Roman emperor Maximian. It wasn't until 1250 that Maurice's statue, clearly showing his Black African race, was erected in Madeburg, Germany. He is the guiding saint of the Swiss Guard, protectors of the pope, and almost 600 houses of worship around the world bear his name. Why do people go on pilgrimages in this secular age? Egan asks this of a Tuscan priest in the Abbey of San Capresio, one of the oldest monasteries on the route. He finds that pilgrims (women outnumber men) want to talk about their marriages, their jobs, their families. ""My sense is that people who do the whole Via end up with a major change in how they live."" Egan asks if they become more spiritual. ""Not necessarily. They learn how to think more clearly."" The priest goes on to explain his theory that modern-day Italians have lost the daily habit of a siesta, running in ever faster circles of work and money.  This reminds me of my first trip to Tuscany in 2003 and my take-away from living in that gorgeous countryside: ""la dolce far niente,"" or ""the sweetness of doing nothing."" At the dawn of the 2020s we could all find ways to think more clearly, and to rediscover the pleasures of idleness, he said just after taking a siesta. ""A Pilgrimage to Eternity"" provides some encouraging light on the trail forward. Chuck Erion is the former co-owner of Words Worth Books, Waterloo "

With that in mind, Sophie Mackintosh follows up her debut “The Water Cure” (which was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2018) with a new take on patriarchal dystopia. When a girl in this new state begins menstruating, she is selected by random lottery to either become a wife and mother (receiving a white ticket) or be fitted with an IUD so she can enter into a career (the blue ticket of the title). Calla gets a blue ticket but finds the resulting freedom (“My time belonged to me, my life was only mine.”) to be an ambiguous blessing. After getting pregnant she has to make a run for the border, as it’s open season on wayward women like her. The feminist message is presented in stark terms. Men are nameless, senseless brutes while, among women, there is at least the possibility of fellow-feeling. Calla’s pregnancy both turns her inward and makes her more in tune with nature: transforming her into “a warm-blooded female animal” who speaks to rocks and dirt. What is more interesting, however, is Calla’s evolving understanding of the operation of individual free will in conflict with society, and the relation between agency and responsibility. Burn-In By P. W. Singer and August Cole Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 417 pages, $39.98  A surprise comes right on the second page of “Burn-In.” It takes the form of an endnote. The presence of endnotes signals what the authors have dubbed “useful fiction” meant to “aid broader engagement with the thorny issues related to technology and society that will soon become all too real.” Or which are real already, since all the technology is drawn from current research. Hence the endnotes. The delivery vehicle for this cutting-edge messaging is an action thriller that follows the typical buddy-cop formula. FBI agent Lara Keegan is uncomfortably paired up with a new police robot named TAMS (Tactical Autonomous Mobility System) that represents the latest “meld of evolution and engineering.” Together, this odd couple must foil a gang of technoterrorists. All SF engages to some degree with issues relating to technology and society, so the “useful fiction” label isn’t very helpful. But it does give you some idea of how the authors target hot-button political issues of the day, and “Burn-In” will definitely appeal to those who want to stay one page ahead of the headlines. Network Effect By Martha Wells Tor, 352 pages, $36.50  Over the last few years the character of Murderbot has become an SF sensation. Murderbot is a security cyborg with a difference, a killing machine who loves binge-watching television dramas in his down time while making wry observations about his human charges. His adventures have been documented thus far in a series of four novellas known as “The Murderbot Diaries.” “Network Effect” is the first novel. Though it’s a standalone work, you’d be advised to read the Diaries first. Many of the characters are recurring, including a transport ship named ART who has as much attitude as Murderbot and plays a central role in the story. Though there’s lots of action, what makes Murderbot so engaging is his voice. Murderbot is never as interested in what’s going on around him as he is in talking to himself, and even when blowing things up or shooting bad guys he remains withdrawn. A heavy use of parentheses has the effect of reinforcing his obsessive interiority. He likes his extended human family well enough but they’re hard to relate to. It may be that ART is the only one capable of drawing him out of his armoured shell. The Oppenheimer Alternative By Robert J. Sawyer Red Deer Press, 392 pages, $24.95  In “The Oppenheimer Alternative,” award-winning SF writer Robert J. Sawyer heads in a slightly different direction. As the story begins, we’re in the world of thoroughly researched historical fiction, with the scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer (“Oppie”) heading to work on the Manhattan Project, the code name for America’s effort to create an atomic bomb. From here, however, things soon spin into alternate- or secret-history territory as it’s discovered that the solar system is about to experience a catastrophic meltdown, forcing the assembled all-stars of theoretical physics to become not the destroyers but the saviours of the world. You can always count on Sawyer, a storyteller of the first order, for a good read. “The Oppenheimer Alternative” delivers on that count, but it’s also a book that explores, on a human level, the sort of bigger questions raised by such world-changing events, both real and imagined."

At 11 a.m., ravenous, I amble into my parents’ basement for breakfast. I count seven family-sized bags of yam tortilla chips, thirty-two cans of cream of mushroom soup, two forty-pound bags of jasmine rice, and seven bottles of blue dishwashing liquid. Name it, and we most likely have it, buried under the bulk bird seed on Shelf 8. “Told you to always stock up for emergencies,” my mother announces. I roll my eyes, but I help her set a trap for our ongoing rodent problem. Diaspora, like heart-exploding grief, OCD, and excessive ambition, has both wrecked and strengthened our family. My Chinese family belongs to a particular sect of professional hoarders, and this current pandemic has only validated their lifestyle. Like many once impoverished immigrants, we have been preparing — AKA paranoid — for multiple global disasters long before COVID-19 happened. I once used to scoff at this gratuitous habit of radical saving and stockpiling on repeat, but it makes sense to me now.  For as long as I can remember, my parents have resisted the preternatural tug of the homeland. It wasn’t until March 2019 that the siren call, like severe tinnitus, became impossible to ignore. Off to Hong Kong we embarked, a place of once vicious famine and long-squashed dreams. It would be my first time in Asia, and I couldn’t bear to turn down a complimentary trip. Upon leaving Hong Kong International Airport, as if by sorcery, the humidity freshened my sandpaper skin, and volumized my iron-flat Vancouverite hair. It was as if the city was welcoming it’s long lost, weirdo daughter with a makeover. Our week was a flurry of show and tell and, one day, we went to my parents’ respective villages. We took the MTR from Mong Kok, bussed on public transit, rode a train, which was followed by multiple taxi rides to the slums. It took 4.5 hours to get there. Finally, my mother, almost shyly, showed us her childhood home-school, built on top of a creepy open-hole graveyard, and talked about how she would play with the jutting bones of corpses as a child. The grotesque trees, arthritic-looking and uncared for, made me so sad I felt everything turn to decay inside me. “No wonder you’re so messed up,” I blurted, and instantly regretted it. “You’re the one who’s messed up,” she retorted in Cantonese. “Can’t do math, complains all the time about stomach aches-” “No,” I said, shivering despite the heat. “I mean, this is why you are so scared of ghosts and starving to death.” “Um, yeah,” she said, smacking me on the back of my head. I groaned. But then she sighed, eyebrows furrowing together. She glanced around, no longer a simple tourist, as if really looking for the first time, seemingly sorrowful at the dilapidated graves scattered around us. Did she regret coming back? However she felt, for the first time I understood her fear of scarcity, this ancient inherited trauma. After all, I felt diaspora was best suited for gamblers, entrepreneurs, great white sharks, and hopeless optimists. For the rest of us, mediocres and sentimentalists, when you involuntarily hop country and home, you accumulate a Tantalus gluttony, and you fill the physical void with pragmatic things that can be eaten, bartered or saved. POC, especially impoverished ones like my mother, understand that shit inevitably happens, and it’s best to be prepared. Nice housing is only provisional. “We’re never coming back,” my mother finally pronounced, and we followed her, like a congregation of fruit flies — far away from her private destitution to our four-star hotel, our temporary home in Asia. As for me, I didn’t mind Hong Kong at all. In fact, it felt like I had almost never left Vancouver. Everyone looked exactly like me, neither worse nor better. For the remaining trip, we ate and shopped like the middle-class we aspired to be, as if we were badass rice-eaters on vacation instead of scared immigrants on their homecoming. I arrived back in Canada with fifteen cheap polyester dresses, all beaded, lacy and ridiculous, and I decided I was ready for any literary event, Comic-Con or Halloween. It only fazed me a little that being a size 2 in North America meant that I was XXXL in Asia. In my eccentric, complicated glory, I realized that I’d become capitalism’s bitch and my mother’s daughter: more is better and surplus is safer.  In my parents’ world, though, it often feels like I’m tumbling backwards when my peers are levelling up with adulting in the guise of matrimony, mortgages, babies, promotions. I tell myself when the pandemic is over, surely I’ll move into the RV parked on the driveway or perhaps a distant relation (that I don’t know of) will die, leaving me money and allowing me to purchase a sea vessel. Wouldn’t it be super-fun to live on a houseboat? I think excitedly. You could throw your roommates, friends, lovers, and family members overboard whenever they were too loud or obnoxious. COVID-19 may be my generation’s diaspora, but it’s also my family’s latest, haunting trauma. At my parents’ dwelling, I have a recurring high-stress nightmare where I am trying to frantic-pack a wheelie suitcase because the building is supposed to explode in two minutes. Panicked, I hurl clothing into a never ending black hole of fabric. Fed up, I zip up the case, but it expands like an inflatable balloon. Screeching, I beseech the suitcase to rescale to a normal size. Action-heroine I am not, and the suitcase knows this. Eventually, it grows so unwieldy and wide that it doesn’t fit through the door frame, but I’m relentless and determined enough to save all my belongings, even though I know I’m doomed. Then, as the building ignites, special effects inferno-BOOM!, homegirl wakes up-all lock-jawed, sweat-stinky, and terrified. It is a shame to lose all my things! I growl, and regretful I am in this waking life, and so I wonder where I had purchased the defective suitcase. Who do I blame, really, but myself? Anything, at any moment in flight, might turn out to be unbearable, might transform into a sign of absurdity that one might never escape."

The stories of excess that make for great anecdotes in rock memoirs, he found, were “Kryptonite for a reader’s connection with characters.”  And if, as the saying goes, describing music is like dancing about architecture, then “writing about nonexistent songs,” the English novelist says, “is a double dance.” But Mitchell is not one to back down from a challenge and “Utopia Avenue” is a 550-page-long triple album in literary form. Each chapter shares its title with a song from one of the band’s three releases and each is told through the songwriter’s own perspective. Mitchell’s writing has always been a bit prog-rock, especially the unorthodox structures he invents. His 2004 novel “Cloud Atlas” (adapted for film in 2012 by the Wachowskis) nests six different narratives from six different genres within one another; and his last book, “Slade House” (2015), includes five related horror stories, each set nine years later than the last.  What’s more, stories and characters overlap between his books. In “Utopia Avenue,” Luisa Rey, heroine of the “airport thriller” section of “Cloud Atlas,” reappears as a band member’s girlfriend. Guitarist Jasper de Zoet turns out to be descended from the titular 18th-century Dutch trader in “The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet” (2010) — and, like his ancestor, his own story slides into dark fantasy, a twist on the rock ’n’ roll trope of selling your soul to the devil. Of course, Mitchell would not grace international bestseller lists as often as he does if he were simply an ambitious virtuoso. “Utopia Avenue” is big-hearted and emotionally rich. And while the band’s three songwriters — Jasper, bassist Dean Moss and keyboardist Elf (or Elizabeth Frances) Holloway — aren’t averse to sex, drugs or rock ’n’ roll tomfoolery, they also grapple with personal issues. Dean is trying to come to terms with the abuse he endured in childhood, Jasper with the voices he hears in his head, Elf with her sexuality. Their struggles resonate with tectonic cultural shifts. The novel is set in 1967-68 when, in both the U.K. and the U.S., previously marginalized views about civil liberties and human rights had evolved into a robust counterculture. “Idealism was vital and organized enough to gain mass self-expression,” says Mitchell, on a web chat from his home in West Cork, Ireland, “and it wasn’t old enough for cynicism and jadedness to have wilted its appeal.”  Hence the optimism underlying his fictional band’s name. And yet, when Mitchell was writing the book, “Trump got elected, Brexit happened and I would often berate myself: ‘This is all 50 years ago. You should be writing about now.’ Of course, reality has the last laugh: suddenly it doesn’t feel so distant. Sometimes the pendulum swings back and people do believe. Ideas demonstrably can and do change, if not the world in its totality, certainly aspects of it. ‘The statue was there; the statue’s not there. Here’s the idea; here’s the change.’” So, to ask Mitchell a question posed to his fictional band in a press conference, can songs — or any kind of art — change the world?  “Art is like the heat on a stove. If the hob on your cooker goes from 0 up to 9 — or 0 to 11 in honour of ‘Spinal Tap’ — it’s rare that art makes things boil, but certainly art has a sort of 1-to-4 setting that’s pretty constant on consumers of that art. “The nature of the transformation might not be obvious. When I was a kid, listening to Rush’s ‘Moving Pictures,’ why that album, again and again and again? I couldn’t articulate it then and it’s hard to articulate now but, at some level, it was interacting with my imagination and maybe having a formative effect on it.” In “Utopia Avenue,” Jasper calls songs “seeds” that sometimes take root in fertile minds, and suggests “life could be, should be, better than this. An invitation to slip into somebody else’s skin for a little while.” One chapter is structured around the reactions of a fan whom Elf can see as she’s singing an autobiographical song in concert, which builds a kind of kinship between them, across a crowded club. They glimpse something of themselves in one another. The same happens when Mitchell’s characters meet real-life rockers in the book. Elf has a heart-to-heart with Janis Joplin about being a woman in a phallocentric business, and Jasper and the Rolling Stones’ doomed Brian Jones discuss feeling haunted.  “Utopia Avenue” is strewn with cameos from musicians who have since passed on to that great gig in the sky — from Syd Barrett to David Bowie to Sandy Denny to Jimi Hendrix to Frank Zappa — and they’re there not only as Easter eggs for music geeks, but as advancers of the plot, Greek choristers or dispensers of (sometimes crazy) wisdom. Mitchell has fun with them too: he introduces Leonard Cohen as a man in the elevator of the Chelsea Hotel whose aftershave “smells of tea and oranges” (a nod to the Cohen composition “Suzanne”). “Novels are alive with background details that ring true, or smell or feel true,” says Mitchell, “and that has to come from somewhere, so why not from a song?” In some of the novel’s most vivid, immersive passages, real-life figures serve as guides — for readers and characters alike — to a different reality.  The band’s manager, transplanted Torontonian Levon Frankland, meets artist Francis Bacon and follows him on a phantasmagoric journey through a demimonde of transgressive London clubs — and then explains to him his own calling as an enabler of others’ art. In another, Dean drops acid with the Grateful Dead’s Jerry Garcia, who leads him through a warped San Francisco, complete with a talking burger bun, to an unexpected personal reckoning with his past. And Cohen invites Elf to a rooftop party where, despite feeling embarrassed about her own work, she sings a new song that seems to conjure up her loved one out of thin air. “Like most of us,” says Mitchell, “I’ve got a particular relationship with music. It’s a mood-enhancer; it’s a calmer-downer; occasionally it’s a transcendental drug. Music is many things, but pretty much all of them life-enhancing.” And this can be true, as “Utopia Avenue proves,” even when it doesn’t exist."
29,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/entertainment/movies/2020/07/07/venice-film-festival-forges-ahead-with-reduced-lineup.html,Venice Film Festival forges ahead with reduced lineup,['Lindsey BahrThe Associated Press'],"Tue., July 7, 2020","The show will go on for the Venice Film Festival in September, but with a few modifications due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Organizers said Tuesday that they are pushing forward with plans for its 77th instalment, which will include a slightly reduced number of films in the main competition as well as some outdoor and virtual screenings. If the schedule stays intact, it will be the first major film festival since COVID-19 essentially shut down the industry in mid-March. Festival director Alberto Barbera said in a statement that he is “extremely pleased that the Biennale Cinema can be held with a minimum reduction of films and sections” and that “a significant number of directors and actors will accompany films to the Lido.” There will still be 50 to 55 films in the official selection, which will be announced on July 28, and screenings will take place in the traditional venues as well as two outdoor arenas (at the Giardini della Biennale and a skating rink on the Lido) with adopted safety measures established by authorities. The festival will take its Virtual Reality section online and this year forego its Sconfini section, which hosts smaller films and genre fare, to accommodate more socially distanced screenings of the major films in competition. Actress Cate Blanchett is presiding over the main competition jury. Travel to Italy, an early epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, is allowed from European countries. The European Union last week said it would reopen its border to 14 nations, but most Americans have been refused entry due to soaring coronavirus infections in the U.S. Press from countries with travel restrictions will be able to view press conferences virtually, Barbera said. “Without forgetting the countless victims of these past few months to whom due tribute shall be paid, the first international festival following the forced interruption dictated by the pandemic becomes the meaningful celebration of the re—opening we all looked forward to, and a message of concrete optimism for the entire world of cinema which has suffered greatly from this crisis,” Barbera said. The Toronto International Film Festival, which is typically held on the heels of Venice in September, has already announced plans for a smaller 2020 version, with fewer films and virtual red carpets. Both festivals serve as major launching grounds for awards hopefuls, although no one know how exactly it will work now that runway to the Oscars has been extended by two months. The Venice Film Festival runs from Sept. 2-12."
30,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/entertainment/movies/2020/07/spaghetti-western-movie-composer-ennio-morricone-dead-at-91.html,Spaghetti Western movie composer Ennio Morricone dead at 91,"[""Frances D'EmilioThe Associated Press""]","Mon., July 6, 2020","ROME - Ennio Morricone, the Oscar-winning Italian composer who created the coyote-howl theme for the iconic Spaghetti Western “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” and often haunting soundtracks for such classic Hollywood gangster movies as “The Untouchables” and the epic “Once Upon A Time In America,” died Monday. He was 91. Morricone’s longtime lawyer, Giorgio Assumma, said “the Maestro,” as he was known, died in a Rome hospital of complications following surgery after a recent fall in which he broke a leg bone. Outside the hospital, Assumma read a farewell message from Morricone. “I am Ennio Morricone, and I am dead,” began the message. In the greeting, the composer went on to explain that the only reason he was saying goodbye this way and had requested a private funeral was: “I don’t want to bother anyone.” During a career that spanned decades and earned him an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Morricone collaborated with some of Hollywood’s and Italy’s top directors, including on “The Untouchables” by Brian de Palma, “The Hateful Eight” by Quentin Tarantino , “The Battle of Algiers” by Gillo Pontecorvo and “Nuovo Cinema Paradiso,” a nostalgic ode to the importance of movie houses in Italian small town life, by Giuseppe Tornatore. The Tarantino film would win him the Oscar for best original score in 2016. In accepting that award, Morricone told the audience at the ceremony: “There is no great music without a great film that inspires it.” In total, he produced more than 400 original scores for feature films. His iconic so-called Spaghetti Western movies saw him work closely with the late Italian film director Sergio Leone, a former classmate. Morricone practically reinvented music for Western genre movies through his partnership with Leone. Their partnership included the “Dollars” trilogy starring Clint Eastwood as a quick-shooting, lonesome gunman: “A Fistful of Dollars” in 1964, “For a Few Dollars More” in 1965 and “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” a year later. Morricone was celebrated for crafting just a few notes — like the four notes played on a miniature pan flute favoured by a character in Leone’s 1984 movie “Once Upon A Time in America” — that would instantly become a film’s highly memorable motif. That movie is a saga about Jewish gangsters in New York that explores themes of friendship, lost love and the passing of time, starring Robert De Niro and James Woods. It is considered by some to be Leone’s masterpiece, thanks in part to Morricone’s evocative score, including a lush section played on string instruments. “Inspiration does not exist,” Morricone said in a 2004 interview with The Associated Press. “What exists is an idea, a minimal idea that the composer develops at the desk, and that small idea becomes something important.” In a later interview, with Italian state TV, Morricone cited “study, discipline and curiosity” as the keys to his creative genius. “Writing music, like all creative arts, comes from a long path” along life’s experiences, he said. “A great phenomenon of world music” was how Italian film director Dario Argento described Morricone, who scored five of his films. In his late 80s, Morricone provided the score for “The Hateful Eight,” Tarantino’s 2015 70-mm epic and the first time in decades that he had composed new music for a Western. It was also the first time Tarantino had used an original score. In accepting Morricone’s Golden Globe for the music in his place, Tarantino called him his favourite composer. “When I say ‘favourite composer,’ I don’t mean movie composer. ... I’m talking about Mozart, I’m talking about Beethoven, I’m talking about Schubert,” Tarantino said. Italy’s head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, in a condolence message to the composer’s family, wrote: “Both a refined and popular musician, he left a deep footprint on the musical history of the second half of the 1900s.” Morricone’s sound tracks, Mattarella said, “contributed greatly to spreading and reinforcing the prestige of Italy in the world.” Morricone’s style was sparse, made of memorable tunes and unusual instruments and arrangements, and often stirred deep emotions. His music punctuated the long silences typical of the Spaghetti Westerns, with the characters locked in close-ups, staring at each other and waiting for their next moves. The coyote howl, harmonicas and eerie whistling of “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” became Morricone’s trademark and one of the most easily recognizable soundtracks in cinema. Minutes before handing Morricone the Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Eastwood recalled hearing for the first time the score of “A Fistful of Dollars” and thinking: “What actor wouldn’t want to ride into town with that kind of music playing behind him?” It was a night to remember for Morricone, who had been nominated for Oscars five times (“The Hateful Eight” was his sixth) but until then had never won. Born in Rome on Nov. 10, 1928, Morricone was the oldest of the five children. His father was a trumpet player. After studying trumpet and composition at the Conservatory of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in the Italian capital, he started working as a trumpeter and then as an arranger for record companies. “I started working on very easy kinds of music pieces for the radio, for television and then for the theatre, and then little by little I started to compose the film scores,” he told the AP in 2016. In 1961 he wrote his first score for a movie, a bittersweet comedy set in the final moments of Fascism called “Il Federale” (known in English as “The Fascist”). That decade also saw Morricone co-operate with Pontecorvo, first on “The Battle of Algiers,” the black-and-white classic depicting the Algerian uprising against the French; and later on “Queimada,” a tale of colonialism starring Marlon Brando. Morricone received his first Oscar nomination for original score with “Days Of Heaven,” a 1978 movie by U.S. director Terence Malick. Beside “The Hateful Eight,” the others were for “The Mission” (1986), “The Untouchables” (1987), “Bugsy” (1991) and “Malena” (2000). Shortly before his lifetime Oscar, Morricone joked that he would have been happy without the coveted statuette, saying “I would have remained in the company of illustrious non-winners.” But he also made no secret that he thought “The Mission,” with its memorably sweet theme of “Gabriel’s Oboe,” deserved the Academy Award. That year, he lost to Herbie Hancock’s “Round Midnight.” Morricone had recently composed music to be performed in Genoa’s Carlo Felice Theater later this summer in honour of the 43 victims of that city’s 2018 Morandi Bridge collapse, Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci said. The music will be performed on the eve of a ceremony inaugurating the bridge’s replacement, the mayor said. Highly versatile, Morricone also orchestrated Italian pop tunes that include enduring classics, like one version of an eternal summer hit, “Sapore di Sale” (“Taste of Salt”), which was written by famed Italian troubadour Gino Paoli. Another renowned maestro, Riccardo Muti, cited his “friendship and admiration? for Morricone. Muti on Monday recalled that when he directed the composer’s piece “Voci dal Silenzio” (Voices from the Silence” ) the work elicited “true emotion” from the audience, both in Chicago, where Muti directs the symphony orchestra, as well as during a performance in Ravenna, Italy. Muti called Morricone an “extraordinary” composer both for films and in classical music. Asked by Italian state TV a few years ago if there was one director he would have liked to have worked with but didn’t, Morricone said Stanley Kubrick had asked him to work on “A Clockwork Orange.” But that collaboration didn’t happen because of a commitment to Leone, Morricone recalled. Morricone is survived by his wife Maria Travia, whom he cited when accepting his 2016 Oscar. Married in 1956, the couple had four children, Marco, Alessandra, Andrea and Giovanni. ___ Biographical material for this report was contributed by former AP correspondent Alessandra Rizzo."

As in other journeys toward recognition, equality and freedom to be, the world has come far, and not far enough. And as always, there are arguments about which way to go. June may be over. But television goes on, and we would like to propose some recent relevant series to keep the party going. One caveat: Not all that follows constitutes a party. ‘Pose-a-Thon’ Mostly a party is the isolation-shot “Pose-a-Thon,” a fundraising special featuring the cast and creators from the FX ballroom drama “Pose” that dropped on the eve of the Stonewall anniversary weekend. Offering songs and stories and testimonials, with a brief history of Stonewall from showrunner Steven Canals, the show makes a point of declaring that the “queer liberation movement was begun by black and brown trans women,” the very people at the heart of “Pose.” ‘Visible: Out on Television’ TV has indeed made progress in the intervening years, if stumbling along the way. Last year brought a same-sex marriage on the PBS cartoon “Arthur,” while the May series finale of Netflix’s “She-Ra and the Princess of Power” made explicit what fans already understood, that it was a long arc lesbian love story. The five-part documentary “Visible: Out on Television,” which premiered on Apple TV Plus in March, reaches back to the earliest days of the medium and gives a pretty thorough account of how LGBTQ people have been portrayed and employed across the decades — from invisibility to subjects of (invariably misguided) analysis, to objects of censure and pity and low comedy, to fodder for concerned social comment and big drama. A running theme of “Visible” is that we should look for ourselves reflected in popular culture, how what we find or fail to find changes us and how in the absence of real representation, we look for what we can adapt and use. LGBTQ characters have moved from guest shots to supporting parts to central roles — to being played, in the bargain, by performers whose identity matches the character’s — as queerness has become something not always worth comment in and of itself. This too raises issues in a still imperfect world — as Times TV editor Matt Brennan pointed out in his piece on the series, the arc toward justice will require more bending. ‘Disclosure’ “Visible” pairs well with (and overlaps) “Disclosure,” a Netflix documentary specifically about trans actors and images, directed by Sam Feder and narrated and featuring “Orange Is the New Black” superstar Laverne Cox. Its view is less historical — though it supplies ample context, back to silent film — than it is concerned with the present and immediate future. Autobiographical, philosophical and political at heart, “Visible” and its contributors are erudite, articulate and disinclined to simplify. ‘Welcome to Chechnya’ HBO has put up a pair of documentaries that demonstrate in different ways the effects of homophobia. The just-premiered, ironically titled “Welcome to Chechnya” is an on-the-ground documentary shot in 2017, when authorities in the Russian Federation republic waged war on its LGBTQ population. They carried out what has been described as a “purge” — allegedly making arrests, torturing citizens to name other citizens, encouraging “honour” killings and generally trying to will difference out of existence. It feels shockingly medieval. The film, directed by David France, focuses on a group of underground activists smuggling refugees through halfway houses and out of Russia to countries willing to take them. It has all the elements of a classic escape film and is often difficult to watch, both for the subject matter and cinematic tension. But it is not without hope. ‘Bully. Coward. Victim. The Story of Roy Cohn’ Seven minutes into the first episode of “Visible,” legal attack dog Roy Cohn turns up next to U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy at the televised Army-McCarthy hearings, which, among other things, targeted LGBTQ people as security risks during the so-called Lavender Scare. Broadcast to an audience of some 80 million over its run, the hearings introduced the fact of homosexuality to television and, one would suppose, to much of America. Cohn is never heard from, or, for that matter, talked about, in “Visible,” but HBO’s excellent “Bully. Coward. Victim. The Story of Roy Cohn” discusses him at feature length. The film takes its title from a panel in the AIDS memorial quilt that director Ivy Meeropol and her father happened upon. It was a moment of particular significance for them, as Meeropol is the granddaughter of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, whom Cohn helped send to the electric chair; he also was, significantly, a closeted gay man, who would die of AIDS complications. A high-living social climber who made it a point of honour to pay as few bills as possible, and no taxes, Cohn was a mentor to Donald Trump, if that word may be used in such a negative context, and an attorney for various organized crime figures. Cohn died in 1986, and Meeropol’s film offers a picture of a gone world — a time when gay culture was influencing the mainstream, without the mainstream quite recognizing that fact. (Cohn was a regular in gay-friendly Provincetown, Mass., and at Studio 54.) Given the Rosenberg connection, “The Story of Roy Cohn” is remarkably even-handed, nearly sympathetic and more than a little sad. Cohn may have been a villain, but he was a victim not only of HIV but also of his generation. In hiding his sexuality, even as he was dying, his case was little different from that of actor Rock Hudson, who died of AIDS complications a year before Cohn. Both were 59. ‘Hollywood’/‘Now Apocalypse’ A fictionalized young Hudson, played by Jake Picking, is a central character in Ryan Murphy’s Netflix miniseries “Hollywood.” It’s an alternative-history postwar fantasy in which fear of a gay Hollywood is overcome as early as 1947, giving Rock the happy beginning, and we assume the ending life denied him — or he denied himself in life. It is a weird mess of a show that works best taken not quite as seriously as it wants to be. But it works as a kind of camp art film — something along the lines of Gregg Araki’s exuberant, future-camp, polysexual, porn-adjacent sci-fi farce “Now Apocalypse,” a Hollywood fable of a different sort. Starz sent it into the world last year. But the glossy, madcap first season is still available to stream, and worth seeking out. ‘A Secret Love’ For a lovely documentary take on the theme, see “A Secret Love,” which debuted on Netflix in April. It tells the story of Pat Henschel and Terry Donahue, a lesbian couple who didn’t reveal the nature of their relationship until they were in their 80s. Made by a family member, Chris Bolan, it’s moving not only for its somewhat reluctant, matter of fact intimacy but also for its sweep. The film takes in their younger lives with photos and home movies that capture a full domestic, romantic and social life in a time when exposure might mean ruin, even imprisonment. That Donahue was a member of the all-American Girls Professional Baseball League, the one pictured in “A League of Their Own,” is a historical bonus."

He was 67. The news was confirmed by his friend, actress Liliana Greenfield-Sanders, and others on social media. “He was the funniest person on the planet,” she wrote. “I will miss him terribly.” The Los Angeles native was born in 1952 and graduated from the American Film Institute in 1975. After working with Anne Bancroft on two projects at AFI, he was introduced to her husband, Mel Brooks, and became his assistant on the 1977 film “High Anxiety.” Cornfeld went on to work with the couple on several more projects and got his first executive producing credit on Brooks’ 1980 film “The Elephant Man.” In the early days of his career, he produced “National Lampoon’s European Vacation” (1985), David Cronenberg’s “The Fly” (1986), Steven Soderbergh’s “Kafka” (1991) and Guillermo Del Toro’s “Mimic” (1997). He also had bit parts in several movies including “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” in which he played the Pirate King of Captain Hook Fish ’n’ Chips. In 1999 he teamed with Stiller to launch Red Hour Films, under which they enjoyed success with the comedies “Zoolander” (2001), “Duplex” (2003), “Starsky & Hutch” (2004), “Dodgeball” (2004), “Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny” (2006), “Blades of Glory” (2007) and “Tropic Thunder” (2008), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Robert Downey Jr. and won best comedy at the Broadcast Critics Film Awards and the Hollywood Film Awards. “A really great person left the planet today,” Stiller said on Twitter. “Stuart Cornfeld ... was my friend, producing partner and creative confidant. He knew movies, made movies and loved movies. World = less better without him.” Toward the end of his career, Cornfeld produced Jack Black’s 2017 film “The Polka King” and did some work in television. He was awarded the Franklin J.

ScottThe New York Times'],"Fri., July 3, 2020","The opening scenes of the filmed version of the Broadway musical “Hamilton,” which started streaming on Disney Plus on Friday, pull you back in time to two distinct periods.  The people onstage, in their breeches and brass-buttoned coats, belong to the New York of 1776. That is when a 19-year-old freshly arrived from the Caribbean — the “bastard, immigrant, son of a whore” who shares his name with the show — makes his move and takes his shot, joining up with a squad of anti-British revolutionaries and eventually finding his way to George Washington’s right hand and the front of the $10 bill. But this Hamilton, played with relentless energy and sly charm by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the music, book and lyrics, also belongs to the New York of 2016. Filmed (by the show’s director, Thomas Kail, and cinematographer Declan Quinn) in front of a live audience at the Richard Rodgers Theater in June of that year, the movie, while not strictly speaking a documentary, is nonetheless a document of its moment. It evokes a swirl of ideas, debates, dreams and assumptions that can feel, in the present moment, as elusive as the intrigue and ideological sparring of the late 1700s. “Hamilton” may be the supreme artistic expression of an Obama-era ideal of progressive, multicultural patriotism. Casting Black and Latino actors as the Founding Fathers and their allies was much more than a gesture of inclusiveness. The show’s argument, woven through songs that brilliantly synthesized hip hop, show tunes and every flavour of pop, was that American history is an open book. Any of us should be able to write ourselves into it. Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the Treasury and an architect of the U.S. banking system, was Miranda’s chosen embodiment of this belief: an outsider with no money and scant connections who propelled himself into the centre of the national narrative through sheer brains, talent and drive. Miranda shares some of his hero’s ambition and intelligence, and turns Hamilton into an avatar of modern American aspiration. “Hamilton” is a brilliant feat of historical imagination, which isn’t the same as a history lesson. Miranda used Ron Chernow’s dad-lit doorstop the way Shakespeare drew on Holinshed’s Chronicles — as a treasure trove of character, anecdote and dramatic raw material. One of the marvels of the show is the way it brings long-dead, legend-shrouded people to vivid and sympathetic life. The close-ups and camera movements in this version enhance the charisma of the performers, adding a dimension of intimacy that compensates for the lost electricity of the live theatrical experience. The glib, dandyish Thomas Jefferson (Daveed Diggs) is a perfect foil for Hamilton: his rival, his intellectual equal and his sometimes reluctant partner in the construction of a new political order. The duplicitous Aaron Burr (Leslie Odom Jr.) may be the most Shakespearean figure in the pageant, a gifted man tormented and ultimately undone by his failure to make himself matter. Not that public affairs are the only forces that move “Hamilton.” I haven’t forgotten the Schuyler sisters, who have some of the best numbers and who somewhat undermine the patriarchal, great-man tendencies inherent in this kind of undertaking. Angelica Schuyler (the magnificent Renée Elise Goldsberry), the oldest of the three sisters, is a freethinker and a feminist constrained by the narrowness of the options available to women of her time and class. Her sister Eliza (Phillipa Soo), who marries Alexander, is saved from being reduced to a passive, suffering figure by the emotional richness of her songs. Still, the personal and the political don’t entirely balance. The biographical details are necessary to the structure and texture of the show, but it is fuelled by cabinet debates and pamphlet wars, by high rhetoric and backroom dealing, by the glory and complexity of self-government. “Hamilton” is motivated, above all, by a faith in the self-correcting potential of the American experiment, by the old and noble idea that a usable past — and therefore a more perfect future — can be fashioned from a record that bristles with violence, injustice and contradiction. The optimism of this vision, filtered through a sensibility as generous as Miranda’s, is inspiring. It is also heartbreaking. One lesson that the past few years should have taught — or reconfirmed — is that there aren’t any good old days. We can’t go back to 1789 or 2016 or any other year to escape from the failures that plague us now. This four-year-old performance of “Hamilton,” viewed without nostalgia, feels more vital, more challenging than ever."
34,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/entertainment/movies/2020/07/03/unsolved-mysteries-returns-because-2020-isnt-scary-enough.html,"‘Unsolved Mysteries’ returns, because 2020 isn’t scary enough",['Alexis SoloskiThe New York Times'],"Fri., July 3, 2020","“Unsolved Mysteries,” the alternately chilling and far-out docuseries that returned to TV this week, began with a solved one. In the fall of 1982, William Catterson, a New Jersey father of two, failed to return home from his fast-food job. His car was found, abandoned. A chocolate cake, an anniversary present for his wife, still rested on the passenger seat. Two years later, writer and producer Terry Dunn Meurer included his case in an HBO documentary: “Missing Persons: Four True Stories.” Catterson, who had faked his own disappearance, saw it. He turned himself in to police, then reunited with his family. “And I was like, ‘Wow, that’s interesting,’” Meurer said. She and her producing partner, John Cosgrove, began to imagine a series that would not only televise have-you-seen-this-person enigmas and criminological riddles but maybe also crack them, too. “Unsolved Mysteries” debuted on NBC in 1988 as part of a late-’80s tabloid TV boom and endured for decades on various networks and cable channels. It had murders and missing persons. Also ghosts, Bigfoot and assorted UFOs. A cadaverous Robert Stack hosted. Eerie theme music gave even hardened viewers the heebie-jeebies. A pick-and-mix format alternated melodramatic crime stories and supernatural thrillers, arguably presaging both pulpy newsmagazines like “Dateline” and paranoid dramas like “The X-Files.” Now Netflix has brought it back. The new “Unsolved Mysteries,” which reunites much of the original creative team, debuted Wednesday with a six-episode batch, to be followed by at least six more instalments later this year. It arrives in an America it anticipated: a crime-obsessed, conspiracy-minded nation with increasingly subjective notions about truth. The format has changed, but the blend of fact and folklore remains. It is a combination that risks trivializing actual crimes by juxtaposing them with wilder content and legitimizing the uncanny through proximity to fact. Not that the creators see it that way. “We like the mix,” Meurer said brightly. “We’ve always thought of ourselves as a mystery show, not as a true-crime show.” From the beginning, competing impulses powered “Unsolved Mysteries”: a crusading compulsion to seek justice and a market-driven need to entertain. The show leaned heavily on reliable tabloid conventions — lost loves, missing heirs, unexplained deaths, medical mysteries — and many of the segments varied first-person interviews with best-guess re-enactments, some of them lurid. Paranormal cases and alternate histories made the counterfactual (a conspiracy theory about Martin Luther King Jr.’s death, Bigfoot) into just another puzzle. “We just came up with every single type of mystery that we could think of: UFO, paranormal, ghost stories, miracles, past lives, psychics,” Meurer said. “We just mixed it all in with the crime.” On NBC, “Unsolved Mysteries” began with a disclaimer: “This program is about unsolved mysteries. Whenever possible, the actual family members and police officials have participated in recreating the events. What you are about to see is not a news broadcast.” So it was not news. Not exactly. But as crowdsourced detection, the series worked. In the ’80s and ’90s, as an episode aired, viewer tips would pour into the show’s call centre. Of the solvable mysteries — a missing child, say, or unidentified remains — the show counts more than 260 as resolved, a clearance rate of about 34 per cent. (“Bigfoot isn’t necessarily solvable,” Meurer said.) Some of those solutions came via viewer tips. After a Friday night broadcast in 1988 about fugitives Missy Munday and Jerry Strickland, a flood of calls had already led to their arrest by Saturday morning. After nine seasons on NBC, the show moved to CBS, then to Lifetime in an attenuated form, then to Spike, which repackaged old episodes and added Dennis Farina as a tan, tough-guy narrator. The Spike stint ended in 2010, but “Unsolved Mysteries” did not disappear. Its website and cold case forums remained open. Old episodes popped up, unofficially and then officially, on YouTube. Amazon began streaming them in 2017. Meurer never gave up on a revival. “There’s always mysteries that need to be solved,” she said. When the hit Netflix drama “Stranger Things” premiered in 2016, she noticed tweets and Facebook posts comparing that scripted series, which is set in the ’80s and goes big on the paranormal, to “Unsolved Mysteries.” So she brought a pitch to its producers at 21 Laps Entertainment. Shawn Levy, who founded 21 Laps, had watched the original “Unsolved Mysteries” in college, admiring the way it meshed genre mystery with character-driven story. “There’s a finite number of true iconic brands in the world, especially in the world of storytelling,” he said. “‘Unsolved Mysteries’ is a true icon.” (He also called it “the Holy Grail of IP.”) Levy, whose company has a deal with Netflix, came on as an executive producer, as did Josh Barry, president of 21 Laps. Levy wanted to honour what he called the “DNA” of the original show, though longtime viewers will immediately recognize changes. Feeling that Stack, who died in 2003, was irreplaceable, producers omitted a host. Gone, too, is the party-platter format of the ’80s and ’90s, in which calamity followed calamity, separated only by commercial breaks. Now each episode, which runs 50 minutes, give or take, centres on a single mystery. There are no commercials. These episodes — three unexplained deaths, one missing person, one wanted man, one paranormal phenomenon — move closer to traditional documentary, with fewer re-enactments and a greater emphasis on interviews and archival sources. The show assumes a somewhat more sophisticated viewer with a far longer attention span. One episode — a family annihilation chiller — is presented almost entirely in French, with English subtitles. And the producers hope that a platform like Netflix, with its global reach and its more than 180 million subscribers, many of them now homebound, may lead to more solutions. “The reach is so wide,” said Marcus A. Clarke, who directed several episodes of the new version. That reach prodded Angel Rivera to participate in the first episode, “Mystery on the Rooftop.” In 2006, his brother, Rey Rivera, went missing. His body was found a week later in the conference room of a Baltimore hotel. A murder or a suicide? The medical examiner could not say. “It’s not something that I ever readily shared with anyone,” Angel Rivera said. But he trusted the producers and described the interviews that Clarke had conducted as therapeutic. “There was a sense of peace doing it,” he said. And the show, he believes, might prompt someone to come forward with information. “We’ll get it out to more ears and eyes than we could ever possibly imagined,” he said. “For my parents, even for me, there’s that closure that we’re all looking for.” Rivera did not mind that the same viewers who will scrutinize his brother’s death can also watch “Berkshires UFO,” an episode about close encounters in the Berkshire mountains in 1969. “I think it falls in line with what the brand is about,” he said. In 2020, when politicians knowingly circulate alternative facts and conspiracy theories trend on TikTok, what does it mean for that brand to take a flexible approach to observable reality? “Unsolved Mysteries” did not create this fungible, disingenuous moment. But a show that puts aliens on the same epistemological footing as a murdered family does meet it. This is not necessarily an act of bad faith — Meurer absolutely believes in the paranormal. “I’ve always felt that way, my whole life,” she said. And Clarke, who directed “Berkshires,” is a UFO enthusiast. He mentioned the Times’ reporting on the Pentagon’s recent release of three videos, filmed by Navy pilots, that show unidentified aerial phenomena. “If at this point people don’t believe or understand that these things are real, they are in denial,” he said. Levy, who described himself as “slightly to the skeptical end of that sliding scale,” enjoyed “Berkshires UFO.” But when pushed, he said he felt less certain about the show’s accommodating approach to the supernatural. “That is something that needs to be considered moving forward,” he said. Another potential problem, for viewers if not necessarily the producers, is the show’s relationship with law enforcement. Cops were not necessarily the series’ heroes. After all, if a case made its way to “Unsolved Mysteries,” police had probably failed in some way. But agencies have historically suggested mysteries to the show’s producers and sent officers to vet tips. Like the recently cancelled “Cops,” the series makes an implicit argument for law and order with its envisioning of a dangerous, anarchic world. “We’ve always had a great reputation with law enforcement,” Meurer said. Still, an episode in this new series, “No Ride Home,” explores a botched police investigation into what may have been a racially motivated crime. In 2004, Alonzo Brooks, a young Black man, disappeared after attending a party. After a police search failed, a search led by friends and family located his body. A cause of death was not determined. In June, spurred by inquiries from “Unsolved Mysteries,” the FBI reopened his case, offering a $100,000 (U.S.) reward. “We’ve been seeing a lot of people being kind of brought to justice from old cases and this is one that really deserves it,” Clarke said. “The family deserves it.” Cynthia Bowles, a longtime story producer, thinks that the Brooks case could be solved. She also feels hopeful about the murder of Patrice Endres (the subject of the episode “13 Minutes”) and the disappearance of Lena Chapin (“Missing Witness”). “They could all shake loose,” she said. Ethical complications will not matter so much if the right tips come. If Brooks’ family — or Rivera’s or Endres’ or Chapin’s — gets answers, who will care about wiggly truth value or an outlook that sees the world through a camera lens, darkly? “‘Unsolved Mysteries’ has always represented hope,” Meurer said. “That’s why we do the show: the hope is that we’re going to solve these cases. “To me,” she added, “that mitigates the darkness.”"

A body authorities believe to be that of Rivera was found Monday morning in the lake after a days-long search, said Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub. Rivera appeared in all six seasons of “Glee,” elevating ensemble numbers with effortless harmonies and riffs while commanding a sweeping range as a soloist. As an actor, she delivered one of the show’s most compelling character arcs, transforming Santana from a textbook popular girl into a complex young woman figuring out her sexuality and coming into her own as a performer. Here’s a sampling of Rivera’s greatest “Glee” performances, from Amy Winehouse’s “Valerie” to Taylor Swift’s “Mine.” ‘The Boy Is Mine’ (season 1, episode 18) “Laryngitis” is one of the first “Glee” episodes to showcase Santana’s vocal talents, featuring one of multiple knockout duets she shared with Amber Riley’s Mercedes. While competing for Puck’s (Mark Salling) affection, the pair harmonize on a cover of Brandy and Monica’s “The Boy Is Mine.” ‘River Deep, Mountain High’ (season 2, episode 4) In “Duets,” Santana makes the strategic decision to partner with Mercedes for the glee club’s duet competition — reuniting the dynamic duo for a powerful cover of Ike & Tina Turner’s “River Deep, Mountain High.” Though they don’t end up winning, the pair rock the rehearsal room with high energy and sharp harmonies. ‘Valerie’ (season 2, episode 9) “Special Education” sees Rachel (Lea Michele) take a back seat at the Western Ohio Sectional Championship show choir competition, giving other talented members of New Directions, including Santana, a chance to shine. Onstage, Santana leads the group in an upbeat rendition of Winehouse’s “Valerie,” which secures them a spot at the upcoming regional competition. ‘Back to Black’ (season 2, episode 21) In “Funeral,” Mr. Schuester (Matthew Morrison) holds auditions for solo parts ahead of the national show choir competition, and Santana opts to sing Winehouse’s “Back to Black.” Despite applauding Santana for her smooth, stylized performance, Schuester ultimately decides that no one will be featured as a soloist for nationals. ‘America’ (season 3, episode 5) “The First Time” sees Santana lead a dazzling ensemble performance of “America” as Anita in McKinley High’s production of “West Side Story.” The number begins and ends with Santana centre stage, dancing and singing circles around her castmates in a stunning red dress. ‘Rumour Has It’ / ‘Someone Like You’ (season 3, episode 6) In “Mash Off,” Mercedes and Santana lead the all-female Troubletones in a seamless mash-up of Adele’s “Rumour Has It” and “Someone Like You.” The performance also sees Santana in a rare moment of vulnerability after she has just been outed as a lesbian. ‘Smooth Criminal’ (season 3, episode 11) In the show’s Michael Jackson-themed episode, New Directions’ Santana faces off against the Warblers’ Sebastian (Grant Gustin) for an intense duet of “Smooth Criminal.” She challenges Sebastian after the Warblers attack their former choir-mate, Blaine (Darren Criss), during a parking-lot showdown of “Bad” (which also features impressive solo work by Santana). At the end of their heated duet, Santana declares, “I was better.” Yep. ‘Mine’ (season 4, episode 4) “The Break-Up” sees Santana return to McKinley High to visit her girlfriend, Brittany. She later serenades Brittany with an intimate, tearful cover of Swift’s “Mine” before suggesting that they take a break from their relationship. ‘Cold Hearted’ (season 4, episode 16) In “Feud,” Santana confronts Rachel’s love interest, Brody (Dean Geyer), with a dynamic performance of “Cold Hearted” closely mirroring Paula Abdul’s original music video. Santana leads the dance-heavy number with the help of some students from the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts. ‘Don’t Rain on My Parade’ (season 5, episode 9) “Frenemies” is the second “Glee” episode to feature Barbra Streisand’s “Don’t Rain on My Parade” from “Funny Girl.” The first was season 1’s “Sectionals,” which sees Rachel (Lea Michele) deliver a show-stopping performance of the tune during a choir competition. In the fifth season, Santana stuns Rachel with an effortless performance of the same song that rivals her own while unexpectedly auditioning to be Rachel’s understudy in a Broadway revival of “Funny Girl.”"

The broadcast journalist announced the news in a video on his social-media accounts, calling his two years on the TV program “an incredible time” and praising the crew and co-host Dina Pugliese. Neither he nor Citytv gave a reason for his departure. Petersen only said he’s “done for now” and “taking a little break.” A statement on Petersen’s departure from a Citytv representative said they “are always striving to best serve” their audiences “and deliver a great morning experience to ‘Breakfast Television’ viewers.” Charmaine Khan, senior manager of communications for Citytv, said they thank Petersen “for his dedication and significant contribution to ‘BT’ and CityNews” and wish him “continued success.” Khan said there are no immediate plans to replace Petersen, who joined the show in July 2018. He had replaced the role vacated by Kevin Frankish on the show, after working as a news reporter and anchor. “All good things must come to an end,” Petersen wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Won’t miss waking up at 3:30. Will miss our amazing viewers and crew.” In his video message, Petersen noted he’s “not done yet.” But for now, he plans “to sleep in for a little while,” do some sailing and hang out with his son."

But critics who expected an apology from the conservative cable provocateur for the out-of-office behaviour of Blake Neff, who worked on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” since January 2017, did not get one. He even delivered a parting shot at them. “What Blake wrote anonymously was wrong,” Carlson said Monday on his program, reading from a statement. “We don’t endorse those words, they have no connection to the show. It is wrong to attack people for qualities they cannot control. In this country we judge people for what they do, not for how they were born. We often say that because we mean it. We’ll continue to defend that principle often alone among national news programs because it is essential ... Blake fell short of that standard and he has paid a very heavy price for it.” Neff had written racist and sexist comments under a pseudonym on the message board AutoAdmit. He resigned Friday after a CNN report revealed his postings on the site for law school students that bills itself as a forum for “supporters of the marketplace of ideas and freedom of expression.” Neff shared racist and bigoted opinions on Black and Asian people, the Mormon church and immigrants. Still, Carlson had harsh words for his detractors whom he accused of revelling in Neff’s departure. “We are all human,” he said. “When we pretend we are holy, we are lying. When we pose as blameless in order to hurt other people we are committing the gravest sin of all and we will be punished for it. There is no question.” A former reporter at the Daily Caller, the conservative news site co-founded by Carlson, Neff also created multiple discussion threads where he mocked women he was friendly with on social media for sharing details about their personal lives, and engaged with posts containing racist vitriol. Neff was part of a small group of writers who help Carlson craft the commentaries he presents throughout his nightly program, which in recent months has been the most-watched program in cable news, averaging more than 4 million viewers a night. Some nights, in the current fragmented TV landscape, “Tucker Carlson Tonight” is the most watched program in all of television. Carlson is among the Fox News hosts who is regularly watched by President Donald Trump. There has even been speculation by political columnists that Carlson would be a viable Republican presidential candidate in 2024 who would carry Trump’s message of anti-immigration nationalism and economic populism. But Carlson, who first joined Fox News in 2016, has been harshly criticized for remarks he has made regarding immigrants and race. He recently scared off advertisers, including T-Mobile, Papa John’s and Walt Disney Co., from his program with a commentary in which he said the Black Lives Matters movement “may be a lot of things, this moment we’re living through, but it is definitely not about Black lives. Remember that when they come for you, and at this rate, they will.” Fox News issued a clarification of the remarks, saying the “they” referred to Democratic politicians and not Black people. Fox News hosts rarely apologize when faced with a public backlash over their programs. But the Neff comments prompted a rare rebuke from senior Fox News executives. In a statement to staff Saturday, Fox News Chief Executive Suzanne Scott and Fox News Media President and Executive Editor Jay Wallace condemned Neff’s remarks, calling them “horrendous and deeply offensive.” “We want to make abundantly clear that Fox News Media strongly condemns this horrific racist, misogynistic and homophobic behaviour,” they said in a statement. “Neff’s abhorrent conduct was never divulged to the show until Friday, at which point we swiftly accepted his resignation. Make no mistake, actions such as his cannot and will not be tolerated at any time in any part of our workforce.” Media Matters, a liberal media watchdog group that has long pressured advertisers to pull their commercials from Fox News programming, said Neff’s comments were not far from the rhetoric that showed up on “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” “His day job was writing a somewhat more sophisticated version of his online posts for Carlson’s show,” Media Matters senior fellow Matt Gertz wrote Monday. “His employment provides a clue as to how some particular obsessions of that community ended up on Fox prime time. But ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ is drenched in the talking points of white nationalists because that’s the way Carlson wants it.” But aside from online outrage, Carlson’s critics have little economic leverage to pressure Fox News to take the host off the air. For most of this year, Carlson’s program has been airing without the support of national brand advertising, as companies have defected over remarks he had made regarding immigrants and race. Nearly all of the commercials on his program are from direct-response advertisers who solicit customers through 1-800 phone numbers or websites, such as MyPillow.com. Such marketers tend to be less particular about the content of the programs where their ads run. MyPillow had four commercials on Monday’s program, which also included ads for Fungi-Nail, a toe nail fungus remover made by Arcadia Consumer Healthcare, and Pray.com, an app that serves up Bible stories. “I am not changing my advertising,” MyPillow Chief Executive Mike Lindell said in a statement. “I make my decisions based on what is best for MyPillow customers and employees.” Lindell is a staunch supporter of President Trump. Carlson has endured the advertiser exodus because he has the backing of Fox Corp. Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch, who picked the host to replace Bill O’Reilly in prime time in 2017. O’Reilly was ousted over sexual harassment allegations, for which he and Fox News paid multimillion dollar settlements to keep them from being publicly revealed."

All the pictures were of faces. All the faces were white. That wall was the first thing Kelly Park saw when she stepped through the glass front doors of the Groundlings Theatre & School in L.A. day after day in the late aughts. It celebrated the comedians who had been voted into the main company and earned the honour of being called Groundlings after a rigorous program that could last years. The wall made Park sad, and as a Black administrator at the school, she grew determined to change it. “Imagine being a young Black person walking into this place,” she said. “The wall showed you that you can’t be that.” Park resigned from the company in 2010, the wall of white faces staring silently forward as she left. From 2006 until 2016, not one member of the Groundlings’ main company was a person of colour. There is finite room in the top ranks of L.A.’s leading improv and sketch comedy groups, and the performers selected to breathe the rarefied air have long been white. This was the painful sentiment echoed again and again in interviews with 14 people of colour — past and present comedians, teachers, students and administrators at Upright Citizens Brigade and the Groundlings, prestigious comedy schools and theatres that have launched some of the biggest names in film and TV. Critics said the self-perpetuating white power structure fostered by these institutions led to the belittling and marginalizing of diverse voices, racial bias in voting for team members, and lip service to the concept of inclusion while providing little mentorship or paths for advancement to Black, Indigenous or other people of colour. “The reason you take these classes and get involved is because you want to be seen on UCB stages. It could change your struggle immensely, it’s why you do it for free,” said Robert L. Hines, a Black comedian who took classes at UCB from 2015 to 2019, during which time he unsuccessfully auditioned for UCB’s coveted Harold teams performing in marquee slots. “But every time you go it’s always the same white guys at Harold shows.” The difficulties faced by BIPOC comedians in improv and sketch comedy are neither new nor secret. But the nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism that arose after the killing of George Floyd, combined with the coronavirus pandemic and its disproportionate effect on communities of colour, have opened a larger window on these grievances. The concerns are receiving plenty of air, particularly on social media, and for what feels to many like the first time, grievances are being met with action. In early July, a group of current and former performers at the Groundlings sent an open letter to the company listing actions to “create the real systemic change that the theatre needs.” The letter said that when the theatre released a statement in support of Black Lives Matter, BIPOC performers associated with the company felt let down by “a theatre that touts itself as a meritocracy while operating like a country club.” Veteran BIPOC comedians at UCB in June launched an initiative called Project Rethink with the goal of dismantling “systemic oppression of all kinds” at the company. Included in the one-page list of goals and demands sent to management: that the powerful, traditionally white role of artistic director be broken up, that BIPOC and disabled performers must have a seat at the table where administrative decisions are made, and that they be involved in company discussions about seeking non-profit status — part of the company’s restructuring plan prior to the pandemic. “Because of COVID-19, that capitalist hamster wheel has had to stop, and there’s now time to breathe and realize what’s going on, and to make changes,” said “Superstore” actor Colton Dunn, who started working with UCB in New York City in 1999. He was one of the first teachers at the L.A. school in 2005, and he was one of three Black people out of dozens of performers. “So when UCB or Second City or the Groundlings reopen, how do we make sure they do so like phoenixes from the ashes of this old system that is infected with institutional racism?” Chicago-based Second City, which has a branch in L.A., erupted in controversy in June when an open letter from prominent alumni including Chris Redd and Sam Richardson called for an investigation of racism and sexism in the company culture. CEO and co-owner Andrew Alexander resigned June 5, acknowledging a failure to create an anti-racist environment. “There seems to be a pattern in comedy groups in general when it comes to issues of sexism and racism in how theatres are run, how casting is done and who is and isn’t getting favours,” said Geoff Ross, who took his first improv class in 2008 and has been with UCB in L.A. since 2016. Ross, who is Black, said he hopes Project Rethink will effect change, but the pandemic has caused him to reconsider how he invests his time and energy. “Is it wiser to try to get an existing organization to change and function the way you would like it to,” Ross asked, “or is it better to use your energy to carve out your own space?” Project Rethink members said their demands are being taken seriously by UCB, which was founded by Amy Poehler, Matt Walsh, Matt Besser and Ian Roberts in the early 1990s. The fact that the UCB 4, as the founders are known, are all white is not what rankles critics. It’s that a largely white male power structure has remained in place for more than 20 years. The same feeling is prevalent at the Groundlings, founded in 1974 and also an important pipeline for improv and sketch artists cast in shows like “Saturday Night Live.” Famous alumni include Will Ferrell, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig. In solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, the Groundlings posted a commitment to change on its website, including a pledge to expand diversity, outreach and scholarship programs; to be actively anti-racist as an institution; to put more BIPOC performers onstage; and to be more inclusive in its hiring practices. It also launched a “listening committee” to field concerns about racism and sexism in classrooms and on stages. “Comedy institutions have a lot of work to do because the basis of comedy was white straight male humour for so long, and everybody is trying to dig out from under that past,” said Groundlings Managing Director Heather de Michele. She said a lot of positive changes have taken place since the Groundlings instituted its diversity initiative in 2015, and she said the company has awarded more than 600 diversity scholarships totalling more than $175,000. “But I will say we have to do more and we recognize that.” The Groundlings’ 10-year white streak was broken in 2016 by Lyric Lewis. Today she is joined in the main company by two other Black performers, Leonard Robinson and Julian Gant. Members of the main company, still capped at 30, are voted in by other main company members after completing up to 18 months of weekly performances as part of an ensemble student sketch company. Rick Davis, an outside counsel for the Groundlings and a former board member who helped to formulate the diversity initiative, said the changes will take time. The goal, he said, is to have BIPOC performers represented in the Groundlings at the same level that they are represented in the community at large. In L.A. County, for example, that would mean about 49 per cent Latino, 15 per cent Asian, 9 per cent Black and 2 per cent American Indian, Native Alaskan or Native Hawaiian. Critics lament that, despite all the talent that has flowed across the Groundlings stage in three decades, you still could count on two hands the total number of BIPOC performers who have been in the main company — and have a few fingers left over. Robinson said his experience with the Groundlings has been largely positive and that the company is on a path toward meaningful change. Other critics with the Groundlings and UCB echoed his feelings, likening the groups to family and saying they want to encourage better habits and behaviours. The issues faced by these companies, they said, are not the result of villainous and overt racism at the top but rather the manifestation of the institutional racism rooted in American life. “It’s an entertainment industry problem, it’s a state of comedy problem,” Robinson said. “People are in the streets burning buildings down, literally, because it’s a problem with the history of the world — diversity and inclusion.” Robinson’s wife, Roxana Ortega, who is Latina and was a student at the Groundlings from 2003 to 2008, submitted ideas to the listening committee including striving for more transparency in the voting process, hiring a school counsellor or mediator to resolve conflicts, and creating a recruitment committee to diversify the classrooms and the stage. Like Robinson, she said the Groundlings is on a path toward meaningful change. Others, however, question whether institutions hobbled by systemic racism for so long are capable of reform — or worthy of the effort. A number of Black performers recently have built successful homes for themselves, including “A Black Lady Sketch Show” on HBO and “Astronomy Club: The Sketch Show” on Netflix, the latter from a group whose members branched off from UCB. Park, the former Groundlings administrator who also took classes there in the early aughts, called the group “the Whitelings” and said the pain and humiliation she experienced struggling to recruit and retain BIPOC students manifested in the form of general anxiety disorder and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Park said she went to comedy clubs and coffee shops in Inglewood and South L.A. and invited Black performers to come and audition. “Every single one of those Black faces was turned away,” Park said. “The board was four or five white people, and every week I’d go to the board with my concerns, and they were never addressed or talked about.” Park said she resigned after a white teacher mocked her with a racial stereotype in front of his students. That teacher, she said, was put on temporary leave but has since been reinstated and still teaches at the school. A representative for the Groundlings said the incident predates the current administration and encouraged Park to report the incident to the listening committee for further investigation. Critics and management alike agree that the problem facing the institutions, when it comes to adequate representation of BIPOC performers, starts at the bottom with recruitment and retention. Daniel Robbins, who taught at the Groundlings for four years, left in 2017 after sending a letter to the school about implicit bias that he felt was not being addressed. His letter said he could not in good conscience continue to teach BIPOC students “knowing that as they worked their way through the school, it was going to become harder and harder for them,” Robbins said. The problems are not just ideological but also financial. Improv and sketch comedy can be careers of privilege. An eight-week course of classes at UCB costs $450; a series of 12 improv classes at the Groundlings runs $525. Both companies offer diversity scholarships, but BIPOC students said financial barriers are one reason they often find themselves to be the sole performers of colour in a class or on a stage. Being “the only,” as one former student called it, has a particular set of challenges when writing a sketch. A Black writer can’t create a sketch that involves a family member, for example, unless that family member being white is the punch line. Writing your experience, in general, becomes problematic, especially when you are expected to immediately understand and react to white cultural references (think Harry Potter and Wes Anderson). Meanwhile, your own cultural references remain largely misunderstood by white performers. Misty Monroe is a former member of the Groundlings’ Sunday Company, an upper-level group of performers who are being evaluated to become main company members. She said one reason she rarely does improv is because as a Black woman, she constantly found herself reduced to stereotypes based on white prejudice. “You will be labelled a prostitute. You will be labelled ignorant. You will be labelled a criminal. You will be labelled someone who does hair,” Monroe said. “All the experience specific to my Blackness can never be reflected on that stage. I did not find white people having the same limitations that I had.” When you can’t pull from your own life experiences, BIPOC performers said, you won’t go as far in your career. White teachers can compound the problem by having a limited perspective themselves. Jasmine Elist, an Iranian American who spent six years with the Groundlings (and is a former Times employee), said that when she was a member of the Sunday Company, a teacher would give her grief every time she tried to pitch or play a Middle Eastern character. The teacher would say the characters were the same or similar, even though they were different ages and had different physical attributes and vocal cadences. “She reduced and minimized a character to the character’s cultural background, determining that one character from Iran was like any other character from Iran,” Elist recalled in an email, adding that she considered the treatment of some other cast members overtly racist. In January, Elist reported the teacher to managing director De Michele, but Elist was never told how the complaint was handled, only that it had been “taken seriously, and addressed in a timely manner.” The teacher is still at the Groundlings. De Michele said privacy rules prevented her from sharing more information. Elist raised the issue again with the Groundlings listening committee, and she had a Zoom meeting with a fact collector recently hired by the Groundlings. Management said this person will work with outside attorneys to investigate specific concerns and report recommendations for further action. Other performers said they never felt overt discrimination but microaggressions and seemingly small challenges did put them at a disadvantage. Navaris Darson, who teaches diversity workshops and core-track improv classes at the Groundlings, said that when he was a student, he had to drive to Crenshaw to buy his own high-quality wigs while white classmates could save money by sharing wigs. Little things like that add to a larger sense of frustration and go largely unnoticed by white teachers and performers, he said. Darson, who has been involved with the diversity committee since its inception, said he has high hopes that the company is on the right track, and he gets emotional thinking about his love for his fellow performers. “I wouldn’t have a career if it wasn’t for the Groundlings. It’s more than just a job for me. Those people are my family,” Darson said. “I really do trust them to do the right thing.” Doing the right thing, however, can have pitfalls, critics said. A focus on diversity can swiftly become a matter of optics, said UCB writing partners Eileen Soong and Julie Hoang. The Asian American women have been on the same writing team since 2018 and had developed a great writing dynamic and relationship, they said, but they were recently broken up. The reason, they heard: Keeping two Asian women together on a team would be perceived as racist. Soong said race never would have been part of the discussion about two white writers. “It feels like we were broken up to diversify the other teams,” Hoang said. “That just shows there aren’t enough diverse people to begin with.” BIPOC performers must find and champion one another within the community in order to thrive, but mentorship can be lacking. Shaun Diston, who has been with UCB since 2008 and is one of the comedians behind Project Rethink, said BIPOC performers must work five times as hard as other performers to get to the top. Once there, they can get picked up for jobs in Hollywood and move on quickly. (Hollywood, he said, checks in now and again looking for BIPOC talent when it’s trendy to do so.) But the churn means that UCB regularly has a diversity gap, and promising students of colour are sometimes moved up in the ranks before they are ready. “After that well-intentioned move, they end up floundering because there’s no support,” Diston said. “They get spit out in a way that feels like, ‘You don’t value my diversity, you’ve used it, the joy has been crushed out of it.’” The devaluation of BIPOC students as performers can be particularly bad during the audition process, when 20 white people are in a room analyzing a performer who may be traumatized by the unconscious bias and microaggressions of those same people. Diston said he would go to these auditions as a judge and try to voice his opinions, only to be told that it wasn’t the time to talk, or that what he said was wrong. “If my voice isn’t going to be heard, I’m not going to sit here so that you can say there were Black people watching the auditions,” Diston said. The Times repeatedly reached out to UCB Artistic Director Christine Bullen and Academic Director Johnny Meeks for comment. Meeks did not respond, and Bullen said she was no longer qualified to speak on behalf of UCB because her continuing role with the company was undetermined. She said she wholeheartedly supports Project Rethink. In mid-June the UCB 4 issued a statement to company members that as of Aug. 1, the founders will no longer handle day-to-day operations of the school and that once they received non-profit status, they would hand over control of UCB theatres to a new board of “diverse individuals.” It is unclear who these individuals will be, but Project Rethink has plenty of ideas."

Soulpepper Theatre’s “The Brothers Size” took five awards in the general theatre division while “The Mush Hole,” from Kaha:wi Dance Theatre and Young People’s Theatre, took an equal number in the young audiences division. The next biggest winner was the Canadian Opera Company’s “Rusalka,” which took four prizes in the opera division. The awards were handed out by the Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts in an online ceremony. “The Brothers Size,” a play about two Black brothers in the Louisiana bayou by Oscar-winning screenwriter Tarell Alvin McCraney (“Moonlight”), won Outstanding Production, Outstanding Direction for Mumbi Tindyebwa Otu and Outstanding Feature Performance for Daren A. Herbert. It also won for costume design and lighting.

Soulpepper’s “Almighty Voice and His Wife” won for scenic design and “Julius Caesar,” from Groundling Theatre and Crow’s Theatre, for lighting design. “The Mush Hole” is the nickname for the Mohawk Institute Residential School in Brantford, which operated as a boarding school for Indigenous children from 1829 to 1970. The theatre production of that name, based on interviews and writings by survivors, won both Outstanding Production and Outstanding New Play as well as Outstanding Direction for Santee Smith, who also created it. It also took Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble and projection design. The award for individual performance in the young audiences division went to Malindi Ayienga for Young People’s Theatre’s “You and I.” In the musical theatre division, the prizes were shared among six productions, with “Caroline, or Change,” from Musical Stage Company and Obsidian Theatre, and “Ghost Quartet,” from Crow’s Theatre and Eclipse Theatre Company, taking two each. “Caroline” claimed both the performance awards, with Jully Black winning Outstanding Lead in her musical theatre debut and Vanessa Sears taking Outstanding Feature Performance. “Ghost Quartet” won for direction for Marie Farsi and lighting design for Patrick Lavender.

Although an exact date for performances to resume has yet to be determined, Broadway producers are now offering refunds and exchanges for tickets purchased for shows through Jan. 3. “The Broadway experience can be deeply personal but it is also, crucially, communal,” said Thomas Schumacher, chairman of the board of The Broadway League, which represents producers. “The alchemy of 1,000 strangers bonding into a single audience fuelling each performer on stage and behind the scenes will be possible again when Broadway theatres can safely host full houses,” he added. “The safety of our cast, crew, orchestra and audience is our highest priority and we look forward to returning to our stages only when it’s safe to do so.” Broadway theatres abruptly closed on March 12, knocking out all shows — including 16 that were still scheduled to open — and postponing indefinitely the Tony Award schedule. Producers, citing health and city authorities, previously extended the shutdown to June 7 and then again to Sept. 6. In London, producer Cameron Mackintosh has said his company’s West End productions of “Hamilton,” “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Mary Poppins” and “Les Miserables” won’t reopen until 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., has cancelled most previously announced performances and events through the end of 2020, as has the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston. Broadway grossed $1.8 billion (U.S.) last season and attracted a record 15 million people. Producers and labour unions are discussing ways theatres can reopen safely. The latest extension wipes away many shows planned for the fall. Many have just moved to next year, including a revival of “The Music Man” with Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster that was to start rehearsals on June 29 but will now open in May 2021. Shows that were to open this spring have abandoned their plans, including “Hangmen” and a revival of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” A production of “The Minutes” by Tracy Letts and “American Buffalo” by David Mamet will arrive on Broadway in Spring 2021, opening exactly one year after their originally scheduled opening dates."
41,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/entertainment/stage/2020/06/22/canadian-opera-company-calls-off-fall-schedule.html,Canadian Opera Company calls off fall schedule,['Garnet FraserToronto Star'],"Mon., June 22, 2020","The Canadian Opera Company has cancelled all of its in-person performances and events slated for this fall, including “Parsifal” and “The Marriage of Figaro,” due to continued limits on travel and large gatherings in Toronto in the battle with the COVID-19 pandemic. The company’s production of Wagner’s “Parsifal” will be rescheduled for the 2022/23 season. “Marriage of Figaro” is simply cancelled. Also falling victim to the new rules is a popular free noon concert series and other events.  The remainder of the COC’s 2020/21 season is, for now, intended to proceed as planned, with Bizet’s “Carmen,” Verdi’s “La Traviata” and more still scheduled for January through May 2021.  The company’s spring 2020 season was cancelled in March as the pandemic arrived in Canada.  Since then, COC general director Alexander Neef said in Monday’s release, it’s been pondering what its near future could safely be, but “opera gathers talent from all around the world to work together in close quarters, requires an extensive rehearsal schedule, plenty of advance planning and — to remain economically viable — an auditorium full of people, without whom no live performance is complete.  “Taking all of these factors into account, plus the many unknowns around public health guidelines in the fall, this was the only viable course of action to ensure the continued safety of our artists, staff and audiences.” The COC Ensemble Studio will continue to develop Canada’s top young opera artists by working remotely as required. The company says that in recent months its trainers have used digital resources to deliver vocal, diction, language, dramatic and performance kinetics coaching among others. The cancellation of the COC’s first production of “Parsifal” will “come as a disappointment to many,” Neef said. “This production caps a decade-long, community-led effort to stage Wagner’s final work here.” A recently commissioned production of “Fantasma,” by COC composer-in-residence Ian Cusson with libretto by Colleen Murphy and intended for young audiences, will be moved from December to sometime in spring 2021. The company is working to create webinars, interactive programming and other educational material in a digital format. Options for affected ticket-holders range from tax receipts issued for ticket donation, converting ticket value to gift certificate credits that never expires, or full refunds; complete details are listed at coc.ca/FallTickets. Both the COC’s home venue, the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, and the company’s administrative office remain closed to the public until further notice, with full-time staff continuing to work off-site. The COC has created a digital content hub at coc.ca/Hub, home to a “Virtual Choir,” a video chorus that received hundreds of submissions from all over the globe; “Songs of Hope,” an intimate online concert from the COC Ensemble Studio slated to premiere on July 9; and “Opera Makers,” a series of bite-sized video tutorials for young people."
