Expected to hit $1 trillion, the emerging Republican package shows shifting priorities as the pandemic crisis deepens nationwide. Once reluctant to approve more aid, Republicans and the White House now say more is needed. In recent days, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been reaching out to GOP senators ahead of negotiations with Democrats, who already approved a $3 trillion House bill. McConnell, during a visit to a hospital in his home state of Kentucky, said the theme of the upcoming GOP bill will be children and schools, jobs and unemployment, and health care. Congress is returning Monday for two weeks to consider fresh coronavirus relief as the Trump administration has been unable to halt the virus’ deepening spread across the country. Asked at an earlier event Tuesday if he would be attending next month’s Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, Florida, a state with record-setting cases, McConnell said his “current intention“ is to go, but that he would assess closer to the date. While McConnell wanted to hit “pause” after the last big relief package in May, he now hopes to swiftly approve the new one in hopes of staunching the pandemic crisis and economic fallout. Speaking at the White House, President Donald Trump said, “We have to get everything open.“ House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned that, without a comprehensive federal strategy for the country, the devastating virus and its economic toll will only persist. “We can open our economy, we can open our schools, if we test, trace, treat, separate, mask, hygiene and the rest, but we have to make a national decision to do it,” Pelosi said on CNN. Pelosi said she’s “very afraid of where we are now, because of the ignorance in the administration.” She warned that if Congress doesn’t make the investments needed, “we’re going to pay a worse price, worse hit, on the economy.” Central to the GOP proposal is a five-year liability shield that McConnell wants to extend to businesses, hospitals, schools and others to prevent lawsuits from those claiming injuries during the pandemic and economic shutdown and reopening. McConnell acknowledged schools will need more money, especially as they reduce class sizes for social distancing and potentially stagger classroom shifts. Democrats have proposed $100 billion for schools in the House-passed bill. This week, Vice-President Mike Pence assured governors on a private conference call that he was working with congressional leaders on securing more education funds. Some Trump advisers want a robust amount for schools, believing it would be politically popular and give the president a needed campaign boost ahead of the election. “I know they’re going to need help in order to keep the kids safely in schools,” McConnell said. “There’s a cost associated with that.” Republicans initially wanted to end a $600 weekly boost to unemployment insurance that’s set to expire at the end of this month. But McConnell said Tuesday that providing some unemployment insurance is “extremely important” for out-of-work Americans. The new bill will likely reconfigure the bonus, replacing it with a smaller amount. Additionally, Republicans are eyeing a return-to-work stipend for workers to get back on the job and another round of direct payments to Americans modeled on the the $1,200 rebates sent in spring. Republicans are also considering new tax breaks for companies that reconfigure offices and work spaces to protect returning employees from the coronavirus. Unclear is how much money Republicans are willing to provide states and cities pushing the federal government for relief. Also uncertain is what kind of resources McConnell plans to make available for virus testing, which many experts say is central to staunching the virus spread. House Democrats have proposed $75 billion toward a new national testing strategy in their bill. With the federal deficit hitting a historic high in June, Republicans are likely to object to big-ticket spending. McConnell acknowledges the new legislation is expected to run into resistances. Some expect as many as a dozen Republican senators could be opposed. As lawmakers debate what to include in the next COVID-19 bill, a range of interest groups have peppered Congress with requests. In a call Tuesday organized by a coalition of labour and health groups, actress Jane Fonda and other speakers urged lawmakers to include money for personal protective equipment, or PPE, for health care workers, as well as paid sick leave and a mandate for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to impose an emergency health standard for U.S. workplaces. Democrats and advocacy groups have accused the agency of being largely invisible during the pandemic and failing to protect workers at meatpacking plants, health care facilities and other high-risk sites. Instead of an emergency standard, the agency has relied on voluntary guidance that recommends companies take various steps to erect physical barriers, enforce social distancing and install more hand-sanitizing stations. The House Democrats’ bill mandates an emergency workplace standard. The lack of action “is disgraceful and an insult to family members” who have lost loved ones, said Jessica Martinez, co-executive director of the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, an advocacy group. Martinez said the next COVID-19 bill must include funds for personal protective equipment, paid sick leave and full medical coverage for essential workers, and the emergency OSHA standard. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report."

Water levels at major rivers were rising Tuesday at around two dozen points in 20 districts. Many new areas in northern, northeastern and central Bangladesh have been affected over last 24 hours, Arifuzzman Bhuiyan, an executive engineer with the Water Development Board, said by phone. Bangladesh has 64 districts. “The situation is worsening,“ he said. “The worst thing is that the floods are getting prolonged this year, which is a bad sign.” Bhuiyan said heavy rainfall and rushing waters from upstream India were the main reasons for the floods in the delta nation of 160 million people, which receives monsoon rains between June and October every year, often leading to flooding. The floods started late last month, and after briefly easing continued to worsen, affecting many new areas, destroying crops and driving people from their homes in several impoverished regions. Bangladesh is crisscrossed by 230 rivers, including 53 shared with India. In the northern district of Kurigram, one of the worst-hit areas, thousands of villagers have moved from their homes to higher ground since the weekend, bringing along their cattle and other belongings, said Mizanur Rahman Soikat, project co-ordinator with the Bidyanondo Foundation, a local charity. The foundation has been distributing both cooked and dry food to the flood-affected villagers, many of whom have lost their crops and livelihood. Soikat said that over the last few weeks, the charity has distributed food to some 135,000 people in Kurigram, while the government’s relief office was also providing food, cash and cattle food. “Over last two days, the situation has deteriorated and many villages went underwater in the district,“ he said by phone. “I have seen thousands taking shelter.” The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement Monday that more than a million Bangladeshis have been marooned by the floods, with the worst of it happening since the weekend. “Thousands of people are expected to leave their homes throughout the beginning of this week to seek shelter in higher ground as the Water Development Board warned that the onrush of water from upstream would further intensify,” the statement said. A.T.M. Akhteruzzman, a relief and rehabilitation officer in the northern district of Rangpur, said about 50,000 people who live along the Teesta River basin have been marooned. “Waters are coming from India, while heavy rainfalls in the region are causing havoc,” he said. “We are trying to do our best to stand by the people, as we have already provided more than 300 tons of rice, cattle food, baby food and a good amount of cash. Our relief operations will continue.“"

Wesley Ira Purkey, convicted of a gruesome 1998 kidnapping and killing, is scheduled for execution Wednesday at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, where Daniel Lewis Lee was put to death Tuesday after his own 11th-hour legal bids failed. Lee, who was convicted of killing an Arkansas family in a 1990s plot to build a whites-only nation, was the first of four condemned men scheduled to die in July and August despite the coronavirus pandemic raging both inside and outside prisons. Purkey, 68, of Lansing, Kansas, would be the second, but his lawyers were still expected to press for a ruling from the Supreme Court on his competency. “This competency issue is a very strong issue on paper,” said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. “The Supreme Court has halted executions on this issue in the past. At a minimum, the question of whether Purkey dies is going to go down to the last minute.” Lee’s own execution went forward a day late. It was scheduled for 4 p.m. Monday, but the Supreme Court only gave the green light in a narrow 5-4 ruling early Tuesday. The issue of Purkey’s mental health arose in the runup to his 2003 trial and when, after the verdict, jurors had to decide whether he should be put to death in the killing of 16-year-old Jennifer Long in Kansas City, Missouri. Prosecutors alleged that he raped and stabbed her, dismembered her with a chainsaw, burned her, then dumped her ashes 200 miles (320 kilometres) away in a septic pond in Kansas. Purkey was separately convicted and sentenced to life in the beating death of 80-year-old Mary Ruth Bales, of Kansas City, Kansas. But the legal questions of whether he was mentally fit to stand trial or to be sentenced to die are different from the question of whether he is mentally fit enough now, in the hours before his scheduled execution, to be put to death. Purkey’s lawyers argue he clearly is not, saying in recent filings that he suffers from advancing Alzheimer’s disease. “He has long accepted responsibility for the crime that put him on death row,” one of this lawyers, Rebecca Woodman, said. “But as his dementia has progressed, he no longer has a rational understanding of why the government plans to execute him.” Purkey believes his planned execution is part of a vast conspiracy involving his own attorneys, Woodman said. In other filings, they describe delusions that people were spraying poison into his room and that drug dealers implanted a device in his chest meant to kill him. While various legal issues in Purkey’s case have been hashed, rehashed and settled by courts over nearly two decades, the issue of mental fitness for execution can only be addressed once a date is set, according to Dunham, who also teaches law school courses on capital punishment. A date was only set last year. “Competency is something that is always in flux,” so judges can only assess it in the weeks or days before a firm execution date, he said. In a landmark 1986 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution prohibits putting someone to death who lacks a reasonable understanding of why he is being executed. It involved the case of Alvin Ford, who was convicted of murder but whose mental health deteriorated behind bars to the point where, according to his lawyer, he believed he was pope. Legal standards as to whether someone has a rational understanding of why an execution is taking place can be complex, Dunham explained. “I could say I was Napoleon,” he said. “But if I say I understand that Napoleon was sentenced to death for a crime and is being executed for it — that could allow the execution to go ahead.“ Purkey’s mental issues go beyond Alzheimer’s, his lawyers have said. They say he was subject to sexual and mental abuse as a child and, at 14, was diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and psychosis. Last week, three mental health organizations urged U.S. Attorney William Barr to stop Purkey’s execution and commute his sentence to life in prison without possibility of parole. The letter — signed by the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Mental Health America and the Treatment Advocacy Center — said that executing mentally ailing individuals like Purkey “constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and does not comport with ‘evolving standards of decency.’” The mother of the teen he killed, Glenda Lamont, told the Kansas City Star last year she planned to attend the execution. “I don’t want to say that I’m happy,” Lamont said. “At the same time, he is a crazy mad man that doesn’t deserve, in my opinion, to be breathing anymore.” The runup to Lee’s execution demonstrated that a lot can still happen before Purkey’s scheduled one. On Monday, hours before Lee was set to be put to death, a U.S. District Court judge put the execution on hold over concerns from death row inmates on how executions were to be carried out, and an appeals court upheld it, before the Supreme Court overturned it early Tuesday. If prison officials get the go-ahead to execute Purkey, he would be put to death by lethal injection, as Lee was, and in the same small room at the Terre Haute prison. ___ Hegeman reported from Wichita, Kansas.

3,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/news/world/us/2020/07/14/trump-signs-bill-executive-order-rebuking-china.html,"Trump signs bill, order rebuking China, and slams Biden","['Zeke Miller, Deb Riechmann And Matthew LeeThe Associated Press']","Tue., July 14, 2020","WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump signed legislation and an executive order on Tuesday that he said will hold China accountable for its oppressive actions against the people of Hong Kong, then quickly shifted his policy speech into a political one, hurling broadsides against Democratic rival Joe Biden. The legislation and order are part of the Trump administration’s stepped-up offensive against China for what he calls the rising Asian superpower’s exploitation of America and its effort to conceal details about the human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus from the world. The almost daily administration attacks on Beijing come as Trump defends his own response to the virus, with cases surging in parts of the United States, and as he works ahead of the election to portray Biden as soft on China. “So Joe Biden and President Obama freely allowed China to pillage our factories, plunder our communities and steal our most precious secrets,” Trump said, adding, “I’ve stopped it largely.” Trump said that as vice-president, Biden advocated for the Paris Agreement addressing climate change; Trump withdrew the U.S. from the accord. “It would have crushed American manufacturers while allowing China to pollute the atmosphere with impunity, yet one more gift from Biden to the Chinese Communist Party,” Trump said. Trump talked up his own tough approach to Beijing, though he spent the early weeks of the pandemic praising Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two nations signed phase one of a trade deal, but since then, relations have soured and Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden that he has no interest in talking to Xi. The legislation Trump signed into law targets police units that have cracked down on Hong Kong protesters as well as Chinese Communist Party officials responsible for imposing a new, strict national security law widely seen as chipping away at Hong Kong’s autonomy. The mandatory sanctions are also required to be imposed on banks that conduct business with the officials. While he signed the bill into law, Trump issued a statement saying the administration would not view as binding certain sections of the law that the White House believes limit a president’s powers to conduct foreign policy. Lawmakers from both parties have urged Trump to take strong action in response to China’s new national security law that erodes the “one country, two systems” framework under which Britain handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997. Hong Kong is considered a special administrative region within China and has its own governing and economic systems. “This law gives my administration powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong’s freedom,” Trump said. “Their freedom has been taken away. Their rights have been taken away, and with it goes Hong Kong in my opinion because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets. A lot of people will be leaving Hong Kong, I suspect.“ The executive order he signed did not appear to go beyond his administration’s previous determinations that Hong Kong is no longer eligible for preferential treatment from the United States. Trump said the order strikes those privileges but, in fact, the administration already has been in the process of eliminating them for nearly two months. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo first made the determination in late May that China’s decision to impose a new national security law in Hong Kong meant the former British territory was no longer a democracy and so was no longer eligible for trade, commercial and other U.S. perks it had enjoyed. Just three days later, when Trump announced the U.S. was withdrawing from the World Health Organization because of Chinese influence, he echoed Pompeo’s determination and instructed his administration to immediately begin eliminating the preferences, which it did. In late June, the administration barred Hong Kong from importing U.S. weapons, saying its purchase of items that have both civilian and military applications would be subject to the same licensing requirements as mainland China. Other actions in the works include suspending an extradition treaty with Hong Kong, something Australia has already done, as well as ending legal co-operation agreements, taxation accords and financial understandings that cover accounting rules for Chinese businesses that work in the U.S. At the same time, the administration has pressed ahead with travel bans for Chinese, Hong Kong and communist party officials the U.S. believes are responsible for curtailing democracy in Hong Kong. The administration also also gone after China by imposing travel bans on officials for repressing minorities in western China and hindering foreigners’ access to Tibet. On Monday, Pompeo announced that the U.S. had decided to reject outright virtually all Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea, a determination that could lead to increased tensions in disputed, critical international shipping lanes. ___ Associated Press writer Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report."

In one interview, Trump seemed taken aback when asked why African Americans are still dying at the hands of police. “And so are white people. So are white people. What a terrible question to ask. So are white people,“ Trump told CBS’s Catherine Herridge. “More white people, by the way. More white people.” There is no national database tracking police-involved shootings. But studies have shown that Black Americans are much more likely to be killed by police, even though more whites — who make up a larger portion of the population — are killed. One study that examined the use of lethal force by law enforcement from 2009 to 2012, for instance, found that while victims were a majority white (52%), they were disproportionately Black (32%) with a fatality rate 2.8 times higher among Blacks than whites. Trump’s comments drew criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union’s Jeffery Robinson, who issued a harshly worded statement saying Trump’s answer “not only ignores the fact that per capita Black and Brown people are disproportionately killed by police, it provides the foundation for the dangerous and unconstitutional police practices that result in the deaths of Black people with regularity. “Trump’s racism is so absolute that he continues to refuse to give even a tacit acknowledgment to the epidemic of police violence against Black people in America,“ Robinson alleged, accusing Trump of ”using the violence and suffering perpetrated against Black communities as a white-supremacist dog whistle ahead of the coming election.” In the interview, Trump also defended the use of the Confederate flag, despite saying in 2015 that he believed the flag belongs in a museum. “All I say is freedom of speech. It’s very simple. My attitude is freedom of speech,“ Trump responded. ”Very simple. Like it, don’t like it, it’s freedom of speech.” Asked whether he understood the flag is a painful symbol to many because it is a reminder of slavery, Trump told CBS that some “people love it,” adding: “And I know people that like the Confederate flag and they’re not thinking about slavery.” Trump has been under fire for his response to the mass anti-racism protests that broke out across the across the nation following the killing of George Floyd in police custody. In the face of demands for racial justice and equality, Trump has instead leaned in on a law-and-order message, painting mostly peaceful protesters as domestic “terrorists” and continuing to stoke divisions. In a second interview with the conservative Townhall Media, Trump defended the white St. Louis couple captured on video brandishing guns as they defended their home during one racial injustice protest. Trump claimed that Mark and Patricia McCloskey “were going to be beat up badly, if they were lucky” and said their house would have been “totally ransacked and probably burned down” had they not been out there. “And now I understand somebody local, they want to prosecute these people. It’s a disgrace,” he said. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson told reporters that he spoke with Trump and U.S. Attorney General William Barr by phone earlier Tuesday and that the president expressed concern that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, a Democrat, may file charges against the couple. “I think the president didn’t like what he was seeing, and the way people are being treated,” Parson said, adding, “I think you’ll see some sort of actions.”"

That is an increase from last week, when officials initially said 26 legislators and 10 others had the highly contagious virus. Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the state health officer, had said the numbers could go up as more people received test results. Dobbs said Tuesday that two people from the Capitol were hospitalized, but he did not say who they are. Mississippi has the largest outbreak of COVID-19 among state legislators in the U.S., according to numbers tracked by The Associated Press. Legislators left the Mississippi Capitol on July 1, after being there through most of June. Some people in the building wore masks and kept distance from others as precautions against spreading the virus, but many did not. It was common to see people leaning in to talk to each other with their faces uncovered. People also crowded into elevators and committee meeting rooms, and legislators also sat shoulder-to-shoulder in the House and Senate. Legislators will need to return to the Capitol at some point to approve a budget for the state Department of Marine Resources and to decide whether to override Republican Gov. Tate Reeves’s veto of parts of the education budget. The state budget year started July 1.

But a top Navy official said it was too soon to say if the 23-year-old ship that is burning on opposite ends will be salvageable. Navy officials were able to inspect four main engineering rooms and found no major damage, and the external structure of the ship appears to be safe, said Rear Adm. Philip Sobeck, the commander of the strike group whose flagship is the USS Bonhomme Richard. But he cautioned at a briefing that there is still “a major fire inside“ being fought by hundreds of sailors who were focusing their efforts on two isolated spots near the stern and the bow of the ship. It was unclear if there were two distinct fires on board or if the area burning near the tail end was simply from the heat of a single large blaze, Sobeck said. It’s also unclear whether the amphibious assault ship that is akin to a mini-aircraft carrier can still be repaired. “We haven’t been inside the ship well enough to be able to get a full picture, and it’s just too early to tell,“ Sobeck said. The fire temperatures had reached up to 1,000 degrees (538 Celsius), causing the mast to collapse and threatening the central control island where the captain operates the vessel. In other good signs of progress, the fire had moved away from the one million gallons (3.8 million litres) of fuel on board, easing the risk of an explosion or spill, though the military was still taking precautions if either worst-case scenario should occur, he said. Helicopters had dumped 1,200 buckets of water on the ship, allowing crews to move further on board to fight the blaze. Tugboats were assisting from the waterline. The 840-foot (255-meter) ship was undergoing maintenance when the fire was first reported Sunday morning in a lower cargo area where seafaring tanks are parked. It appears to have started where cardboard boxes, rags and other maintenance supplies were being stored, Sobeck said. It spread rapidly from the front to the rear of the ship and quickly ballooned into one of the worst Navy shipyard fires in years. It could cost the military an estimated $4 billion to replace the ship. At least 61 people, including 38 sailors and 23 civilians, have been treated for heat exhaustion, smoke inhalation and minor injuries. None were in the hospital Tuesday. Maritime lawyer Rod Sullivan, who served in the Navy, said two separate fires on a ship is highly unusual and could raise questions as to whether arson was involved. “It is very, very difficult for fire to traverse the entire length of ship,“ and then to not cause damage in every compartment, said Sullivan, who has handled fire cases involving everything from large passenger ships to yachts. “Arson has to be considered as a possibility here.” Navy officials said they will conduct a thorough investigation, but they have no indications yet of any foul play. Sobeck said the fire appears to have travelled upward to an open hangar-like area and from there, fueled by oxygen, it raced along the ship’s ventilation and cables, causing it to traverse the ship. Cables and duct work being done as part of the ship’s maintenance fed the fire and later created barriers to sailors trying to fight it, Sobeck said. Also, at least two fire-suppression systems were not able to be used. One was deactivated while the ship was being worked on, and the other was not able to be launched because of an explosion — believed cause by pressure building up when the fire started, Sobeck said. ___ Associated Press writer John Antczak contributed from Los Angeles."

Mike Parson said President Donald Trump is focused on and concerned about the possibility that a white St. Louis couple could face criminal charges for displaying guns as they defended their home during a racial injustice protest. Parson told reporters Tuesday that he had just been on the phone with Trump and U.S. Attorney General William Barr. The phone call came amid reports that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, a Democrat, may file charges against Mark and Patricia McCloskey, both of them lawyers in their 60s. The couple wielded guns on June 28 as protesters marched by their Renaissance palazzo-style mansion on the way to the home of St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson. A police report said the couple heard a loud commotion and saw a large group of people break an iron gate marked with “No Trespassing” and “Private Street” signs. Video showed protesters walking through the gate and it was unclear when it was damaged. The widely viewed video showed Mark McCloskey wielding a long-barrelled gun and Patricia McCloskey standing next to him waving a handgun. The actions of the couple have drawn scorn and ridicule from some, praise and support from others. Gardner’s spokeswoman said Tuesday that the case is still under investigation and no charges have been filed, though authorities executed a search warrant at the mansion late last week. Parson, a Republican and a staunch Trump supporter, is also a former sheriff and state representative who co-authored Missouri’s “castle doctrine” law that justifies the use of deadly force when protecting one’s home. Parson said he told Trump that it’s difficult to remove an elected official from office in Missouri, though he didn’t say if Trump had asked if Gardner could be removed. “I think the president didn’t like what he was seeing, and the way people are being treated,” Parson said. “I think you’ll see some sort of actions.” In an interview Tuesday with Townhall Media, Trump defended the couple, saying “they were going to be beat up badly, if they were lucky” and that their house was going to be ransacked and probably burned. He called talk of prosecuting them a disgrace. It’s unclear what either Trump or Barr could do, but Parson said he expects that both “are going to take a look at it.” Gardner’s spokeswoman, Allison Hawk, said she was unaware of Parson’s comments and declined immediate comment. Gardner issued a statement after the confrontation saying her office was working with police to investigate it. “We must protect the right to peacefully protest, and any attempt to chill it through intimidation or threat of deadly force will not be tolerated,” she said at the time. Gardner became St. Louis’ first-ever Black circuit attorney when she took office after winning election in 2016. Her 3 1/2 years in office have drawn strong support from the Black community, especially for reform efforts aimed at reducing incarceration and stopping the prosecution of low-level crimes such as marijuana possession. But she’s also drawn scorn from others, accusing her of being weak on crime and motivated by politics. In 2018, Gardner charged then-Gov. Eric Greitens with felony invasion of privacy for allegedly taking a compromising photo of a woman during an extra-marital affair. Greitens, a Republican, denied the allegation and the charge was eventually dropped, but he resigned in June that year. St. Louis annually ranks among the nation’s deadliest cities, and 2020 is on pace for one of its deadliest years ever. Parson is planning a special session to address violent crime in St. Louis and Kansas City, and he said Gardner should be focused on crime, too, not the McCloskeys. “That couple had every right to protect their property,” Parson said. Trump “understands the situation in Missouri, he understands the situation in St. Louis, and how out of control it is for a prosecutor to let violent criminals off and not do their job and try to attack law-abiding citizens,“ Parson said. “The president said he would do everything he could within his powers to help with this situation, that he would be taking action to do that. I’m thankful that he’s getting involved in the situation, I’m thankful that he’s going to stand up for people on their legal rights and we’re going to move forward in this state,” Parson said."

The decision was announced at the start of a hearing in a federal lawsuit in Boston brought by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs said federal immigration authorities agreed to pull the July 6 directive and “return to the status quo.” A lawyer representing the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said only that the judge’s characterization was correct. The announcement brings relief to thousands of foreign students who had been at risk of being deported from the country, along with hundreds of universities that were scrambling to reassess their plans for the fall in light of the policy. With the policy rescinded, ICE will revert to a directive from March that suspended typical limits around online education for foreign students. ICE did not immediately comment on the decision. Harvard President Lawrence Bacow called it a “significant victory.” “While the government may attempt to issue a new directive, our legal arguments remain strong and the Court has retained jurisdiction, which would allow us to seek judicial relief immediately to protect our international students should the government again act unlawfully,” Bacow said in a statement. MIT’s president said his institution also stands ready “to protect our students from any further arbitrary policies.” “This case also made abundantly clear that real lives are at stake in these matters, with the potential for real harm,“ President L. Rafael Reif said in a statement. ”We need to approach policy making, especially now, with more humanity, more decency — not less.” Under the policy, international students in the U.S. would have been forbidden from taking all their courses online this fall. New visas would not have been issued to students at schools planning to provide all classes online, which includes Harvard. Students already in the U.S. would have faced deportation if they didn’t transfer schools or leave the country voluntarily. Even if an outbreak had forced colleges to move all their classes online during the semester, international students would have been forced to transfer to a school with campus instruction or leave the country. Immigration officials issued the policy last week, reversing the earlier guidance from March 13 telling colleges that limits around online education would be suspended during the pandemic. University leaders believed the rule was part of President Donald Trump’s effort to pressure the nation’s schools and colleges to reopen this fall even as new virus cases rise. The policy drew sharp backlash from higher education institutions, with more than 200 signing court briefs supporting the challenge by Harvard and MIT. Colleges said the policy would put students’ safety at risk and hurt schools financially. Many schools rely on tuition from international students, and some stood to lose millions of dollars in revenue if the rule had taken hold. Harvard and MIT were the first to contest the policy, but at least seven other federal suits had been filed by universities and states. The unexpected decision was welcome news to students across the nation who had been on edge. “I feel relief,” said Andrea Calderon, a 29-year-old biology graduate student from Ecuador. “It would have been a very big problem if I had to leave the country right now.” The City College of New York student said returning home would have made it much harder to finish her thesis and pursue a Ph.D. Internet access at home in Ecuador is spotty, she said, and going through the process to come back to the U.S. in the future would be too expensive. Rahul Lobo, 19, from Goa on the west coast of India, said he feels “an immeasurable amount of relief.” “As it is, we’re living in very uncertain times, and the recent ICE policy just made things even more uncertain,” said Lobo, a rising junior at the University of Notre Dame. “Suddenly I wasn’t worrying about whether I could get back to campus, but more whether I would even be able to finish my degree in four years.“ The American Council on Education, which represents university presidents, applauded ICE’s pullback of the rule. The group called the policy “wrongheaded” and said it drew unprecedented opposition from colleges. “There has never been a case where so many institutions sued the federal government,” said Terry Hartle, the group’s senior vice-president. “In this case, the government didn’t even try to defend its policymaking.” Many opponents, however, were hesitant to call it a closed case. Massachusetts’ Democratic attorney general, who is leading a separate lawsuit against the policy, warned that the Trump administration may attempt again to impose limits on international students. “This is why we sue. The rule was illegal and the Trump Administration knew they didn’t have a chance,” Maura Healey said on Twitter. “They may try this again. We will be ready.” Harvard and MIT argued that immigration officials violated procedural rules by issuing the guidance without justification and without allowing the public to respond. They also argued that the policy contradicted ICE’s March 13 directive telling schools that existing limits on online education would be suspended “for the duration of the emergency.” The suit noted that Trump’s national emergency declaration has not been rescinded and that virus cases are spiking in some regions. Immigration officials, however, argued that they told colleges all along that any guidance prompted by the pandemic was subject to change. They said the rule was consistent with existing law barring international students from taking classes entirely online. Federal officials said they were providing leniency by allowing students to keep their visas even if they study online from abroad. ___ AP reporters Carolyn Thompson in Buffalo and Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report."

The court said that the 87-year-old Ginsburg went to a hospital in Washington on Monday evening after experiencing fever and chills. She then underwent a procedure at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore on Tuesday afternoon to clean out a bile duct stent that was placed last August when she was treated for a cancerous tumour on her pancreas. The statement said the justice “is resting comfortably and will stay in the hospital for a few days to receive intravenous antibiotic treatment.” Ginsburg spent a night in the hospital in May with an infection caused by a gallstone. While in the hospital, she participated in arguments the court heard by telephone because of the coronavirus pandemic. Ginsburg, who was appointed by former U.S. president Bill Clinton and joined the court in 1993, has been treated four times for cancer. In addition to the tumour on her pancreas last year, she was previously treated for colorectal cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009. She had lung surgery to remove cancerous growths in December 2018. Speaking at a news conference in the Rose Garden on Tuesday evening, President Donald Trump was asked about Ginsburg. He said he hadn’t heard she had been hospitalized. “I wish her the best. I hope she’s better,“ he said."

The marble statue of a saluting Confederate soldier was taken to a Civil War cemetery in a secluded area of campus. Students and faculty have pushed the university for years to move the statue, but they have said in recent weeks that their work was being undermined by administrators’ plan to beautify the cemetery — a plan that critics said could create a Confederate shrine. A draft plan by the university indicated that the burial ground will have a lighted pathway to the statue. It also said headstones might be added to Confederate soldiers’ graves that have been unmarked for decades. Ole Miss Chancellor Glenn Boyce said Tuesday that the plan for headstones was being abandoned. Boyce said a recent survey with ground-penetrating radar showed that bodies are buried close to the surface. “I feel excavating within the walls of the cemetery presents a significant risk of disturbing remains,” Boyce said in a statement. “This is a risk I am not prepared nor willing to take.” The University of Mississippi was founded in 1848, and the statue of the soldier was put up in 1906 — one of many Confederate monuments erected across the South more than a century ago. Critics say the statue’s location near the university’s main administrative building has sent a signal that Ole Miss glorifies the Confederacy and glosses over the South’s history of slavery. The state College Board on June 18 approved a plan to move the monument. The decision happened amid widespread debate over Confederate symbols as people across the U.S. and in other countries loudly marched through the streets to protest racism and police violence against African Americans. The statue at Ole Miss was a gathering point in 1962 for people who rioted to oppose court-ordered integration of the university. In February 2019, a rally by outside pro-Confederate groups at the monument prompted Ole Miss basketball players to kneel in protest during the national anthem at a game later that day. Student government leaders voted two weeks later for a resolution asking administrators to move the monument to the cemetery, where Confederate soldiers killed at the Battle of Shiloh are buried. One of the student senators sponsoring that resolution was Arielle Hudson of Tunica, Mississippi, who graduated this year and has been selected as a Rhodes scholar. She said Thursday that her joy at knowing the statue was moved was tempered by concerns about the university’s elaborate cemetery plan. Hudson said she was pleased to hear that Boyce abandoned the headstone plan but she wishes he had done it without having to be pressured by hundreds of students, faculty members and alumni. As a student, Hudson gave tours to prospective students through an “ambassador” program. She said ambassadors were generally told to avoid the Confederate statue, but she once ended up near it. “Those conversations were hard, especially as a Black student trying to convince other Black students and their families that they belong here,“ Hudson said Thursday. ”You’re standing a few feet away from an object that tells them that space wasn’t made for them.” The University of Mississippi has worked for more than 20 years to distance itself from Confederate imagery, often amid resistance from tradition-bound donors and alumni. The nickname for athletic teams remains the Rebels, but the university retired its Colonel Reb mascot in 2003 amid criticism that the bearded old man looked like a plantation owner. In 1997, administrators banned sticks in the football stadium, which largely stopped people from waving Confederate battle flags. The marching band no longer plays “Dixie.” Because of a student-led effort, the university in 2015 stopped flying the Confederate-themed Mississippi flag. A groundswell of support from business, religious, education and sports leaders recently pushed legislators to retire the flag. Since 2016, the university has installed plaques to provide historical context about the Confederate monument and about slaves who built some campus buildings before the Civil War. A plaque installed at the base of the Confederate statue said such monuments were built across the South decades after the Civil War, at a time when aging Confederate veterans were dying. “These monuments were often used to promote an ideology known as the ‘Lost Cause,’ which claimed that the Confederacy had been established to defend states’ rights and that slavery was not the principal cause of the Civil War,” the plaque says. “Although the monument was created to honour the sacrifice of Confederate soldiers, it must also remind us that the defeat of the Confederacy actually meant freedom for millions of people.” ___ Follow Emily Wagster Pettus on Twittter at http://twitter.com/EWagsterPettus.

The shooting occurred in Eaton County, southwest of Lansing, about 30 minutes after the stabbing at a Quality Dairy store, state police Lt. Brian Oleksyk said. A sheriff’s deputy spotted the man’s vehicle in a residential neighbourhood and shot him when he got out of his car and tried to attack her, Oleksyk said. “Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon!” the officer, a 22-year veteran, demanded, according to neighbourhood security video released by police. The man, Sean Ruis, was holding a screwdriver and knives, Eaton County Sheriff Tom Reich said. “It’s very unfortunate she had to use her weapon, but she had to save her life,” Reich said. “She had to use deadly force. She did it properly.” Ruis, 43, of Grand Ledge, who worked at the Michigan Department of Transportation, died at a hospital. He was suspected of stabbing a 77-year-old man inside the store when he was confronted about not wearing a mask, Oleksyk said. The stabbing victim was in stable condition at a hospital. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has ordered people to wear masks in stores to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus. “The goal here is to be safe. We all have to do our part so this doesn’t spread,” Reich said. The decision about whether to wear a mask in public for some has become a political statement, and there have been other violent encounters. In May, a security guard at a Family Dollar store in Flint was fatally shot after denying entry to a customer without a mask. Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, a Republican, said masks are important. But he also urged the general public not to confront people over a lack of a mask. “There is no reason to risk your health or your life over the debate of wearing masks in public,” Shirkey said. ___ Follow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwhiteap "

The Seward City Council voted Monday to raze the Jesse Lee Home, once a Methodist-run facility where orphans and other displaced children from Alaska Native villages were sent, many after the Spanish Flu epidemic of a century ago. The home’s most famous resident was Benny Benson, a 13-year-old Aleut who won a territory-wide contest in 1927 with his flag design — seven gold stars forming the Big Dipper, pointing to the larger golden North Star, all on a field of blue. The design became the state flag after Alaska was admitted into the union in 1959. Benson is believed to be the only Indigenous person to design a state flag. “Seward is being painted in a light that we don’t respect our history,” Seward Mayor Christy Terry said before the council voted to spend a $1 million state grant for demolition. “We have the opportunity to preserve the history and the legacy of a very important structure to the Alaska people, but it doesn’t mean that we have to preserve the building,” she said. The plan is to raze the two remaining rundown buildings of the Jesse Lee Home and eventually build a memorial at the site with community input. Terry has said her idea would be to have a pavilion using some of the salvaged wood from the property along with storyboards detailing the history and historical importance of the home. She also envisions a playground after closing another one nearby so that space could be opened up for housing. The children’s home was moved to Seward from Unalaska and opened in 1925. It operated there until it was heavily damaged in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, and the children were moved to Anchorage in 1966. The Seward site sat unused for more than five decades, and efforts to revitalize the home by private and public groups sputtered over the years. “It’s a very sad outcome after many years of concerted effort and kind of lost opportunities, but I do respect their decision,” said Judy Bittner, who has worked with Seward many times on the Jesse Lee Home since she became the state historical preservation officer in 1984. More than 20 letters were read at the council meeting, many calling for the city to save the historical structure. “We’re definitely disappointed,” said Trish Neal, president of the Alaska Association for Historic Preservation, a group that hoped for a reprieve for the structure. “I think we made a great effort to show the council and the community that there are a lot of people out there who supported saving the building.” One resident said she will be happy to see the home gone. “The funds are available and there is opportunity to beautify the area while still respecting the Jesse Lee Home history,” Rhonda Hubbard wrote to the council. “We need to demolish this old building, a building that is beyond repair, serves only as a hazard and visual blight to Seward.” Hubbard said the community has “Jesse Lee Home fatigue, and it is important we not allow it to take up more of our time and energy.” Seward-born Jackie Pels, who now lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, is publisher of “Family After All: Alaska’s Jesse Lee Home.” “I’m wistful, but I think it’s the only sensible decision at this time of statewide economic pain worsened by pandemic,” Pels said in an email to The Associated Press. “The prospect of a ‘story pavilion’ on the site, commemorating the lives of hundreds of people as well as the birth of the beloved flag, is greatly appealing, and who better than Seward’s community of artists and historians to bring it about?” she said."

Okinawan officials on Sunday said most of the cases since early July were at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which is at the centre of a relocation dispute. Others were at Camp Hansen, Camp Kinser and Camp McTureous. On Tuesday, Kadena Air Base reported two positive cases. Combined with three cases at Kadena in March, the total among the U.S. service members on Okinawa is 100, officials said. “We have discovered a number of problems,” Defence Minister Taro Kono said. “We need to more strictly scrutinize the situation with the U.S. military in Japan.“ Kono said the problems were discovered after Japanese officials requested information from the U.S. military. He refused to give details, but said the problems exist at U.S. bases throughout Japan, not just on Okinawa. In a possible indication of one of the problems, Kono said Japanese officials are inspecting a hotel used by the U.S. military to house service members newly assigned to Okinawa from the U.S. while they undergo a 14-day self-quarantine. Okinawan officials and residents have raised concerns about whether adequate safety measures are in place at the hotel. Later Tuesday, officials said no infections or major problems were found at the hotel and those staying there are not allowed to go out during their two-week quarantine. Current hotel residents will move to facilities on base next week, while the hotel will then accommodate those leaving Okinawa. Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki has criticized the U.S. military for a lack of transparency regarding the coronavirus, saying it has caused concern among residents. Tamaki in telephone talks Saturday with Lt. Gen. H. Stacy Clardy, commander of III Marine Expeditionary Force, demanded the U.S. military increase transparency, improve disease prevention measures, stop sending personnel from the mainland U.S. to Okinawa and seal the bases. The U.S. military has told Okinawa that all infected people have been isolated and the bases are virtually under lockdown, officials said. “We are taking prudent measures to prevent further spread of COVID-19 and will continue to communicate with our force, our families, and our local communities about positive COVID-19 cases,” Kadena base said Tuesday on its Facebook page. Okinawa is home to more than half of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact. Residents have long been sensitive to U.S. base-related problems such as pollution, noise and crime. Okinawans also oppose a planned relocation of Futenma Air Base from its current site in a densely populated area in the south to a less populated area on the east coast, and instead want the facility removed entirely from the island. Outside the bases, Okinawa has reported only about 150 coronavirus cases. Nationwide, Japan has confirmed 20,000 cases including about 1,000 deaths. ___ Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi "

The agency co-ordinating Thailand’s coronavirus response also announced Tuesday it is rolling back regulations for admitting foreign visitors in order to tighten up procedures. The incidents involving newly arrived foreigners emerged after seven weeks during which Thailand’s only new confirmed cases of the coronavirus were from Thais repatriated from abroad, with no cases of local transmission reported. The government has been eager to begin the process of reopening the country to foreign visitors, especially tourists who are vital contributors to the economy. Anger was palpable in the eastern province of Rayong, where a member of a visiting 31-member Egyptian military team who tested positive for the disease apparently skirted regulations to go shopping with his colleagues. The second case involved the infected 9-year-old daughter of a foreign diplomat whose family returned from Sudan and stayed in their condominium in Bangkok. Taweesilp Visanuyothin, spokesperson for the government’s Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration, said a contact tracing app indicated that 1,882 people may have crossed paths with the infected Egyptian and urged them to self-isolate for 14 days and get tested as soon as possible. Seven people known to have had direct contact with the man have already been quarantined. Officials in Rayong closed several schools and a mall and sealed off part of the hotel where the Egyptians stayed. Long lines of people formed outside one of the two malls the Egyptians visited, where health authorities were offering free coronavirus tests. Medical personnel in two mobile ambulances administered nose swabs. “I come to this place quite often,” said Pattamaporn Wonggnam, a 28-year-old office worker, “When I heard the news, I was quite worried.” The incident apparently is the first to test the government’s Thai Chana contact tracing system, in which visitors to malls and other public places scan a QR code with their phones upon entry and exit. The government said it would send messages to those flagged as being at possible risk. Deputy Public Health Minister Satit Pitutecha confirmed at a news conference in Rayong that the infected Egyptian was part of a group that went shopping. He blamed them for not co-operating with rules guiding the isolation of foreign visitors. The COVID-19 centre on Monday revealed the details of the Egyptian military team’s stopovers at U-Tapao airport in Rayong. The group arrived in Thailand via the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan on the night of July 8 and flew to Chengdu in China and back on July 9. They were tested for the coronavirus on July 10 and that same day members of the group visited several public locations, including two malls, in Rayong. By the time the results of the infected man’s test were processed on July 11, the Egyptian team had departed for home. COVID-19 centre spokesman Taweesilp said Tuesday that landing permission is being revoked for eight Egyptian flights due to lack of co-operation from last week’s visiting military team. The Egyptian Embassy in Thailand released a statement Tuesday expressing “its most sincere regrets and sympathies” to all affected by the incident. It said it was working with the Thai authorities to mitigate any threat to public health, and offered assurances that its military crews follow strict health measures before embarking on flights. The entire team involved in the Rayong incident “had passed COVID-19 screening before initiation of travel,“ it said. Taweesilp, the Thai spokesperson, also said permission for three categories of foreign visitors who were recently allowed entry — VIP guests of the government, diplomats or representatives of international organizations, and businesspeople and investors and others on approved missions — was temporarily postponed pending a revamp of entry procedures. The latter group would be allowed to travel on special repatriation flights for Thais. In Rayong, a 68-year-old company manager expressed her distress over how the government handled the situation. “I am angry because this shouldn’t happen. They should have been quarantined, same as Thais who travel back who have to be quarantined for 14 days,” said Panpen Sakulkru. “Why did this group of people receive a privilege and was able to skip the quarantine?” A third revision of rules by announced by the COVID-19 centre will require arriving diplomats to stay in state-supervised quarantine for 14 days instead of self-isolating. That ruling was apparently in response to the case of the daughter of a diplomat from Sudan whose family travelled from their homeland on July 7 and reportedly tested negative for the coronavirus on arrival in Bangkok. However, the girl was retested after showing symptoms and was found to be positive. The family has been staying in a condominium in Bangkok which health authorities will now investigate for any spread of the disease. Diplomats, unlike ordinary foreigners entering Thailand, did not have to stay at state quarantine facilities, but the rules guiding their quarantine were not clearly spelled out. —— Associated Press writer Busaba Sivasomboon in Bangkok contributed to this report."

The report highlighting the government’s defence priorities was adopted by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Cabinet on Tuesday, less than a day after the Trump administration rejected outright nearly all of Beijing’s significant maritime claims in the South China Sea in a statement likely to deepen the U.S.-China rift. The Abe government’s Defence White Paper 2020 highlights what are potential Chinese and North Korean threats as Japan tries to further increase its defence capability. Under Abe, Japan has steadily increased its defence budget and capability and purchased costly American arsenals. Defence Minister Taro Kono recently scrapped the deployment of a pair of costly U.S. land-based missile intercepting systems due to technical issues, and Abe quickly announced his intention to revise Japan’s defence guidelines, possibly allowing Japan to go beyond its conventional defence-only role under the Japan-U.S. security alliance, including discussing a possibility of acquiring a preemptive strike capability. The White Paper accused China of using propaganda, including spreading disinformation, about the spread of the coronavirus. “The COVID-19 pandemic may expose and intensify strategic competition among countries intending to create international and regional orders more preferable to themselves and to expand their influence,” the report said. “We need to closely watch their move with serious concern affecting the national security.” As evidence, a Japanese Defence Ministry official noted that a Chinese Foreign Ministry official had posted on Twitter in March an accusation that the U.S. military had spread the coronavirus in Wuhan and that Chinese media have touted herbal medicine as effective COVID-19 treatments. He spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing department rules. The annual report said China has “relentlessly” pushed to “change the status quo” in the Asian seas, including sending 3,000-ton class government vessels into Japanese waters around Japan-controlled disputed East China Sea islands called Senkaku in Japanese. Beijing also claim the islands and call them Diaoyu. China is also pursuing its unilateral attempt in the South China Sea even more aggressively and even expanding its area of activity into more distant seas, a concern shared by the international community, the report said. The South China Sea problem “directly affects peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.” “As China now boasts its capability and makes attempts to unilaterally change the status quo in many places, we must closely grasp what China’s intentions are,” Kono told a news conference Tuesday. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that Japan’s defence paper is full of prejudice and false information against China, and that it tried its best to hype the so-called “China threat.” “China has always firmly maintained its sovereignty, security and development interests. All attack or discredit on China are futile,” Zhao said. He urged Japan to stop deliberately intensifying tensions and get along with China. The report also cited North Korea’s continued development of its nuclear and other weapons programs. The North is “relentlessly pursuing increasingly complex and diverse modes of attack and is steadily strengthening and improving its attack capabilities,“ the report said. It said North Korea since May 2019 has launched three types of new short-range ballistic missiles that use solid fuel and fly at lower altitudes than their conventional missiles that can breach Japanese missile defence system. As Japan’s relations with South Korea have plunged to their lowest levels recently over wartime history, export control and territorial issues, the report prompted Seoul to protest Japan’s claims over a set of small South Korea-controlled islets between the countries. The report mentions the islands as part of Japanese territories that remain unresolved. Foreign ministry spokesman Kim In-chul issued a statement urging Tokyo to “immediately” remove such claims from the report, saying that the islets called Dokdo in the Koreas and Takeshima in Japan are South Korean territory by international law. ___ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, and researcher Liu Zheng in Beijing contributed to this report. ___ Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi "

China accused the U.S. on Tuesday of trying to sow discord between China and the Southeast Asian countries with which it has long-standing territorial disputes in waters that are both a vital international shipping lane and home to valuable fisheries. “The United States is not a country directly involved in the disputes. However, it has kept interfering in the issue,” the Chinese Embassy in Washington said on its website. “Under the pretext of preserving stability, it is flexing muscles, stirring up tension and inciting confrontation in the region.” Other governments avoided direct comment on the U.S. announcement. The Philippine presidential spokesperson, Harry Roque, noted that the two powers would woo his country as they escalate their rivalry, but “what is important now is to prioritize the implementation and crafting of a code of conduct to prevent tension in that area.” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a statement released Monday, said the U.S. now regards virtually all Chinese maritime claims outside its internationally recognized waters to be illegitimate. The new position does not cover land features above sea level, which are considered to be “territorial” in nature. Previously, the U.S. had only insisted that maritime disputes between China and its smaller neighbours be resolved peacefully through U.N.-backed arbitration. Pompeo’s statement was a major shift in America’s South China Sea policy, said Zhu Feng, the director of a South China Sea studies centre at Nanjing University. He said other countries challenging China’s claims may take a more aggressive stance because of America’s openly stated support. “The U.S. didn’t use to comment on the sovereignty issue in the South China Sea, because it itself is not a claimant,” Zhu said. “But this time it has made itself into a judge or arbiter. It will bring new instability and tension.” He advised against a strong response from China, saying that current U.S. policy is being driven in a significant way by President Donald Trump’s reelection considerations. “Trump’s current China policy is insane,” Zhu said. “He is making the China issue the most important topic for his election to cover his failure in preventing the epidemic and to divert public attention. I have no idea how far he will go in fully utilizing the China issue.” An Indonesian analyst agreed that the announcement was a political one to divert attention from Trump’s weaknesses at home. A.A. Banyu Perwita, an international relations professor at President University, predicted it would focus more attention on the Indo-Pacific corridor but not have dramatic consequences. “It will be not more than a political diplomatic statement,“ he said, adding that ”we need to make the atmosphere calm now. The best position for all now is the current status quo.” James Chin, head of the Asia Institute at the University of Tasmania in Australia, said the U.S. stance was nothing new because it has always rejected China’s “nine-dash line,” as its claim to the South China Sea is known. “What is new is that Trump has sort of made the South China Sea a new focus point for his confrontation with China,” he said. Both Indonesia and the Philippines joined Pompeo in calling on China to abide by an international arbitration court ruling in 2016 that disqualified many of China’s claims. Malaysia’s foreign ministry declined to comment. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian reiterated China’s position that it has had effective jurisdiction over the islands, reefs and waters of the South China Sea for more than 1,000 years. He said at a daily briefing Tuesday that China is not seeking to build a maritime empire. China’s emergence as a military power and its ambitions to extend its offshore reach have come into conflict with the U.S., which has been the dominant naval power in the western Pacific in the post-World War II period.

The 28,498 cases reported in the past 24 hours took the national total to 906,752. Cases have jumped by 100,000 in four days. The Health Ministry also reported another 553 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking total fatalities up to 23,727. India has largely lifted its nationwide lockdown, and the virus has been spreading at a significant rate, prompting several big cities to impose partial lockdowns. The southern city of Pune started a 10-day lockdown Tuesday in an attempt to break the chain of infections. Only essentials including milk shops, pharmacies, doctors’ clinics and emergency services will be allowed open. Eight of India’s 28 states, including the worst-hit Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and New Delhi, account for nearly 90% of cases. India is the third worst-affected country in terms of infections, only behind the United States and Brazil. In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region: — Authorities in Thailand are urging nearly 1,900 people to quarantine themselves and get tested for the coronavirus after a breakdown in screening allowed two foreigners with the disease to pose a risk to public health. The agency co-ordinating Thailand’s coronavirus response also announced it is tightening regulations that had allowed the entry of some foreign visitors. Taweesilp Visanuyothin, spokesman for the Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration, said a contract tracing app showed that 1,882 people may have crossed paths with an infected member of a visiting Egyptian military team. He asked them to self-isolate for 14 days and get tested as soon as possible. Seven people already known to have had direct contact with the Egyptian have already been quarantined. Officials in the eastern province of Rayong closed several schools and a mall, sealed off part of the hotel where the Egyptians stayed and gave free coronavirus tests to people who feared they had contact with the infected man. The second case involves the infected 9-year-old daughter of a foreign diplomat whose family returned from Sudan and stayed in their condominium in Bangkok. — Australia’s Queensland state is toughening the punishment for those who break coronavirus quarantine rules. Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the current fines for breaking a mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine for some visitors or lying about their whereabouts may not be a sufficient penalty. The maximum penalty will now be a higher fine or up to six months’ imprisonment. Queensland reopened its borders to all but Victoria state residents two weeks ago. Victoria is the centre of Australia’s recent outbreak, adding 270 new infections overnight to its more than 4,000 active cases. The Victorian city of Melbourne is under a six-week lockdown to try to contain the outbreak. — South Korea reported 33 new cases of COVID-19 as its prime minister called for vigilance ahead of the summer holiday season. The figures announced by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention brought the caseload to 13,512 cases, including 289 deaths. Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun urged people to avoid crowded areas, maintain distance with others and wear masks as they travel to beaches and other areas during the holiday season. — China said the number of people in treatment for COVID-19 in the country has fallen to just 297, with only three new cases of coronarvirus reported, all brought from outside the country. No new deaths were announced, leaving the total at 4,634 out of 83,605 cases of the disease. A pair of experts from the World Health Organization were in China on Monday to make arrangements for an investigation into how the pandemic may have spread after the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year."

The anti-polio campaign would last three days, from next Monday, with the plan to have about 800,000 children vaccinated, the officials said. Police departments have received requests to ensure the safety of the polio workers. Rana Mohammad Safdar, who oversees anti-polio operations in the country, said polio workers would adhere to social distancing regulations while carrying out their duty. The announcement comes after Pakistan’s powerful army chief, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, told Microsoft co-founder and billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates last month that despite the challenge of COVID-19, the government planned to restart polio vaccinations across the country. Bajwa gave no date at the time. Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria are the three countries in the world where polio — a disabling and life-threatening disease caused by the polio virus — is still endemic. The non-profit Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has helped Pakistan and other places worldwide fight the disease. The World Health Organization at a meeting in June reviewed the polio situation in Pakistan and elsewhere and extended travel restrictions, initially enforced in 2014, that require people to get vaccinated against polio a month before travelling to Pakistan. Pakistan had hoped to eliminate the disease by 2018, when only 12 cases were reported. But there was a surge in new cases the following year. Since January, Pakistan has reported 58 new polio cases from various parts of the country, including the northwestern region bordering Afghanistan. The Taliban and other militants regularly stage attacks on polio teams and security forces escorting them,a s well as vaccination centres and health workers because they claim the anti-polio drive is part of an alleged Western conspiracy to sterilize children or collect intelligence. The attacks on polio teams increased after it was revealed that a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign was used as a ruse by the CIA in the hunt for al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos in 2011 in Pakistan. Pakistan has had more than 253,000 cases of the coronavirus, including 5,320 deaths, since the first infection was detected in February. On Tuesday, it reported 1,979 cases — a substantial decrease in daily infections since May, when the lockdown was eased, causing a surge in COVID-19 infections and deaths."

Last week, Turkey cancelled the sixth-century former cathedral-turned-mosque’s 86-year status as a museum and said it would open for Muslim worship as of July 24. The decision sparked criticism in the United States, Greece, and other Western countries as well as from Orthodox Christian leaders. Pope Francis expressed sadness over the move. EU foreign ministers, holding their first face-to-face meeting in months on Monday, declared that they “condemned” the decision. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said there was “broad support to call on the Turkish authorities to urgently consider and reverse this decision.” Asked to comment on the EU criticism, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a joint news conference with his visiting Maltese counterpart: “We reject the word ‘condemnation.’“ “This is a matter that concerns Turkey’s sovereign rights,” he said. He argued that there were several mosques in EU-member Spain that had been converted into churches. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, meanwhile, described the 1934 decision by the Turkish Republic’s secular, founding leaders that converted Hagia Sofia from a mosque into a museum as a mistake. “We are rectifying a mistake. It’s as simple as that,” Erdogan said in a televised address, following a weekly Cabinet meeting. Erdogan maintained that the criticisms levelled against Turkey over Hagia Sophia’s return to a mosque were a “pretext” for enmity toward Turkey and Islam. He also said his country was determined to preserve the structure’s qualities as a cultural heritage. On Tuesday, Greece again expressed dismay at Turkey’s decision. “This decision is certainly painful to us as Greek Orthodox Christians but it also hurts us as citizens of the world,” said Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. “This is not a Greek-Turkish issue, it is not even a Euro-Turkish issue, it is global. It is a universal issue.” Mitsotakis added: “With this setback, Turkey is choosing to sever ties with the Western world and its values. It abandons a cultural direction of many centuries, preferring introversion. And it wraps with an artificial mantle of strength over its weakness.” Meanwhile, officials from Turkey’s religious affairs authority, said the landmark structure can remain open to visitors outside of prayer hours, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. The Christian depictions inside are no obstacle to Muslim prayers, said the officials who are preparing the site for Muslim worship. They added however, that the figures would need to be covered with curtains or through other means during the prayers, in line with Islamic traditions that prohibit such representations."

The setback sunk modest hopes that the three countries could resolve their differences and ink an agreement before Ethiopia begins to fill its $4.6 billion hydroelectric dam. Ethiopia had previously pledged to start filling the reservoir, even without a deal over its operation, at the start of the wet season in July, when rains flood the Blue Nile. A declared window of two to three weeks to resolve the dispute is closing fast. To Ethiopia, the colossal dam offers a critical opportunity to pull millions of citizens out of poverty and become a major power exporter. To downstream Egypt, which depends on the Nile River to supply its farmers and booming population of 100 million with fresh water, the dam poses an existential threat. Years of talks with a variety of mediators, including the Trump administration, have failed to produce a solution. Last week’s round, mediated by the African Union and observed by American and European officials, proved no different. Filling the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam without a deal would sharply escalate tensions in the bitter dispute. Experts fear it could push the countries to the brink of military conflict. “All of the efforts exerted to reach a solution didn’t come to any kind of result,” said Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukry Monday in an interview with Egypt’s DMC TV channel. Shukry warned Egypt may be compelled to appeal again to the U.N. Security Council to intervene in the dispute, a prospect Ethiopia rejects, preferring regional bodies like the A.U. to mediate. “If there is something that threatens the regional security of Egypt and international security, it is the main responsibility of the Security Council to adopt procedures that will prevent this,” he said. Meanwhile the countries agreed they would send their reports to the president of the African Union, and reconvene in a week to determine next steps. There was no immediate comment from Ethiopia on the latest round of talks. Between Egypt and Ethiopia lies Sudan, literally and figuratively. The African country stands to benefit from Ethiopia’s project through access to cheap electricity and reduced flooding, but it has also raised fears over the dam’s operation, which could endanger its own smaller dams, depending on the amount of water discharged daily downstream. In a press conference on Monday, Sudanese Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas explained a series of sticking points. While the parties were “keen to find a solution,” technical and legal disagreements persist over its filling and operation, he said. Most important, he said, are the unresolved questions of how much water Ethiopia will release downstream if a multi-year drought occurs, and how the countries will resolve any future disputes. Hisham Kahin, a member of Sudan’s legal committee in the dam negotiations, said 70%-80% of negotiations turned on the thorny question of whether an agreement would be legally binding. Ethiopia, he said, fears a binding agreement will hinder its future development projects. Sudan and Egypt consider it critical. “All suggestions are under discussion,” said Kahin. “We have made very little progress.”"

The international lender expects an overall economic contraction of 7.3% in Mideast oil exporting countries this year due to hits from the coronavirus outbreak and oil market turmoil. The contraction is 2% greater than the IMF’s initial projections in mid-April. “We are in a year like no other and therefore developments are very fast and coping with them is challenging for everyone,” Jihad Azour, director of the IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia department, told The Associated Press. The IMF had projected in April that Saudi Arabia’s economy would contract by about 2.3% this year. It has since revised that figure downward, saying the kingdom stands to see economic growth shrink by 6.8% before climbing to around 3% growth next year. In addition to lower crude prices and cuts to production, Saudi Arabia stands to lose billions of dollars in revenue because the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca is suspended due to the pandemic. For the first time in Saudi history, the hajj pilgrimage this month, which drew 2.5 million people last year, will not include pilgrims from outside the kingdom. To raise state revenue, Saudi Arabia tripled taxes on basic goods and services this month, increasing value-added tax to 15%. While the IMF has for years been urging Gulf states to introduce tougher austerity measures, “we did not recommend the specific measure here” for Saudi Arabia, Azour said. He said the IMF’s overall recommendation now is that governments that can afford to do so should consider the risks of a second wave of coronavirus and introduce measures that shore up the economy and protect the livelihoods of people. Meanwhile, oil-importing Mideast countries, which include Egypt, Jordan and Sudan, are expected to see an overall economic contraction of 1.1%, nearly unchanged from the IMF’s April projections. The overall level of inflation in these countries, however, is expected to reach 10%. There are massive challenges across the region, including in Lebanon, where inflation has mushroomed to 56% over the past year and where the currency has lost nearly two-thirds of its value. The most current IMF forecast predicts a 12% economic contraction this year in the small Mediterranean country, which hosts large populations of Syrian and Palestinian refugees. The IMF has held more than a dozen meetings with Lebanese authorities over a $10 billion loan request. The IMF says it is still working to assess the country’s financial losses as different arms of the government offer diverging figures. Additionally, Iran is struggling to manage the outbreak of the virus there as officials refuse to impose lockdown measures that would further rattle its economy battered by U.S. sanctions. In a sign of just how dire the economic situation has become, Iran requested a $5 billion loan from the IMF this year — the first such request made by the country in nearly six decades. Azour said the IMF continues to look into Iran’s loan request, which the Trump administration has publicly opposed. “This (coronavirus) crisis highlighted the vulnerabilities that exist in the system,” Azour said, especially in countries where there are high levels of informal workers and youth unemployment. “We are calling for revamping social protection, improving access to social services, and also increasing the level of financial inclusion to help and support those who are vulnerable,” he said. Since the start of the year, the IMF has approved about $17 billion in emergency loans to countries in the Middle East and the wider region, including $5.2 billion for Egypt and nearly $1.4 billion for Pakistan."

The case, brought by Amnesty International in January, called on the court to prevent NSO from selling its technology abroad, especially to repressive regimes. The Tel Aviv District Court ruled that Amnesty’s attorneys did not provide sufficient evidence “to prove the claim that an attempt was made to track a human rights activist by trying to hack his cellphone” or that the hacking was done by NSO. “Granting a license is done after the most rigorous process and also after granting the permit, the authority conducts oversight and close inspection, as necessary,” the court said. If human rights are found to be violated, that permit can be suspended or cancelled, it added. The court issued its ruling on Sunday, but only made it public on Monday. Gil Naveh, spokesman for Amnesty International Israel, said the group was disappointed but not surprised. “It’s been a longstanding tradition for the Israeli courts to be a rubber stamp for the Israeli Ministry of Defence,” he said. The group doesn’t know what evidence NSO or the Defence Ministry gave to the court, because the hearings were closed. “Even if we knew, we were not able to talk about it,” he said. In 2018, Amnesty claimed one of its employees was targeted by NSO’s malware, saying a hacker tried to break into the staffer’s smartphone, using a WhatsApp message about a protest in front of the Saudi Embassy in Washington as bait. NSO, an Israeli hacker-for-hire company, uses its Pegasus spyware to take control of a phone, its cameras and microphones, and mine the user’s personal data. The company has been accused of selling its surveillance software to repressive governments that use it against dissidents. It doesn’t disclose clients, but they are believed to include Middle Eastern and Latin American states. The company says it sells its technology to Israeli-approved governments to help them combat criminals and terrorism. NSO Group said in a statement that the company “will continue to work to provide technology to states and intelligence organizations,“ adding that its purpose is to ”save human lives.” In a report published last month, Amnesty International said Moroccan journalist Omar Radi’s phone was tapped using NSO’s technology as part of the government’s efforts to clamp down on dissent. A Saudi dissident has accused NSO of involvement in Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s killing in 2018."

The report released late Saturday by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization comes months after the Jan. 8 crash near Tehran killed 55 Canadian citizens, 30 permanent residents and dozens more with ties to Canada. Authorities had initially denied responsibility, only changing course days later after Western nations presented extensive evidence that Iran had shot down the plane. The report may signal a new phase in the investigation into the crash, as the aircraft’s black box flight recorder is due to be sent to Paris, where international investigators will finally be able to examine it. The flight was on the first leg of a trip to Canada via Kyiv, Ukraine at the time. The shootdown happened the same night Iran launched a ballistic missile attack targeting U.S. soldiers in Iraq, its response to the American drone strike that killed Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Jan. 3. At the time, Iranian troops were bracing for a U.S. counterstrike and appear to have mistaken the plane for a missile. The civil aviation report does not acknowledge that, only saying a change in the “alertness level of Iran’s air defence” allowed previously scheduled air traffic to resume. The report detailed a series of moments where the shootdown of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 could have been avoided. The report said the surface-to-air missile battery that targeted the Boeing 737-800 had been relocated and was not properly reoriented. Those manning the missile battery could not communicate with their command centre, they misidentified the civilian flight as a threat and opened fire twice without getting approval from ranking officials, the report said. “If each had not arisen, the aircraft would not have been targeted,” the report said. Western intelligence officials and analysts believe Iran shot down the aircraft with a Russian-made Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15. In 2007, Iran took the delivery of 29 Tor M1 units from Russia under a contract worth an estimated $700 million. The system is mounted on a tracked vehicle and carries a radar and a pack of eight missiles. The report did not say why the Guard moved the air defence system, though that area near the airport is believed to be home to both regular military and bases of the paramilitary Guard. The report notes that the Ukrainian flight had done nothing out of the ordinary up until the missile launch, with its transponder and other data being broadcast. “At the time of firing the first missile, the aircraft was flying at a normal altitude and trajectory,” the report said. The plane had just taken off from Imam Khomeini International Airport when the first missile exploded, possibly damaging its radio equipment, the report said. The second missile likely directly struck the aircraft, as videos that night show the plane exploding into a ball of fire before crashing into a playground and farmland on the outskirts of Tehran. The report put the blame entirely on the crew of the missile battery. Already, six people believed to be involved in the incident have been arrested, judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili reportedly said in June. He said at the time three had been released on bail while the other three remained held. In recent months, Iran has repeatedly delayed releasing the aircraft’s so-called black box, which includes data and communications from the cockpit leading up to the shootdown. The U.S., under international regulations, has a right to be part of the investigation as the plane involved was a Boeing. Iran is to send the black box to France on July 20, where Ukrainian and French experts are expected to examine it, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency recently reported. Iranian officials did not have the equipment on hand to read data from the box. The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians — including many Iranians with dual citizenship — and 11 Ukrainians, according to officials. The route was popular with those travelling onward to Canada. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates."

In a regular Cabinet meeting on the coronavirus, Rouhani said the easiest way to fight the virus is to close off all activities. But “then people come and stage protests because of chaos, famine and problems,“ he said. Confirmed virus cases and deaths reached a record low in May after mass lockdowns were imposed in Iran. But since then, the numbers have spiked again, with officials saying a combination of improved testing and re-openings has driven the surge. Rouhani urged that ceremonies be held with a limited number of participants. Many experts blame an increase in virus-related deaths over the past week on wedding and funeral ceremonies with large crowds. Ali Reza Zali, the head of Tehran’s virus task force, in a letter to officials banned any conferences, festivals or exhibitions and limited participants in wedding and funeral ceremonies to 10. Earlier this week, Iran reported 221 fatalities in a 24-hour period, the highest single-day death toll. Rouhani’s remarks came as many experts urged a halt to business activities to stop the increase in virus related deaths that have exceeded 12,600 out of 255,117 confirmed cases. Iranian officials have been particularly eager to remove restrictions on its economy, already crippled by sanctions the U.S. imposed after the Trump administration’s 2018 withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement. A sharp rise in subsidized gasoline prices led to four days of unrest in cities and towns across Iran in November, which rights group Amnesty International said led to more than 300 people being killed in clashes with police and security forces. Tehran has yet to release any official statistics about the scale of the unrest, though in June the government acknowledged that the security forces shot and killed protesters and a lawmaker said that 230 people were killed in the anti-government protests."

In an interview with the state-owned PAP news agency Kaczynski said there was a “powerful media front inspired from the outside“ during the presidential campaign. He named a TV station in Poland that is owned by an American corporation. “The media in Poland should be Polish,” Kaczynski said. Kaczynski said he wants to see “balance in the media among the different options,” calling it a “condition of democracy.” He said there are policies the government could promote to accomplish that goal but vowed that “we will not do anything that would threaten media freedom.” “We cannot ban them from taking part, I believe, in campaigns that are inspired from the outside, from destroying some and ignoring others, from painting a totally false picture of Poland and of the world,“ he said. ”But we can take steps to have a situation in which there will be more of the media which sees the reality in a more realistic way than we have now.”"

Helge Braun, who has co-ordinated the country’s fight against the pandemic from the start, said the government is considering limiting travel in and out of areas that see a sudden, unexplained surge in COVID-19 cases. “Our measures are appropriate to preventing a second big wave,” Braun told The Associated Press during an interview at the Chancellery in Berlin. “But this requires us to stay the course, not get careless in our measures, and maintain our respect for the virus.” Germans have watched in horror as cases in the United States, Brazil and elsewhere surged long after Germany flattened its own curve of infections in April. The country of 83 million has reported slightly over 200,000 confirmed cases and 9,077 deaths from COVID-19 since the start of the outbreak; the rate of new infections now averages about three per 100,000 inhabitants a week. Braun attributed Germany’s relative success in part to swift action during the early stages of the pandemic. As a trained emergency room doctor, the 47-year-old said he was aware of the risks if hospitals became overwhelmed with cases. “It was a great concern of mine to prevent such a situation,” Braun told the AP. While other governments considered letting the virus sweep through the population to get the pandemic over with sooner, Germany never seriously toyed with the idea of ‘herd immunity.’ “Our conclusion was that unless one brings the infection under control very strongly, then it will tend to grow exponentially,” Braun said. “We discarded herd immunity as a political policy completely.” Social distancing measures and the wearing of face masks in stores and on public transit, which have become an issue of contention in Germany and elsewhere, will likely remain compulsory for the coming months, Braun said. “It’s a fact that the infections are so low precisely as a result of these measures,” he said. “That distancing was maintained, that there are hygiene plans, that masks are worn.” “These measures aren’t obsolete with low numbers,” Braun said. “Instead, we have to continue to maintain them in order to keep the infection numbers low.” The focus should instead be on reviving economic and social life despite those measures, he said. “Wearing masks is the smallest restriction one needs to accept to prevent infection.” Braun declined to comment directly on the escalating number of confirmed cases in the United States, but said his office was in constant contact with other governments to exchange best practices in fighting the pandemic. “The experience we always share is that restrictive measures, especially when it comes to leisure activity, are very, very effective,“ he said. ”That a broad testing strategy is very, very helpful, and that early isolation of clusters can be a way to prevent more widespread restrictions.” Braun also cited Japan’s approach of sealing off areas where there are new infection clusters, noting that similar moves would be possible in Germany, too, under rules the federal and state governments agreed to three months ago. A partial lockdown imposed on two German counties last month following an outbreak at a slaughterhouse caused anger and confusion among residents, who were told they would be turned away from some German regions unless they could produce evidence they recently tested negative for the coronavirus. Braun said that if the source of infection can’t be directly identified and interrupted “then of course it’s logical and also necessary to limit travel in an out of such especially affected areas.” Pressed on whether this could mean police roadblocks, he declined to elaborate. Asked about the idea later Tuesday during a visit to Bavaria, Merkel suggested it was preferable for people to have certainty about travel restrictions than to find themselves banned from some places but not from others. “It’s a proposal one should discuss and one that I would advocate,” she said. The idea of travel restrictions is likely to be sensitive given the country’s 40-year partition during which residents of communist East Germany were forbidden from freely going to the West. Braun, whose day job as Merkel’s chief of staff includes co-ordinating the government’s digital policy, also helped spearhead the development of a smartphone app to notify individuals who might have been exposed to someone with the virus. Germany’s Corona-Warn-App has been downloaded more than 15.5 million times since its launch last month. Germany, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency for the next six months, wants leaders meeting in Brussels later this week to agree on an unprecedented 500 billion euro ($569 billion) stimulus package to revive the bloc’s pandemic-hit economies. “That’s a strong signal of solidarity,“ said Braun. ”We want all European countries to get through the crisis well.” ___ Follow Frank Jordans on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter "

The two neighbours in the South Caucasus have been locked in conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of Azerbaijan that has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a war there ended in 1994. International efforts to settle the conflict have stalled. Armenian and Azerbaijani forces have frequently engaged in clashes. The current skirmishes appear to mark the most serious spike in hostilities since 2016 when scores were killed in four days of fighting. The latest incident began Sunday when Armenian and Azerbaijani troops exchanged fire in the northern section of their border. Officials in both countries blamed each other for starting the fighting and said that sporadic shelling has continued. Azerbaijan’s Defence Ministry said two senior officers, Maj. Gen. Polad Hashimov and Col. Ilgar Mirzayev, were killed in fighting Tuesday along with five other servicemen. Armenian officials claimed that Azerbaijani drones launched an attack on the Tuvush province town of Berd, targeting civilian infrastructure. Defence Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said that one of Azerbaijani drones was downed. Stepanyan also charged that the Azerbaijani military used civilians as shields, placing artillery close to the village of Dondar Gushchu in the Tovuz district about 10 kilometres (six miles) from the border. “The Azerbaijani side has surrounded its own population with artillery batteries, making them a target, and then complained that the Armenian forces fired in that direction,” she said on Facebook where she posted images of the Azerbaijani artillery around the village. The Azerbaijani military denied losing a drone and in turn claimed that its forces shot down an Armenian drone and destroyed an Armenian artillery system along with its crew. As hostilities continued, Armenia also accused Azerbaijan of launching cyberattacks on Armenian government websites. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on Monday accused Azerbaijan of provoking the clashes and warned that it would “bear responsibility for the unpredictable consequences.” Azerbaijani President Ilhan Aliyev denounced what he described as “another provocation of Armenia” and vowed to protect Azerbaijan’s national territory. Turkey, which has close ethnic and cultural ties with Azerbaijan, has voiced strong support to Baku in the conflict. The United States and Russia, which co-chair the Minsk group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that has tried to negotiate a settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, have condemned the violence and called for restraint. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had separate calls with his counterparts in Armenia and Azerbaijan on Monday to call for an immediate ceasefire. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Tuesday that Moscow was “deeply worried” about the fighting and stands ready to play mediator. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also expressed worry. His spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said in a statement that the U.N. chief “urges an immediate end to the fighting and calls on all involved to take immediate steps to deescalate the situation and refrain from provocative rhetoric.” ___ Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, and Edith M.

Following days of procrastination and mixed messages, British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the wearing of face coverings will be mandatory in shops and supermarkets in England from July 24. On the other side of the English Channel, amid signs of a slight virus resurgence in France, President Emmanuel Macron said he also wants to require masks inside all indoor public spaces by Aug. 1. Britain and France previously took a more relaxed attitude to face coverings than many other European nations, recommending masks but not requiring them. Germany, Spain, Italy and Greece already require masks to be worn in enclosed spaces. But with their economies reeling after months-long lockdowns, French and U.K. government leaders were anxious to try to persuade people to spend again — hopefully without spreading the virus. Weeks of indecision made way for new rules that came into view virtually overnight. Britain’s Hancock told lawmakers in the House of Commons Tuesday that face covers can help workers and shoppers alike. “In recent weeks, we have reopened retail and footfall is rising,“ he said. “We want to give people more confidence to shop safely and enhance protection for those who work in shops.” People in England already have to wear face coverings on public transport and in hospital settings. Anyone not wearing a face covering in the additional environments outlined by the government could be fined 100 pounds ($125,) and shops can refuse entry to anyone failing to comply. Children under 11 and those with certain disabilities will be exempt. The new requirement only applies to England. The other nations of the U.K. — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — can determine their own public health policies, and Scotland already requires masks in shops. Hancock stressed that wearing a face covering complements other accepted strategies aimed at keeping a lid on the pandemic, such as washing hands and abiding by social distancing rules. “We cannot let our progress today lead to complacency tomorrow,” he said. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who in April spent a week in the hospital being treated for COVID-19, began wearing a bright blue mask in public last week. The change in policy followed. In an interview with French television networks marking Bastille Day, France’s Macron said “the best prevention” against the virus is masks, social distancing and hand washing. Recent rave parties in France and widespread backsliding on social distancing — even within Macron’s presidential palace and other government facilities — have raised concern lately, so the government has been weighing tougher mask guidance. “We have signs that (the virus) is picking up a bit,” Macron said, noting that France’s virus reproduction rate is inching past 1 again, meaning each infected person is infecting at least one other. British authorities are hoping the public will comply with the new requirement. London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the BBC he believed that “Londoners by and large will follow the rules,” without too much need for the police. “The problem is not the issue of enforcement, the problem is the mixed messages and the confused communications,’’ Khan said. British Environment Secretary George Eustice also did not rule out the possibility that mandatory face coverings would become compulsory in offices and other workplaces in the future. He told the BBC that the government was taking “one step at a time and we’ve taken the view in this next step that we should make it mandatory in retail environments.” A growing body of evidence suggests wearing face coverings brings some benefit in preventing the spread of the virus. “Lack of strong evidence of their effectiveness should not be considered a problem but the evidence is accumulating that they have a part to play in reducing transmission and also in protecting the wearer,“ said Keith Neal, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham. ___ Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report."

Yet for thousands of participants in a protest across town, the national homage wasn’t nearly enough to make up for missteps by French President Emmanuel Macron and his government before and during the coronavirus pandemic. Riot police sprayed tear gas and unruly demonstrators hurled smoke bombs as the largely peaceful demonstrators marched to Bastille plaza, where the French Revolution was born on July 14, 1789. The contrasting scenes marked a Bastille Day like any other, overshadowed by fears of resurgent infections in a country where more than 30,000 people have already lost their lives to the coronavirus. With tears in their eyes or smiles on their faces, medical workers stood silently as lengthy applause in their honour rang out over the Place de la Concorde in central Paris from Macron, the head of the World Health Organization and 2,000 other guests. A military choir sang the Marseillaise national anthem, and troops unfurled an enormous French tricolour flag across the plaza. The battle against the virus was the main focus, as Macron sought to highlight France’s successes in combating its worst crisis since World War II. Mirage and Rafale fighter jets painted the sky with blue-white-and-red smoke, and were joined by helicopters that had transported COVID-19 patients in distress. The guests included nurses, doctors, supermarket and nursing home workers, mask makers, lab technicians, undertakers and others who kept France going during its strict nationwide lockdown. Families of medical workers who died with the virus also had a place in the stands. Medics in jeans or sandals strolled onto the plaza for the climax of the ceremony, and the lengthy military parade was truncated into a smaller affair closed to the public to prevent new virus infections. In eastern Paris, meanwhile, medical workers’ unions marched to decry years of cost cuts that left public hospitals ill-prepared when the virus raced across France. “We are enormously short of personnel,” said protester Sylvie Pecard, a nurse at the Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris who described colleagues falling ill with the virus as COVID-19 patients filled its wards. “It’s because we haven’t recruited nurses. I came here 20 years ago and there were no empty positions. Now all the services are short of personnel, and it’s worse and worse.” Other protesters chanted slogans against police violence, spoke out against racial injustice, or against Macron policies seen as favouring the wealthy, or against his decision to appoint a man accused of rape to oversee French police forces. Some protesters wore yellow vests, representing their movement against economic injustice — or face masks in the same neon yellow shade. Riot police closely surrounded the crowd, and smoke from tear gas and firecrackers swirled around Bastille Plaza after sporadic tensions. Demonstrators sang in support of medical workers, while the Bastille Opera house displayed a huge message of thanks surrounded by portraits of nurses and doctors by street artist JR. In an interview with French television networks, Macron addressed the anger his presidency has unleashed, acknowledging “mistakes” in managing the pandemic and in pushing through business-friendly reforms. “Our country is afraid. There is a crisis of trust,” he said. He noted a new 8-billion-euro investment and hiring plan signed this week for French hospitals, but warned of “massive” unemployment and other economic problems still to come after months of virus lockdown. He announced no significant policy changes for the remaining 22 months of his term. He said masks would be required in indoor public places by Aug. 1, but that schools should resume as usual in September. France has one of the world’s highest virus death tolls, and scientists are warning of a potential resurgence as people abandon social distancing practices, hold dance parties and head off on summer vacations. At the main Bastille Day event, troops sported masks as they got in formation, took them off for the ceremony, then put them on again when it was over. Macron made a point of donning his before speaking to WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus. One government member panicked when she realized she forgot hers, but was saved by a colleague with a spare. All around France, towns and cities scaled back holiday festivities to stem virus infections. For Tuesday’s annual fireworks display over the Eiffel Tower, City Hall is closing off the heart of Paris, including embankments of the Seine and other neighbourhoods where crowds usually gather on Bastille Day. ___ Jeffrey Schaeffer, Christophe Ena and Francois Mori contributed to this report."

Merkel visited Herrenchiemsee palace — an opulent 19th-century edifice on a lake island inspired by France’s Versailles — at the invitation of Bavarian governor Markus Soeder. Her trip fed speculation about jostling in her Union bloc to run for chancellor in Germany’s next election, expected in the fall of 2021. Merkel, Germany’s leader since 2005, says she won’t seek a fifth term Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party plans to choose a new leader, its second since Merkel stood aside in 2018, in December. Three high-profile contenders are vying for the job and with it, a chance to be nominated as the centre-right candidate for chancellor. But the pandemic hasn’t helped them. Armin Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, was a vocal advocate of easing infection-control restrictions and has been criticized for his crisis management. Rivals Friedrich Merz and Norbert Roettgen don’t have government jobs and have had little chance to make an impact. That has put the spotlight on Soeder, the leader of the Christian Social Union — the CDU’s Bavaria-only sister party. Recent polls have shown Soeder, who was the first governor to lock down his state in March and has advocated a cautious approach to reopening, far ahead of the others among voters. Soeder has deflected questions about his future by saying that his place is in Bavaria. But he also raised eyebrows by suggesting recently that only someone who has proven himself in a crisis could run for chancellor — and by inviting Merkel to Tuesday’s Bavarian Cabinet meeting at Herrenchiemsee. No sitting chancellor had previously attended one. Soeder stressed their “common conviction of (the need for) prudence and caution.” Asked whether Soeder has what it takes to be chancellor, Merkel said she was exercising “particular restraint” on her succession and wouldn’t comment. She said she’d be happy to visit the Cabinets of other German states. “I can only say that Bavaria has a good governor and he invited me today,” Merkel said. “You’re not going to hear more from me.” No Christian Social Union candidate has previously become Germany’s leader. The party provided the centre-right’s candidates in 1980 and 2002, but both lost to incumbent centre-left chancellors."

The country’s Supreme Electoral Council said in a resolution published Tuesday that parties will have until June 7, 2021 — five months before the vote — to complete the legal registration process. Critics said the resolution was invalid, because such changes in voting rules should be approved by the national legislature. Elections, and term limits which President Daniel Ortega has already exceeded, have been an issue in protests in recent years. Ortega, 74, returned to power in 2007 following three failed attempts to win the presidency and won re-election in 2011. He sidestepped term limits to get himself re-elected in 2016, and packed courts and government agencies with allies. His Sandinista party controls the courts and the legislature. At least 325 people were killed in anti-government protests in 2018, according to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Starting in April 2018, Nicaragua’s economy was devastated by nearly five months of unrest initially sparked by cuts to social security benefits but which quickly evolved into calls for Ortega to step down and allow early elections. Nicaragua’s two main opposition groups announced the earlier this year they will form a coalition to compete in the 2021 race. Neither the Civic Alliance for Justice and Democracy nor the Blue and White National Unity movement are among Nicaragua’s political parties. Both formed after civil unrest exploded in April 2018."

Tuckman made Mexico her home for the next two decades, reporting, mainly for The Guardian, on drug violence, the disappeared, the struggles of women and migrants, and the uneven transition to democracy. In one of her last articles, published Jan. 2, she wrote about a new imprint of Mexican writer Tita Valencia’s 1976 novel Minotaur Fighting and other “works by Latin American women who were once feted but have fallen out of print.” Tuckman, 53, died in Mexico City on July 9 after being diagnosed with cancer last year. Colleagues remembered her as a committed journalist who mentored young writers. Jenaro Villamil, the head of Mexico’s public radio and TV system, praised Tuckman’s 2012 book “Mexico: Democracy Interrupted” and said she “fell in love with Mexico, with its bright and its dark sides.” “Jo’s departure deeply saddened all of us who knew her, of her commitment to social causes, to her great work and to life in general,” said Edgardo Buscaglia, an organized crime expert at Columbia University. Tuckman worked in the 1990s for The Associated Press as a freelancer in Guatemala, and then a staff employee in Spain. She also reported from Mexico for The Daily Telegraph and was an editor for Vice Mexico. A mother of two, she gravitated early toward Latin America, focusing on the region for a master’s degree at the University of London. Journalist Lomi Kriel spent time with Tuckman in the Darien rainforest in Panama, near the border with Colombia, while reporting in 2013 on climate change. They travelled in dug-out canoes and stayed with an Indigenous Emberá community, sleeping side by side in a thatched home on stilts. Tuckman generously shared knowledge about “freelancing and working internationally in difficult situations as a woman,” said Kriel, then a freelancer nervous about the assignment. “She has always been a role model, both in how she treated everyone around her and the adventure and light with which she approached learning about the world as a journalist. She is deeply missed – even by those who only met her once,” Kriel, who now works for the ProPublica/Texas Tribune investigative unit, wrote in an email. Ahead of 2012 elections that returned Mexico’s old ruling PRI party to power, Tuckman reported in The Guardian on documents purportedly showing that a unit of Televisa, Mexico’s leading TV and radio broadcaster, supported and promoted Enrique Peña Nieto, the PRI candidate. Televisa denied allegations of political bias. Tuckman also covered the 2014 disappearance of 43 students from a teacher’s college in the southern state of Guerrero, one of the most horrific cases of violence and corruption during Peña Nieto’s government. The students were abducted by local police and then allegedly turned over to a local gang that killed them and burned some of their bodies. “The challenge now is to make sure that interest is maintained in what is going on in Mexico so that the pressure that has been gathering around those issues of human rights, those issues of corruption, those issues of lack of accountability and transparency, don’t just fade away,” Tuckman said to Las Perlas TV, an online video service. Last week, Mexican authorities said they had identified the remains of a second of the 43 students who disappeared. It was a small step in a country haunted by impunity, corruption and extreme violence. Tuckman delivered plenty of humour and humanity in her reporting. On assignment for the AP, she interviewed a Mexican tequila industry regulator who displayed a bottle adorned with a vulture in dark glasses and said it “gives you the message, `Let’s go crazy.? In 2014, she wrote in The Guardian about violence driving Central American child migrants to the U.S. border and spoke to a man who said: “My granddaughter was the apple of my eye... I cried for a month after she left, but it is the best thing. Honduras is not a place for children.” The work, Tuckman said in a 2013 interview with Mexican journalist Blanche Petrich, is “a privilege.?"
33,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/news/world/americas/2020/07/13/brazil-sacks-official-after-soaring-june-deforestation-data.html,Brazil sacks official after soaring June deforestation data,['David Biller And Mauricio SavareseThe Associated Press'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazil’s government on Monday fired an official at the national space agency Inpe whose department is responsible for satellite monitoring of the Amazon rainforest, just three days after the release of June deforestation data reflected a continued increase in degradation. Lubia Vinhas was the general-co-ordinator of Brazilian space agency Inpe’s Earth Observation Institute, which is an umbrella for divisions that monitor the Amazon and panels to debate climate change with civil society organizations. It’s unclear whether the removal of Vinhas from her position was connected to the data. Her subordinate who heads the division directly overseeing satellite monitoring of Amazon deforestation remains employed. Inpe said in a statement posted to its website Monday night that the change was part of a shake-up at the agency to improve synergies. Still, the timing of the dismissal -- coming on the heels of June data -- drew an outcry from environmentalists who claim it may be an echo of a high-profile firing at the same agency last year. President Jair Bolsonaro is a critic of environmentalists and defends fostering more economic development in the Amazon, which many adversaries see as a nod to illegal miners and loggers. Vinhas was picked in 2018 for a four-year but Science and Technology Minister Marcos Pontes decided to remove her after 2 years and 3 months on the job. Inpe said in its statement that Vinhas’ former department will be merged with others, and she will oversee implementation of a new georeferencing database. Inpe figures published on Friday showed 400 square miles (1,034 square kilometres) of deforestation in the Amazon in June, a new record the month since data started being gathered in 2015. Total deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon from January to June was 1,890 square miles (3,069 square kilometres), up 25% from the same six-month period last year. Outside observers are keeping close tabs on Brazil’s environmental stewardship just ahead of the so-called burning season, during which landholders use fire to clear brush and forest. That includes asset managers who say they are assessing whether to divest from Brazil and last week spoke with the environment minister and Vice-President Gen. Hamilton Mourão, . Bolsonaro also put the Army in charge of efforts to curb deforestation in May after last year’s fires pushed destruction to the highest level in 11 years. Yet data from Inpe show that it kept climbing. Marcio Astrini, the executive-secretary of the Brazilian Climate Observatory, a coalition of civil society groups, alleged that the government has previously made clear its desire to intervene in Inpe. “The removal of Lubia Vinhas could be an indication that the plan was never abandoned. This is happening as deforestation accelerates, when the administration needs to stop threats of divestment,” Astrini said in a statement. Suely Vaz, former head of environment regulator IBAMA, said before the release of the June data that the army isn’t using the technical planning and intelligence required, nor are they trained in such methods to stop deforestation. She added that it costs more than $10 million per month for the army to operate in the Amazon -- more than half what IBAMA spends on oversight in a year. “Control of deforestation isn’t done by sending a lot of inexperienced people to the field,” Vaz said. “They can help, but the operations need to be conducted by environmental authorities.” In the midst of the international outcry over the Amazon fires in August, Bolsonaro accused the then-head of Brazil’s space research institute, Ricardo Galvão, of manipulating satellite deforestation data in order to undermine his administration. Galvão publicly countered the claims, and was fired. _____ Savarese reported from Sao Paulo."

López Obrador said Monday he will travel to Guanajuato, Jalisco and Colima on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Guanajuato was the site of a massacre in which 27 people in an unregistered drug rehabilitation centre were killed by gunmen this month. Jalisco is the home of the hyper-violent Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which was suspected of carrying out the brazen attack on Mexico City’s police chief, which he survived with three bullet wounds in late June. In Colima, in mid-June, gunmen believed to be from the Jalisco cartel, killed a federal judge and his wife in their home.

The potential buyer, who government officials declined to reveal, would pay in cash and medical equipment. The offer was made in April. Sales of tickets in a symbolic raffle for the plane have also resumed after a monthslong pause caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly a quarter of the 6 million $25 tickets have been sold. Each of the 100 winners will collect about $1 million. López Obrador wants to sell the plane, which he views as an extravagance. The president flies commercial, including for his first trip abroad last week to Washington with layovers both ways. The custom Boeing 787 was purchased for $200 million under his predecessor, Enrique Peña Nieto. It has been difficult to sell because it is configured to carry only 80 people and has a full presidential suite with a private bath. Experts say it would be costly to reconfigure into a typical passenger jet that would carry up to 300 passengers."

Bolsonaro, 65, announced on Tuesday that he tested positive for the virus and had experienced fever, aches and malaise. He scrapped a trip he had planned to northeastern Piauí state, and all his meetings for the week were converted to video calls. One was with former congressman Roberto Jefferson, president of the conservative PTB party. Jefferson told The Associated Press that he went to the presidential Planalto Palace and sat in front of a large television where he could see Bolsonaro in a makeshift office at his residence. “I found the president well, flushed, willing. In very good health,” Jefferson said Saturday. “I only saw him cough once, when I made a joke.” Since his diagnosis, Bolsonaro has held virtual meetings almost every day with Jorge Oliveira, secretary-general of government, to sign official documents. According to Oliveira’s office, a protocol was created so work could be carried out digitally. This was also how Bolsonaro interviewed candidates to head the education ministry, he said on Facebook on Thursday. The following day, he named to the post Milton Ribeiro, a former deputy dean of Mackenzie University in Sao Paulo who preaches at a Presbyterian church in Santos, outside the metropolis. Only a few aides who were previously infected by the new coronavirus could get close to Bolsonaro during the week, one of them said on Tuesday. The person declined to be named, citing lack of authorization to speak with journalists. Bolsonaro also spent some time in the afternoons in front of the palace with photojournalists 400 yards away, on the other side of a garden. He had met his supporters by that garden until his diagnosis, but no longer. The new routine marks a stark change for Bolsonaro, who spent months attending rallies with his fans, heading out to bakeries and food trucks to mix and mingle. He sometimes declined to wear a mask. He has scoffed at the restrictions mayors and governors implemented to contain the spread of the virus, arguing their economic impacts would cause more suffering than the virus, which he repeatedly called “a little flu.” Bolsonaro took hydroxychloroquine pills for five days, Monday through Friday, according to a member of the presidential medical team who asked to not be identified, citing patient confidentiality and because the person isn’t authorized to speak publicly. The drug has no proven effect on the treatment of COVID-19 and can cause side effects such as cardiac arrhythmia, according to medical studies. As a result, Bolsonaro was subjected to electrocardiograms and blood tests, the person said. Brazil’s presidential press office said in a statement that the president has experienced no medical problems with his treatment. The aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said Bolsonaro slept in a different bedroom to keep the first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, safe. He lives with her, his daughter and step-daughter. On Saturday, the first lady shared a photo of her COVID-19 test results showing she was not infected. “My daughters and I tested negative for COVID-19,” she wrote in the post on her verified Instagram account. “I appreciate the prayers.” On Thursday, Jair Bolsonaro held his weekly live broadcast on Facebook. This time, he was not accompanied by a minister or a sign language interpreter, as usual. Despite saying he felt well, he said he should still be isolated next week, so as to avoid contaminating anyone. “I’m sorry I can’t interact with you here. Not even next week will it be possible, because I think I will not yet be completely free of the virus, so I will not have anyone on my side here,” Bolsonaro said on the broadcast. During the broadcast, he wasn’t wearing a mask. But the aide said Bolsonaro now regularly wears the equipment to protect both his family and the more than 100 employees who work at the residence."

The images emerge as Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan say the latest talks on the contentious project ended Monday with no agreement. Ethiopia has said it would begin filling the reservoir of the $4.6 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam this month even without a deal, which would further escalate tensions. But the swelling reservoir, captured in imagery on July 9 by the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 satellite, is likely a “natural backing-up of water behind the dam” during this rainy season, International Crisis Group analyst William Davison told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “So far, to my understanding, there has been no official announcement from Ethiopia that all of the pieces of construction that are needed to be completed to close off all of the outlets and to begin impoundment of water into the reservoir” have occurred, Davison said. But Ethiopia is on schedule for impoundment to begin in mid-July, he added, when the rainy season floods the Blue Nile. Ethiopian officials did not comment on the images. The latest setback in the three-country talks shrinks hopes that an agreement will be reached before Ethiopia begins filling the reservoir. Ethiopia says the colossal dam offers a critical opportunity to pull millions of its nearly 110 million citizens out of poverty and become a major power exporter. Downstream Egypt, which depends on the Nile to supply its farmers and booming population of 100 million with fresh water, asserts that the dam poses an existential threat. Experts fear that filling the dam without a deal could push the countries to the brink of military conflict. But Kevin Wheeler, a researcher at the Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, told The Associated Press that fears of any immediate water shortage “are not justified at this stage at all. If there were a drought over the next several years, that certainly could become a risk.“ He said the escalating rhetoric is more due to changing “power dynamics” in the region. Years of talks with a variety of mediators, including the Trump administration, have failed to produce a solution. Last week’s round, mediated by the African Union and observed by U.S. and European officials, proved no different. “Although there were progresses, no breakthrough deal is made,” Seleshi Bekele, Ethiopia’s minister of water, irrigation and energy, tweeted overnight. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukry in an interview with Egypt’s DMC TV channel warned Monday that Egypt may be compelled to appeal again to the U.N. Security Council to intervene in the dispute. Ethiopia rejects that, preferring regional bodies like the African Union to mediate. Meanwhile the countries agreed they would send their reports to the AU and reconvene in a week to determine next steps. Between Egypt and Ethiopia lies Sudan, which stands to benefit from the dam through access to cheap electricity and reduced flooding. But it has also raised fears over the dam’s operation, which could endanger its own smaller dams depending on the amount of water discharged daily downstream. Sudanese Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas on Monday said the parties were “keen to find a solution” but technical and legal disagreements persist over its filling and operation. Most important, he said, are the questions about how much water Ethiopia will release downstream if a multi-year drought occurs and how the countries will resolve any future disputes. Hisham Kahin, a member of Sudan’s legal committee in the dam negotiations, said 70% to 80% of negotiations turned on the question of whether an agreement would be legally binding. ___ Associated Press writers in Cairo contributed."

That’s according to a Health Ministry statement and data compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers, which showed the U.K. with 292,931 confirmed cases. The pandemic is now spreading swiftly in parts of the African continent of 1.3 billion people as the world’s most poorly funded health systems begin to face what experts have warned all along: They would be rapidly overwhelmed. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa this week said many more virus infections have gone undetected despite the country conducting more than 2.2 million tests, by far the most of any African nation. A strict lockdown had delayed South Africa’s surge in cases but it has been loosened under economic pressure. Now, what the president calls the “storm” has arrived, and it is already “stretching our resources and our resolve to their limits.” Shortages of medical oxygen have been reported as the number of COVID-19 patients seeking help in breathing grows. Public hospital beds across the country could fill up within the month. South Africa grapples with the pandemic in the dead of winter, with temperatures in the outbreak epicenter, Gauteng province and Johannesburg, forecast to drop below freezing overnight. That makes ventilation a challenge especially in small, crowded homes for the poor. While public health officials in the United States and elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere warn that fall and winter could be a severe test, South Africa is already demonstrating some of the dangers to come. ___ Follow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak "

State television South African Broadcasting Corporation has reported that Mandela died at a Johannesburg hospital early Monday morning. The cause of her death has not been announced. She had been South Africa’s ambassador to Denmark since 2015. The Mandelas’ daughter came to international prominence in 1985, when the white minority government offered to release Nelson Mandela from prison if he denounced violence perpetrated by his movement, the Africa National Congress, against apartheid, the brutal system of racial discrimination enforced in South Africa at that time. Zindzi Mandela read his letter rejecting the offer at a packed public meeting that was broadcast around the world. Last year Mandela stirred controversy by calling for the return of the white-owned land to South Africa’s dispossessed Black majority. “Dear Apartheid Apologists, your time is over. You will not rule again. We do not fear you. Finally #TheLandIsOurs,” she tweeted in June last year. South Africa’s foreign affairs minister Naledi Pandor has expressed shock at Mandela’s death, describing her as a heroine. “Zindzi will not only be remembered as a daughter of our struggle heroes, Tata Nelson and Mama Winnie Mandela, but as a struggle heroine in her own right. She served South Africa well,” said Pandor. She is survived by her husband and four children."

Confronted by surging hospitalizations due to the coronavirus, South Africa is also reinstating a night curfew to reduce traffic accidents and made it mandatory for all residents to wear face masks when in public. Ramaphosa said, in a nationally televised address Sunday night, that top health officials warn of impending shortages of hospital beds and medical oxygen as South Africa reaches a peak of COVID-19 cases, expected between the end of July and September. He said some hospitals have had to turn away patients because all their beds are full. South Africa’s rapid increase in reported cases has made it one of the world’s centres for COVID-19, as it is ranked as the 9th country most affected by the disease, according to Johns Hopkins University. The country has reported increases of more than 10,000 confirmed cases for several days and the latest daily increase was nearly 13,500. South Africa accounts for 40% of all the confirmed cases in Africa, with 276,242, an increase of 12,058 in one day. South Africa has recorded 4,079 deaths, 25% of which have been in the past week, said Ramaphosa. “While the surge of infections has been expected, the force and the speed with which it has progressed has, quite understandably, caused great concern,“ said Ramaphosa. “Many of us are fearful of the danger this presents for ourselves, and for our families.” Ramaphosa said that since the sale of alcohol was re-introduced on in June, hospitals have experienced a spike in admissions in their trauma and emergency wards. The countrywide curfew mandates that people must not be on the roads between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m. effective Monday. Masks have also been declared mandatory, with all transport operators, employers, and owners of businesses and buildings now legally obliged to ensure everyone entering their businesses or premises are wearing masks. Ramaphosa lambasted citizens who have continued to have social gatherings, including parties and overcrowded funerals, saying they had contributed significantly to the rapid spread of the virus. “In the midst of our national effort to fight against this virus there are a number of people who have taken to organizing parties, who have drinking sprees, and some who walk around in crowded spaces without masks,” he said. South Africa imposed one of the world’s strictest lockdowns in April and May, including closing virtually all mines, factories and businesses, and a ban on sales of liquor and cigarettes. The measures slowed the spread of the coronavirus but South Africa’s economy, already in recession, contracted dramatically, increasing unemployment above 30% and hunger. In June the country began relaxing restrictions to allow millions of South Africans to return to work. The easing of restrictions allowed the sales of alcohol on four days a week. However, within a few weeks the country’s numbers of confirmed cases and hospitalizations increased dramatically, bringing Ramaphosa to reimpose the ban on alcohol sales and other restrictions. More than 30% of South Africa’s cases are in the economic hub of Gauteng province, which includes the largest city, Johannesburg, and the capital, Pretoria. The tourist centre of Cape Town also has a high number of cases. Johannesburg’s densely populated Soweto township has a high concentration of cases, according to officials. “We knew that with the easing of restrictions, the number of cases would go up. But what is surprising is the speed with which the case numbers have grown,” said Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, who is on the national coronavirus committee that is advising Ramaphosa. “We can expect to see the numbers of cases and hospitalizations to increase for a number of weeks ... this will continue for the next six to eight weeks. By October we may be seeing a decline.” South Africa has carried out 2.1 million tests, on its population of 58 million. Because of an international shortage of testing materials, South Africa in June experienced a long delay in the time to get test results, at one point reaching 12 days in government clinics. The situation has improved and the average time to get test results is five days in by public laboratories and two days in private labs, according to the latest figures issued by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. Africa’s 54 countries have reported 577,904 cases, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The continent’s confirmed cases are concentrated in four countries -- South Africa, Egypt with 81,158 cases, Nigeria with 31,987 cases and Algeria with 18,712 cases – which together make up more than 65% of the continent’s cases. The number of actual cases in Africa is believed to be much higher, as the testing rate is very low in many countries."

LedererThe Associated Press'],"Sat., July 11, 2020","TANZANIA, Tanzania - Russia scored a victory for its ally Syria on Saturday by forcing the Security Council to limit humanitarian aid deliveries to the country’s mainly rebel-held northwest to just one crossing point from Turkey, a move that Western nations say will cut a lifeline for 1.3 million people. Russia argues that aid should be delivered from within the country across conflict lines, and says only one crossing point is needed. U.N. officials and humanitarian groups argued unsuccessfully — along with the vast majority of the U.N. Security Council — that the two crossing points in operation until their mandate expired Friday were essential for getting help to millions of needy people in Syria’s northwest, especially with the first case of COVID-19 recently reported in the region. The Security Council vote approving a single crossing from Turkey was 12-0, with Russia, China and the Dominican Republic abstaining. The vote capped a week of high-stakes rivalry pitting Russia and China against the 13 other council members. An overwhelming majority voted twice to maintain the two crossings from Turkey, but Russia and China vetoed both resolutions — the 15th and 16th veto by Russia of a Syria resolution since the conflict began in 2011 and the ninth and 10th by China. Germany and Belgium, which had sponsored the widely supported resolutions for two crossing points, finally had to back down to the threat of another Russian veto. The resolution they put forward Saturday authorized only a single crossing point from Turkey for a year. In January, Russia also scored a victory for Syria, using its veto threat to force the Security Council to adopt a resolution reducing the number of crossing points for aid deliveries from four to two, from Turkey to the northwest. It also cut in half the yearlong mandate that had been in place since cross-border deliveries began in 2014 to six months. Before adopting the resolution Saturday, the council rejected two amendments proposed by Russia, including one suggesting that U.S. and European Union sanctions on Syria were impeding humanitarian aid. That contention was vehemently rejected by the Trump administration and the EU, which noted their sanctions include exemptions for humanitarian deliveries. It also rejected an amendment from China. Russia’s deputy U.N. ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, said after the vote that from the beginning Moscow had proposed one crossing — from Bab al-Hawa to Idlib — and that Saturday’s resolution could have been adopted weeks ago. He said Russia abstained in the vote because negotiations over the resolution were marred by “clumsiness, disrespect.” Polyansky accused Western nations on the council of “unprecedented heights” of hypocrisy, saying they were ready to jeopardize cross-border aid over the references to unilateral sanctions. He said cross-border aid to Syria’s northwest doesn’t comply with international law because the U.N. has no presence in the region, which he described as being controlled “by international terrorists and fighters” that make it impossible to control and monitor who gets aid. German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen retorted that while Russia talks about delivery of aid across conflict lines, “in practice it doesn’t” happen. He said his side fought to maintain multiple crossing points for aid, including the Al-Yaroubiya crossing point from Iraq in the northeast that was closed in January, because that is what is needed for efficient delivery of aid to millions in need — and he asked Polyansky “this is clumsy?” “This is what we tried to do over these past weeks, to get the optimum to the population,” Heusgen said. U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft told the council: “Today’s outcome leaves us sickened and outraged at the loss of the Bab al-Salaam and Al Yarubiyah border crossings.” “Behind those locked gates are millions of women, children, and men who believed that the world had heard their pleas. Their health and welfare are now at great risk,” she said. Still, Craft called the authorization of access through Bab al-Hawa for 12 months “a victory” in light of Russia and China’s “willingness to use their veto to compel a dramatic reduction in humanitarian assistance.” “This solemn victory must not end our struggle to address the mounting human needs in Syria — that fight is far from over,” Craft said. Belgium and Germany said in a joint statement that 1.3 million people, including 800 000 displaced Syrians, live in the Aleppo area, including 500,000 children who received humanitarian aid through the Bab al-Salam crossing — and now have that aid cut off. “Today is yet another sad day. It is a sad day for this council, but mostly, it is a sad day for the Syrian people of that region.,” they said. “Both Yarubiyah and Bab al-Salam were vital crossings to deliver, in the most efficient way possible, the humanitarian help, those people deserve.” In a later statement, they added: “One border crossing is not enough, but no border crossings would have left the fate of an entire region in question.”"

The turnout was far smaller than the thousands who surged through the streets Friday, briefly occupying the state television station and setting fires. At least three people had been killed and more than 70 wounded in the two days of demonstrations, according to a report from the Gabriel Toure Hospital in Bamako to government officials that was seen by The Associated Press. There were also reports of arrests of opposition leaders. Friday’s developments marked a major escalation in the growing movement against President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, who still has two years left in office in this West African country long destabilized by Islamic extremists. His overnight address to the nation took a conciliatory gesture days after he had tried to appease the protesters by promising to revamp the constitutional court whose legislative election results in April have been disputed by several dozen candidates. “I would like once again to reassure our people of my willingness to continue the dialogue and reiterate my readiness to take all measures in my power to calm the situation,” he said. The anti-government movement still wants the National Assembly dissolved. Its name, the June 5 Movement, or M5, reflects the day demonstrators first took to the streets en masse. While the group has officially backed down from its calls that Keita leave office, some protesters still want him gone. “At this point, all possible scenarios are possible. We are in a cycle of ingovernability,“ Baba Dakono, a researcher and political analyst, told AP. “It is difficult now to say whether President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita can still benefit from the support of the army,” because the behaviour of the officers in contact with the troops can’t be predicted. “Dialogue between the parties is necessary to break the deadlock,” he said. Keita came to power after a French-led military operation to oust Islamic extremists from power in northern Mali’s towns in 2013, winning the first democratic elections organized after a military coup the year before. Despite the presence of U.N. peacekeepers, and French and regional forces backing Malian troops, extremist groups continue to mount attacks. Last year was particularly deadly as hundreds of soldiers were killed in the north, forcing the military at one point to close down some of its most remote and vulnerable outposts. It prompted criticism of how the government was handling the crisis. The last democratically elected leader before Keita, President Amadou Toumani Toure, was overthrown in the 2012 coup after a decade in power. The political chaos that ensued has been blamed for creating a power vacuum that allowed the Islamic insurgency to take hold in the north. Following international pressure, that coup leader later handed over power to a civilian transitional government that organized elections."

Muller shocked lawmakers in the right-of-centre party when he issued a statement early Tuesday morning saying he was stepping down “effective immediately.” The 67-year-old former business executive had led the party for only 53 days, toppling previous leader Simon Bridges in a leadership coup amid National’s stagnant polling numbers. Collins was chosen to take over the leadership in a hastily arranged meeting of the party’s parliamentary caucus in Wellington on Tuesday evening. She is National’s fourth leader in three years and its second female leader. Collins was first elected to Parliament in 2002, serving in governments under prime ministers John Key and Bill English. She held police and corrections portfolios and is seen to represent the right-wing of the National Party, having previously promoted strong law and order policies. Collins now faces the task of trying to rally National’s support 67 days from Sept. 19 elections at which it will try to unseat the governing Labour Party of popular Prime Minister Jacina Ardern. Recent polls show Labour with sufficient support to form a majority government, a first since New Zealand adopted a system of proportional representation in 1996. All previous governments since that time have been coalitions and Labour currently governs with the support of the Green Party and right-of-centre New Zealand First. Muller’s sudden departure forced a scramble of lawmakers to Wellington during a parliamentary recess. Collins is understood to have won a contested leadership contest, but details of the vote have not been released. Muller said his health made his continuation in the leadership untenable. “It has become clear to me that I am not the best person to be leader of the Opposition and Leader of the New Zealand National Party at this critical time for New Zealand,” Muller said. “It is more important than ever that the New Zealand National Party has a leader who is comfortable in the role. “The role has taken a heavy toll on me personally, and on my family, and this has become untenable from a health perspective.” The National Party has been embroiled in scandal for the past week after it was revealed a junior lawmaker leaked private health details of New Zealand coronavirus patients to news media. The information was provided by a former party president who received it confidentially in her capacity as acting chief executive of the Auckland rescue helicopter organization. Muller was a low-profile member of the party when he was chosen to lead the coup that toppled Bridges, whose lack of popularity with voters had begun to worry party lawmakers as the election approached. National has struggled to dent the popularity of charismatic Prime Minister Ardern, whose government has high approval ratings for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand has gone 73 days without a case of community transmission and has suffered only 22 deaths. Life has returned largely to normal with schools, bars and restaurants all open and with packed stadiums at sports events."

The National Archives of Australia released more than 1,200 pages of letters and press clippings between Buckingham Palace and Governor-General Sir John Kerr from August 1974 to December 1977 after a court ruled in May that they could not be kept secret indefinitely. Kerr dismissed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam’s reforming centre-left Labor Party government on Nov. 11, 1975, to resolve a deadlock in Parliament on the authority of the queen, who is Australia’s head of state. The queen’s private secretary, Sir Martin Charteris, wrote to Kerr on Nov. 4, 1975, that the monarch’s power to dissolve a parliament had not been used in years and some argued that the power no longer existed. “I do not believe this to be true,” Charteris wrote. Charteris also wrote that if Kerr did “what the constitution dictates, you cannot possible (sic) do the Monarchy any avoidable harm.” “The chances are you will do it good,” Charteris said. Kerr did not tell the queen he had decided to remove Whitlam and replace him with opposition leader Malcolm Fraser as caretaker prime minister until after he had done it. “I was of the opinion that it was better for Her Majesty not to know in advance,” Kerr wrote on Nov. 11, immediately after taking the unprecedented step. The palace said the letters proved that the decision to dismiss the Whitlam government was Kerr’s alone. “While the Royal Household believes in the longstanding convention that all conversations between prime ministers, governor generals and the queen are private, the release of the letters ... confirms that neither Her Majesty nor the Royal Household had any part to play in Kerr’s decision to dismiss Whitlam,” a palace statement said. Charteris congratulated Kerr for not warning Whitman that he was considering bringing down his government. That could have put the queen in an “impossible position” if Whitlam tried to get her to fire Kerr while Kerr was trying to fire Whitlam. Kerr died in 1991. Charteris also revealed that Whitlam had telephoned him at 4:15 a.m. London time on Nov. 11 as a “private citizen” and said he should be “recommissioned” as prime minister so that he could choose the date of the next election. “He spoke calmly and did not ask me to make an approach to the queen or indeed do anything other than the suggestion that I should speak to you and find out what was going on,” Charteris wrote to Kerr on Nov. 17 . Sydney University constitutional law expert Anne Twomey said the letters undermined the theory that Whitlam had been brought down by the British royal family. The letters show that Whitlam had sought British intervention to keep him in power, she said. “The only smoking gun is Whitlam himself trying to get reinstated,” Twomey said. The only dismissal of an elected Australian government on the authority of a British monarch triggered a political crisis that spurred many to call for Australia to sever its constitutional ties with Britain and create a republic with an Australian president. Suspicions of a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency conspiracy persist. The release of the letters is a victory for historian and Whitlam biographer Jenny Hocking who has been trying for years to get access to them. Hocking said the head of a constitutional monarchy must at all times remain politically neutral. But she said she was startled by the level of discussion that had occurred between Kerr and Buckingham Palace “over matters that were intensely and profoundly political.” She described Charteris’ advice to Kerr on his powers and how they should be used as “scandalous.” “The nature of the letters, the fact that a dismissal of an elected government took place using what are largely seen as arcane reserve powers of the Crown, and the fact ... we can now see such a depth of discussion between the Palace and the governor-general of the time will inevitably make people think about where we want to go as an independent, autonomous nation,” Hocking said. Labour leader Anthony Albanese, Australia’s opposition leader, said the 1975 crisis reinforced the need for an Australian head of state instead of the British monarch. “It is, I think, a blight on our character as a nation that a democratically elected government was dismissed,” Albanese said. “The action of the governor-general on Nov. 11 to dismiss a government, to put himself above the Australian people, is one that reinforces the need for us to have an Australian head of state, reinforces the need for us to stand on our own two feet,” he added."
