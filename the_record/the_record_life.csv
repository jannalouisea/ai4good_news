But there’s one number I’ve been avoiding: the one produced by the bathroom scale. Of course, I don’t need the tool of infinite disappointment to let me know what’s going on with my physique. My clothes have been fitting a little bit tighter in recent weeks, even by the lax guidelines provided by my current everyday wardrobe of sweat pants and a T-shirt. They pair well with my uncut hair, unshaven face and perpetually under-showered body. There’s little doubt I’ve made some poor dietary and lifestyle choices during the pandemic: it’s been an onslaught of bread baking, big-meal making, ordering in and overindulgence. Being surrounded by my children 24/7 – and I love them dearly – has Daddy reaching for the “happy juice” most evenings. And that’s only if I don’t start drinking in the afternoons. My exercise regimen, long the counterbalance against my vices of consumption, has taken a hit as well. While I did plenty of road biking early in the spring, the novelty of the long solo ride has worn off. Group rides with my cycling club – a great motivator to stay in shape so I can keep up – are still on the provincial government’s no-go list. I understand why but I miss them. The whole situation is doubly disappointing because I was doing so well. In January, I went to a largely plant-based diet and hauled my butt to the gym four or five times a week. Not only did the scale go down but I felt better than I had in years. We went to Mexico in March, just before things went into lockdown. It was always going to be a cheat week of sorts, a brief return to my gourmand and beer-guzzling ways. But it was a stressful trip – the government said we should come home just days after we left – and we returned to quarantine and a world forever changed. My cheat week has now lasted three months. It would seem I’m not alone in my struggles. The internet is calling this trend the “Quarantine 15,” a riff on the “Freshman 15” weight gain prevalent in first-year college and university students. (I did that, too!) While it’s easy for me to use the pandemic as a handy excuse for my return to excessive consumption, I hardly need much encouragement. Eating and drinking what I want, when I want, in the quantities I want has always been my default and preferred setting, no matter the consequences. It takes effort and discipline for me to do otherwise. I’m also cutting myself some slack – and I’m certainly not judging anyone else who might be struggling with these same challenges. These are unprecedented and difficult times and sometimes it’s just about doing whatever gets you through the night. (For me, it’s usually a snack and a glass of wine.) But I’m going to try to go back to some semblance of moderation and a healthy(ish) lifestyle. It’s not so much about the scale or the clothes as it is about just feeling better about my choices. Even with COVID, the world does not appear to be ending immediately and I’d like to be a part of it for a little while longer – especially if I get to keep wearing sweatpants every day."

They have their role to play in controlling troublesome bugs. Sadly, too many people neither like them nor appreciate them and the sight of a spider can quickly turn an arachnophobe into a clumsy tap dancer. Before you know it, they’re hopping and stomping around. That’s not a good move in a garden.  Just saying the word spider can set them off, so I avoid pointing out any plants that have spider connections, and I have at least three in my garden. The smallest is a succulent, Sempervivum arachnoideum. There, the species name should tip anyone off.  The common name might not mention spiders but the sight of a clump of these plants that appear to be covered in spider webs often causes a few wrinkly noses. It’s because of the white, hairy webbing that covers the green rosettes that they’re called Cobweb Hens and Chicks. I have a couple of pots filled with this succulent and, like other hens and chicks, it’s hardy enough to stay outside over winter — providing the pot is. Cleome hassleriana is another plant that might provoke a reaction, by its common name and by its appearance. It’s known as cleome and just as often called spider flower or spider plant. It doesn’t have webs, but the individual flowers do have long, threadlike stamens that resemble the legs of you know what. Even the seed pods can be mistaken for cute little spider bodies. Despite the name, this tall, leggy plant with its large, intricate flowers is excellent in the back of a perennial border. Cleome self-seeds, but never enough to be invasive. Plant it once and it will usually return each year. There are a few varieties that range in colour from white to pink through lilac, and many are bicoloured. If there is a drawback, cleome have slightly thorny stems; however, there are hybrids available like ‘Senorita Rosita’ that are without thorns — except they don’t self-seed. The last in my trio of panic-inducing plants is a summer-flowering bulb called Ismene fetalis, or yes, the white spider lily. This plant is a beauty and mine are flowering now. Ismene aren’t hardy enough to grow year-round in the garden, although they could be planted there for the summer. In a flower bed or a planter or pot, Ismene grow best in moist soil in full sun to part shade. Mine are growing in pots in a rich, well-drained soil and I water them frequently. If the soil is allowed to dry out, there’s a chance the highly fragrant flowers will fail to bloom.  These plants grow from a bulb much like amaryllis and are just as exotic looking. In fact, they’re distantly related and have similar long, straplike leaves. I treat them much the same way as an amaryllis bulb by letting the foliage die naturally. I store the bulbs over winter and start them off again in spring.  Without going into its forebears, this particular Ismene is a hybrid of similar species that grow naturally in South America. Ismene, once a popular girl’s name, is sometimes sold as Hymenocallis and bulbs are usually available in spring. As for that spidery sobriquet, I suppose it’s because of the appearance of the flower, although I can’t see much resemblance myself. The other common name for Ismene is Peruvian daffodil and it does have a look of a raggedy daffodil but with long wispy stamens that, like the cleome, could be seen as spidery. Ignore the name, I say, and appreciate the flowers — and do try to appreciate those other things.

Can I just start carrying a purse and please not have it be a big deal? Are we there yet? Have we, as a society, permitted average, middle-aged, unfashionable, doofussy kind of guys to carry a small bag for our stuff? Honestly, I am struggling. When I go out on errands, I am walking to and from the car with a phone, wallet, glasses case and face mask just as a start.  Often, I am also juggling some or all of lip balm, hand sanitizer, a charging cable, a receipt for something I’m returning to the store, something I’m returning to the store, a pack of gum and a water bottle. This isn’t packing for a two-month wilderness adventure. This is just routine, hey, let’s go shopping kind of stuff.  It’s not so bad in the winter when we wear coats with all kinds of pockets. There are pockets in the sides, pockets on the chest, pockets inside the chest, they’re everywhere. But it’s tough jamming all this stuff in when all I have are my jeans or shorts.  When we go out, my wife grabs her purse, hops in the car and she is ready to roll. I carry my stuff out, try not to drop it, then stick it all in every available door panel, cup holder and console opening I can find. When we get to where we’re going, I have to do it all in reverse.  It’s basically yoga. Or Cirque du Soleil. Watch as I pull a Costco card from my wallet while transferring sunglasses from my face to a case and eyeglasses from a case to my face all while dodging shopping carts and people walking while eating giant ice creams because people at Costco do not have any awareness that there are other people around them. Seriously. I once had to give the, “Ahem. Can we just sneak through here?” to a group of Costco shoppers standing in the middle of an aisle having a chit chat while my daughter and I were trying to carry a bright red canoe past them.  A canoe. Like a full-sized, three-person boat. Didn’t see it. I used to have two solid solutions to my abundance of stuff to carry problem — 1. Cargo pants and 2. Cargo shorts.  I could stuff all of my accessories and necessities into my leg pouches and off I’d go, baggy, saggy but satisfied.  But quite a few years ago, my wife put me in the no-cargo-pant zone.  I don’t even know what the big deal was but one day she vented on me. Like, it got pretty emotional. And it was all about cargo pants and cargo shorts. She didn’t like them and she told me so. She didn’t say it, but I felt like it was a “cargo pants or me” kind of conversation so, of course, I donated my cargo wardrobe and have never purchased pants or shorts with more than five pockets since. Life really is hard. When I go to work, none of this is a big deal. I fit everything into my work bag. It’s not a purse. It’s an over-the-shoulder bag with lots of zippers and pockets for my laptop, cables, iPad, pens, Rolaids, handwipes, a little sanitary mouthguard thingy in case I have to give First Aid to a stranger, my McDonald’s frequent coffee card plus all that other stuff I described above. OK, it’s basically a purse.  But I only carry it when I’m going to work. I don’t think I could carry it through the mall. Why? Why do I feel this way? Am I old? Am I set in my ways? Am I a bad person because I am too hung up to carry a purse? I also don’t believe that I am the only one wrestling with this issue. I can’t be. I’m not the only guy in the world with stuff to carry and not enough pockets to handle the job. If anyone can help me, if anyone has an answer, please let me know. I’ve been carrying this baggage for far too long now. I need something to put it in."
3,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/life/local-history/2020/07/10/flash-from-the-past-famous-20th-century-private-eye-is-rooted-in-kitchener.html,Flash From the Past: Famous 20th century private eye is rooted in Kitchener,['rych mills'],"Fri., July 10, 2020","Which Kitchener author has sold the most books? * Incorrect guesses have ranged from Edna Staebler (Schmecks) to David Morrell (Rambo); from David Chilton (Wealthy Barber) to Mabel Dunham (Trail of the Conestoga). The actual winner isn’t readily recognizable because only four early novels bore his real name — Kenneth Millar. His primary nom-de-plume is more familiar — Ross Macdonald. But his private eye’s name gives the game away — Lew Archer. Through 18 novels, numerous short stories, radio productions and several films (two starring Paul Newman as Lew Harper), Archer became the dominant private investigator during the late 1940s to mid-1970s And Archer’s roots curl back here to Kitchener. Biographies by Tom Nolan, Matthew Bruccoli, Paul Nelson and Kevin Avery cover Millar’s entire career. Each outlines the Kitchener years but Nolan devotes 40 pages to an exhaustive look at Ken’s Kitchener world ... and it’s not a pretty picture. Growing up with dysfunctional, separated parents, Millar (1915-1983) spent several periods in Kitchener, as well as California, Vancouver, Medicine Hat, Winnipeg and Wiarton. In 1920, Annie Moyer Miller brought young Ken to her mother’s house at 32 Brubacher, a dour, repressive environment that Ken evaded as much as possible. Not quite a stereotypical juvenile delinquent, Ken could be labelled a juvenile bookworm delinquent. He frequented pool halls, gambling rooms (yes, even in 1920s Kitchener) as much as bookstores and the Kitchener Public Library (KPL). The most famous story — perhaps apocryphal although I prefer to believe it — combines both sides of his addictions. One day at MacCallum’s billiard parlour/newsstand he discovered a hard-hitting crime novel by Dashiell Hammett. Later, he asked KPL’s Mabel Dunham why Hammett’s books were not stocked. They were, she said, but in a restricted area not accessible to the public. While Ken’s intellectual mind was outraged, his criminal mind was engaged. After closing, he snuck in, found KPL’s restricted area with authors such as Faulkner, Hemingway, Flaubert and Hammett and grabbed an armful. On the way to grandmother’s home, he symbolically dumped them into a sewer. For two years, Ken attended Kitchener Collegiate during which he contributed to the school yearbook, the Grumbler, as both author and literary editor. In 1931, his first published story “South Sea Soup Company” was a Conan Doyle send-up featuring “Herlock Sholmes.” In 1932, he was listed on the Grumbler’s editorial staff and in “Zuider Zee” introduced “Philo France,” to lampoon Philo Vance, a popular New York gumshoe. His final Grumbler story, “To the Damned Their Due,” featured an escaped murderer parachuting from a plane only to perish on hydro wires. After graduating, although motivated by teachers such as Cy Philp and Bill Archer, Ken had no immediate prospects so spent a year working on a farm. Fortunately for his future — and the future of literature — Ken’s feckless father died in May 1933 and his insurance policy bought Ken four years of college. During his sole year at Waterloo College, he contributed numerous articles to the school’s paper The Cord. Realizing that the small college’s faculty knew less than he did, Ken transferred to Western in London for a five-year course in history and English. Again, his knowledge of literature outpaced his professors. The day after graduating from Western, Ken and Kitchenerite Margaret Sturm married and one year later they had a daughter, Linda. Further studies at the University of Michigan led to his doctorate and eventual recognition as one of that university’s all-time outstanding graduate students. Ken and Margaret lived and wrote in California until they died in 1983 and 1994. Three times, they returned to hometown Kitchener, 1948, 1955 and 1971. Locally, only the Kitchener Public and University of Waterloo libraries have circulating copies of Nolan’s book but there are new and used copies on the internet where numerous sites also detail his private and public lives. Although he dropped his surname, it accompanied Ken’s writing career step-by-step: his wife Margaret (Sturm) Millar actually authored more mystery novels than her husband over a longer time, 1941 through 1986. Footnote: * I realize the definition of “Kitchener author” is a moving target: born here? lived here? moved here? educated here? family roots here? Take your pick, but Kenneth Millar can answer yes to four of those five."

This year is different. With lockdown wiping out a third of their 2020 operating hours, the pandemic nearly forced their permanent closure.  “We were done,” says Kristine Mathers, restaurant co-owner. “We had accepted it.” Their location at Sunset Villa, partially obscured by a stone wall, doesn’t attract foot traffic. With fixed monthly costs of four to five figures (exclusive of rent), after temporarily closing, they borrowed money (including receiving the federal Canadian Emergency Business Account loan) to keep afloat.  While the Sunset Villa Association waived three months’ rent, without knowing when or how they could reopen, the restaurant’s owners — Mathers, her brother, Jacob Beck, and his partner, Joanne Moyes — weighed their options. “We’re only two years old and had startup debt; we’re still just making minimum wage doing this,” says Mathers. “Being a small business, it’s all personal debt. We fully decided we were going to have to close.” In one form or another, there’s been a restaurant at Sunset Villa since the 1950s. The association’s board reached out and got a deep dive into the restaurant business before launching a two-week GoFundMe campaign. They raised more than $120,000 by June 1 and then, with the help of a local business owner, reached an agreement allowing the restaurant to reopen for the foreseeable future. “That was absolutely huge for us. We can’t operate out of guilt and passion and all of those wonderful things that drive things forward but then leave us in a ridiculous amount of debt.” Before the pandemic, Canada’s food service sector was expected to grow to $77.5 billion; revised outlooks now predict a precipitous drop, some saying to $38.4 billion (where it was in 2003). Razor-thin margins, sometimes bringing in only a few dollars per table, leave many Canadian restaurants struggling: 10 per cent closed within a couple of weeks of lockdown; currently, 60 per cent operate at a loss and 50 per cent risk permanent closure by summer’s end. There are layers to partially reopening under emergency orders. Without clear official guidelines, The Danish Place owners have turned to industry association Restaurants Canada for information. Additional expenses (disposables, sanitizing supplies, staff) need to be paid for while their 90-seat dining room is closed and patio is reduced to 20 seats. They’re requiring face coverings and physical distancing but returning to work, and increased exposure risk, means friends removed themselves from Mathers’ and her young daughter’s in-person circle.  The Danish Place’s website has detailed instructions on placing orders for pickup and making patio reservations. Right now, they’re open for a few hours on Saturdays and Sundays and they’ve edited their menu to smørrebrød (open-faced sandwiches); hot meals are in the works.  While perfect for a picnic, I grazed on the House Special Platter ($40), a lined cardboard flat that could easily feed four, over a few days. Slices of rye and French bread. Piles of savoury, rustic house-made leverpostej (pâté) with bacon and mushrooms; velvety, fatty rullepølse (cured pork belly) with aspic; tender, sliced frikadelle (meatball); waves of roast beef; gorgeously pongy esrom cheese, and, since I can’t have salmon, little bouncy poached shrimp.  Pots of butter, mayonnaise, vinegary herring, vibrant puce pickled cabbage, mustard-kicked remoulade, and crunchy pickles. Smear the bread, layer the topping and dot with pickle, sliced onions or bell peppers. I’m sure there are rules but when you’re under a tree or at your desk, build and eat your sandwich as you will. That week, they made Jordbærgrød, a lightly sweetened strawberry compote ($6). I ate it as recommended: cold, with a lashing of heavy cream. Summer in a bowl. Navigating the complexities of what used to be and what’s needed now is the hallmark of these Inbetween Times. Hopefully, we will find that sweet spot, because sweet spots like The Danish Place are hard to find.

Apart from my own sites, my byline appeared on well-known ones and now-defunct ones. I authored a white paper for a popular appliance manufacturer. Local and national media interviewed me a few times. I gave talks about food history and appeared on discussion panels on both sides of the border.  After my first Record review ran, a local acquaintance told me I shouldn’t write under my name and every picture of me should be removed from the internet. He didn’t think I should be recognized as the author of my work, although my white colleagues were credited for theirs. I politely ended my reply with, “I’m not easily erased.” He abruptly ended the exchange. I wasn’t surprised. I was born in Kitchener, grew up here, and got my degree from the University of Waterloo. Like other visible minorities, I’m well acquainted with the area’s casual and overt racism: Kids in school called me the N-word. Sales clerks follow me. Restaurant servers try to deny service. We see hate platformed, read gaslighting comments, and hear fauxpologies. Whenever someone demands to know where I’m “really” from, I’m reminded that to some, being Canadian is only skin deep.  That sense of who can and cannot be Canadian is woven into the national fabric. For Canada’s first 100 years, immigration policies prioritized those who could easily blend into colonial culture. Policies and regulations created an unofficial colour bar that throttled immigration from China and India. While not legislated, Wilfrid Laurier’s cabinet approved banning Black immigration. Japanese Canadians’ voting rights were withheld until 1949; Indigenous Peoples didn’t receive universal suffrage until 1982.  Shifting public attitudes of the 1960s led to Lester B. Pearson’s government overhauling our immigration system. Applicants earned points for things such as education, work skills, and language skills; race wasn’t supposed to be a factor. A few years later, in 1971, Pierre Trudeau adopted the Bilingualism and Biculturalism Commission’s recommendation to make multiculturalism national policy.  But reversing a century of systemic racism doesn’t happen overnight.  Black Lives Matter has laid bare deep-seated biases against Black people and other marginalized groups, with conversations turning to how these attitudes flow in the undercurrents of our daily lives: salaries and promotions, social media moderation, how we think about food. I know I’m a rare flower in that I’m a bylined, paid, freelance food writer, who happens to be of South Indian ancestry. This field is traditionally populated by white writers focused on urban, white, bourgeois diners. These writers often elevate certain cuisines to three-star haute status while they devalue immigrant cuisines to cheap eats, particularly when made by immigrant hands. They’ll blur regional foods into Chinese, Latino, and Indian abstractions, and coo over the curiosity of “ethnic” foods, when gentrified or appropriated by white personalities. Contemporary food writing isn’t entirely fogged by exhausted views. Independent voices and staff writers, like some now at The New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, and Food & Wine, don’t necessarily look like, think like, or eat like their predecessors and are more reflective of their communities and generations. While some continue the aspirational chase for “the best places,” others unearth compelling stories in tasty places. Condescending eyes aren’t cast on diasporic cuisines or their labour. Restaurants and chefs previously fawned over aren’t automatically slid easy praise.  Change is difficult, especially after decades of magazines, newspapers, radio, and TV reinforcing cultural biases. Some eaters are flummoxed with opinions, voices, or faces that don’t fit the old mould. Without reading my work, a woman told me I’m unqualified to write about “white people’s food” because I wasn’t raised on it. When I said that must also mean white people who weren’t raised eating Japanese, Chinese, Thai and other non-European cuisines weren’t qualified to write about them, she mumbled something and walked away.  I’ve been told restaurants in Waterloo’s University District — a young area, chockablock with diasporic cuisines often cooked by non-white hands — aren’t “worthy” of review. Patronizing comments like “who can eat this?” echo sentiments about stinky, spicy, unclean foreign foods. My foodways writing spotlights cuisines our neighbours bring with them, but some insist those aren’t “the most important” ones. As one person said, “we don’t eat like this.”  But we do.  More than 50 years after immigration reforms, Waterloo Region’s population includes more than 220 ethnicities and one in five of us identify as a visible minority. How we think of ourselves should evolve with our community. How we tell today’s stories — from business to arts to sports to culture to food — should reflect who we are now. Not who we were in the decades before I was born. Not who those in far-off glass towers think we are.  We may not have eaten like this in 1950, but we do eat like this in 2020. Because that’s who we really are."

My mother would vacuum my room as I lay there, apparently in her way. And my dad would hose off the exterior of my bedroom window as a supposed part of his weekend morning home maintenance routine. The sound of a water jet hitting glass is quite startling, if you were wondering. We have taken a more relaxed approach to parenting around here, although I had a very difficult time not jumping up and down on my daughter’s bed the Saturday morning that we planned to order in brunch from the Korner Kitchen. It was all part of some special mother/daughter time I had been scheduling to try to add a little cheer to the week that should have included her prom.  The two of us had eaten at their appealing new restaurant in Waterloo on what became her last day of high school, and nearly the restaurant’s last day being open for regular business. It felt like coming full circle when I called to put in our order and discovered they were hoping to soon reopen their patio for diners. We are big fans of breakfast in this family and Korner Kitchen has just the menu for us. They also have plenty of lunch items, along with daily specials. I dithered a bit over the menu because I couldn’t decide between sweet and savoury. A day without maple syrup is like a day without sunshine, but I ended up with the best of both worlds when my daughter and I added a Belgian waffle ($8.29) to share as a side. We definitely ordered more than we could eat, but I knew we would enjoy the leftovers. I was very happy with my choice of the Canadian Eggs Benedict ($13.50). It derives its name from the inclusion of pea meal, or Canadian bacon, which is layered with poached egg and melted cheddar cheese, all on top of a toasted English muffin and smothered with delicious Hollandaise sauce. It was tasty and satisfying, and came with two side dishes. The hash brown potatoes at Korner Kitchen are a thing of beauty. The potatoes are grated nice and thin, salted and cooked to crispy perfection. I also had the fruit salad, which was quite large and incorporated two types of melon, three types of berries, bananas, kiwi fruit, pineapple, and grapes. My daughter’s BLT Deluxe Sandwich ($10.50) was so generously sized that the sides of hash brown potatoes and baked beans had to go into a separate container. The sandwich was made with bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, smashed avocado, two fried eggs and garlic mayo, all between toasted whole-wheat bread. She also really enjoyed the hash browns and smaller portion of baked beans. The waffle we shared was light, airy and accompanied by a whipped topping. I added my own maple syrup, of course. The final dish we sampled was the Berry Salad ($16.95). I was looking to add a little fresh greens to our meal and it didn’t disappoint. This salad is a satisfying meal in itself — and came with a grilled breast of chicken on the side. There are plenty of toppings including berries, toasted sliced almonds, pieces of walnut, crumbled goat cheese and I chose a balsamic vinaigrette for my dressing.  Last but not least, we each ordered a Tropical White Herbal Tea ($3.25). I would describe it as having the aroma and flavour of a delicious island-themed cocktail, but in tea form. The other three members of my family are not going to read this review with quite the same enthusiasm as my daughter and I felt eating our brunch, but they can rest assured we will be ordering in again soon from Korner Kitchen.

The rest of the list — miso soup, pad Thai, bubble tea and edamame — tells a story of how we’re eating now: More than half of us born after the mid-1960s were already used to scrolling and clicking to fill our bellies before March. Also, surveys reveal the younger we are, the more likely we’ll fill our plates with foods our parents and grandparents won’t eat. It seems as our understandings and experiences broaden, so do our palates. A friend and I have a decade-long on-again-off-again conversation about Indian restaurants. I grew up eating the best South Indian food in Waterloo Region — note: my mum’s cooking is the best. That’s not up for debate — while my friend is giddily incandescent about a place that’s … lacking. A few months ago, she shoved a takeout menu for Sahar’s Kitchen into my hand and implored, “This place is so much better. You have to try it. You have to.” It was like she switched from Android to iPhone, Coke to Pepsi, the Leafs to, well, anyone.  Sahar’s Kitchen’s familiar collection of foods hopscotches across the Indian subcontinent. Along with those rooted in Bengali, Chettiar, Goan, Mughlai and Pakistani traditions, others are from the Anglo-Indian canon. With a family story that stretches from Pakistan to Bangladesh to Hong Kong, Majid Maqbool joined his wife, Jhorna, in Kitchener in 2015. Before this, he was cooking at a family restaurant in Hong Kong.  The plan was always to return to the restaurateur life here. Two years ago they opened, naming their restaurant after their now four-year-old daughter — Sahar means dawn’s light. Here, the couple, along with Mian Maqbool Sabry (Majid’s father), turn out some fine dishes from the cosy restaurant’s kitchen.  Unlidding containers reveals complex aromas and flavours buoyed by texture and colour. Rivulets of brick red oils swirl atop luscious crimson and russet gravies. Spices speckle pallid sweet sauces. Textures wander from firm to sticky to voluptuously soft. The Butter Chicken’s ($15.99) chunks of breast meat are tender and swathed in a rounded, rich, tomato gravy. Unlike the tinned tomato soupiness that’s sometimes found elsewhere, its light sweetness doesn’t overpower. The King Prawn Chettinad ($17.99) is punchy with a pleasantly creeping heat that doesn’t overpower. The gravy’s depth is boosted from the firm tail-on shrimp — here, the gravy is to be sopped up.  For okra fans, the Bhindi Bhaji ($14.99) combines firm and slippery chunks with slithers of silky onion, fried in mild spices. There’s a mild tang to the Bharta’s ($14.99) soft mash of grilled eggplant from the tomato masala.  Mixing the wet and dry dishes into the nutty, aromatic Basmati ($3.99), jeera rice flecked with grains of saffron rice, brings everything together. The soft, bubbly Garlic Naan ($3.99) — blistered from the tandoor and scattered with chopped garlic and coriander — is perfect for sopping up puddles of gravy. Soaked in sweetened rosewater-scented cream, the Rasmalai’s ($2.99) cheesecake-like paneer is moreish. And whether you call it kheer, payasam or Rice Pudding ($2.99), the loose, butter yellow pudding is flavoured with cardamom and studded with cashews. Both are needed desserts for hot nights. There was a well-spaced queue of customers and delivery drivers spilling onto the sidewalk when I picked up dinner. Business has been steady throughout COVID-19 and I can see why. The Maqbools turn out tasty, fresh-made foods in Kitchener to satisfy faraway cravings.

8,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/life/food-wine/review/2020/06/11/dining-in-gayuma-catering-serves-asian-fusion-from-the-heart.html,Dining In: Gayuma Catering serves Asian fusion from the heart,['Alex Bielak'],"Thu., June 11, 2020","Given the positive online buzz about Gayuma Catering’s takeout Asian fusion dishes, and how fast they sold out, I was delighted when I finally successfully placed an order. Everything about the place seemed happy, from the jaunty logo, incorporating chopsticks and noodles into the letter G, to the upbeat social media posts, often featuring the radiant owners.  Katrina Tioco came from the Philippines in 2006 as a caregiver, and still has family there she supports financially. She eventually worked as a nanny for Canadian-born Jinny Song, whose ancestry is South Korean. That’s how Song came to appreciate just how good a cook Tioco is.  Two years ago, Song convinced Tioco to do some food pop-ups at the bubble tea shop she manages. She was certain people would love her now-friend’s cooking, saying “I really wanted to get her food out there. She never believed in herself, but I did. She’s the sister I never had.”  Not long thereafter, they started Gayuma, originally catering to tech sector companies. With corporate offices closed because of COVID-19, they lost all their clients. “We still had family to support and rent to pay, so we changed our business model very quickly, beginning with a Facebook post. It was slow in the beginning: the first week we had just 10 orders, but it grew each week and we are now at capacity every weekend. We are so grateful. In a way, it was a blessing in disguise.”  Tioco says her grandfather served as the inspiration for the name Gayuma. During the ’60s, impatient customers lined up at his restaurant, pressing him to tell them what made his food so special and worth the wait. He told them he cooked everything from scratch, with all his heart, and that was why they were there. The Filipino word Gayuma, “that which attracts,” encapsulated his offerings.  She says that is the way she cooks now. “I can’t speed it up, and people are so patient with me. I decide what to cook once I’m at the grocery store. And I’ve had to accommodate all sorts of allergies, so have had to find alternative ingredients that can work in the dishes to substitute for things like peanuts. Guided by her grandmother during Facebook chats, she’s found various Asian herbs and seeds that can serve as replacements, while keeping the dishes tasting right.”  Dodging summer downpours, I picked up my order at the back of a small strip mall off Weber Street. A small sign by a nondescript door directed me to call to get my order. Once the door opened, there, above the masks, were those same smiling eyes I had seen on Facebook. I was the last client of the day, so the ladies had time to chat before closing.  Tioco’s actual sister — another radiant smile beaming from the back of the store — was responsible for folding each of the 20 dumplings that comprised part of our order. Half beef, half pork, with garlic, shallots, salt and pepper, they were delicious in Tioco’s signature, a beautifully clear and garlicky, 48-hour chicken soup. The accompanying ginger soy sauce also provided contrasting flavour.  Song told me that Chap Chae is a sweet potato glass noodle Korean dish, more savoury than spicy. She said Tioco makes it better than she can, adding the highest of praise, “it’s like my mother’s.” The ground beef was marinated overnight with sesame oil, soya sauce, brown sugar, crushed garlic and pepper, before being sautéed with green onion and added to the noodles. A small container of brought-in Sriracha allowed for a bit of heat for those so inclined. I could frankly have done with the protein being a bit more prominent among the other ingredients — peppers, carrot, shiitake mushrooms, spinach and sesame seeds — but that is the merest of quibbles.  The copious and truly satisfying meal — consciously made affordable by Tioco and Song to give back to the community during COVID — was most enjoyable. Everyone was keen to order again, and I’ll certainly be watching out for what is on offer each week, and for what the future holds for these joyful entrepreneurs.

9,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/life/travel/2020/07/10/pandemic-has-travellers-rediscovering-the-open-road-and-camper-vans.html,"Pandemic has travellers rediscovering the open road, and camper vans",['Mike SeelyThe New York Times'],"Fri., July 10, 2020","Harley Sitner was in  Brooklyn for a wedding in March, feeling as if he’d just been sprayed by a skunk. Sitner’s hometown, Seattle, where he owns a camper-van restoration, repair and rental business called Peace Vans, was the site of one of one of the first huge coronavirus outbreaks. “People were like, ‘Stay away,’” he recalled. Back home, with peak road-trip season approaching, his employees reported a rush of cancellations on rental vans. Sitner had just hired a “super-awesome” marketing manager and began thinking he might have to lay her off. School was cancelled, and all but the most essential businesses were ordered to shut down. Sitner was compelled to give his employees a month off, save for a skeletal crew that stuck around to perform essential services like repairs. “We were looking at some pretty significant revenue black holes,” he said. Then, in mid-April, the phone started ringing in the repair shop. “People started thinking they’d have a summer and wanted their classic Volkswagens looked at,” Sitner said. But it wasn’t just that. There was also a run on a new line of modern camper vans his company had announced with Mercedes-Benz at the Chicago Auto Show in February: produced by a third-party manufacturer called Driverge, sleeping four apiece, and starting at $93,000 without kitchen and cabinetry, $120,000 with. “We sold like 28 of them in 30 days,” Sitner said. “Some people are saying they’re not getting on a plane for two years or never going to Europe again.” Sitner is 52, with a 10-year-old daughter named Eden Peach. In person, he projects a tender, Michael Stipe-ish vibe, wistfully remembering that “until recently, we hugged so many of our customers” and brewed espresso in the shop’s front office. He became acquainted with Peace Vans as a customer, running his Vanagon (a.k.a. the Volkswagen T3) in and out of the shop, in Seattle’s industrial SoDo neighbourhood, between jaunts to Burning Man. In 2013 he learned from the shop owner that he planned to close the business, and Sitner persuaded him to hand it over instead. Over the years, Sitner has served clientele from aging hippies to Instagramming millennials, and all political persuasions. (In the lot of Peace Vans there was an old VW bus from Iowa awaiting restoration with a National Rifle Association sticker on the driver’s-side window and a painting of the word “Peace” on the side panel.) But the venture with Mercedes, which began casually after he began buying the chassis of the brand’s Metris van from a dealership down the street, has brought a new kind of buyer, Sitner said. Ed Stevens, a 51-year-old tech entrepreneur in Dallas, had planned to take his wife, Robin, and two adult children scuba diving in the Caribbean when the pandemic took hold. The virus’s spread, he said, was the reason he started looking to buy a camper van. “We cancelled the reservation and hunkered down, and then I started thinking, ‘I can work from anywhere, Robin’s taking a class online, and we thought we’d just cruise the whole country,” he said. “As soon as I saw the official partnership between Mercedes and Harley, that was the motivating factor.” (“The idea of building on a Nissan or a Ford light van did not meet the quality bar we wanted,” Sitner said, explaining his choice of chassis.) Mark and Linda Kimlin had just spent the winter in Spain before returning to New York City in mid-March, feeling “very lucky to escape unscathed,” said Mark Kimlin, 63. But New York was itself about to get scathed, and with the lease up on their Upper East Side apartment, the Kimlins hightailed it to a home they owned in New Paltz, north of the city. (They expect to return to the city when things “settle down,” Linda Kimlin, 65, said.) Their daughter had planned to get married in California in July (the celebration has been postponed, although not the ceremony) and, Mark Kimlin said, “it seemed like a good time for wide-open spaces and not getting on an airplane.” His son-in-law-to-be had driven a simpler version of the Metris camper van and shared his positive experience with Kimlin, who bought one from Peace Vans on the strength of that recommendation and the fact that his wife “likes camping, but with a comfy bed.” Talk to any camper-van owner and they’ll tout the relatively small size of their vehicles compared to traditional RVs and the taller Mercedes Sprinter vans that many Amazon delivery drivers whiz around in, explaining that the more compact Mercedes Metris and VW Vanagons are easily usable as second cars in dense neighbourhoods in major metropolitan areas. But they’re also great for when a wildfire jumps the highway and bears down on your house — the precise scenario Naomi Neilson stared down in mid-June at her house in Shell Beach, California. “Everyone was like, ‘Where are you going to go?’ And I was like, ‘I don’t know, I’m going to take my van and go,” said Neilson, 46, who owns a Metris camper van and runs a bathroom-fixture company called Native Trails. “I just threw some food and drinks in the fridge and was ready to go. It took me 10 minutes. I went down the coast a little way and just relaxed. I didn’t end up needing to evacuate for the whole night, but it was nice to be able to just throw a couple things in there and know I had a place to sleep and cook for as long as I needed.” Of course, this is something owners of Volkswagen Vanagons have taken comfort in for decades. While Metris owners like Ed Stevens never considered buying such a lovable relic of hippie culture because he “didn’t want to be spending two days somewhere while my transmission gets shipped in from God knows where,” VW owners like Brian Kolonick of Cleveland think the hassle’s worth it because, he said, “my kids think I’m cool for a minute.” “It’s the way it smells, the way it drives, the way people look at you — you’re bringing them some level of joy,” said Kolonick, 42, who works in digital health for a company called Conversa in Portland, Oregon. He rented a Vanagon from Sitner before he bought one and said some VW scenesters turn their nose up at him because he “can’t repair things” and has to call a mechanic. He’ll often visit Vanagon forums online, where he occasionally finds diehards dissing the Subaru engines in some custom conversions, arguing that they’re “taking away from the slow-running intensity” of the stock motor. And it’s fair to surmise that some VW devotees think Metris owners are a tad soft. “We have friends who have them, and I’ve got to admit, we joke about their vans,” said Jim Samuel, 58, a real estate agent and University of Oregon grad in Seattle who named his 1991 Vanagon “Bertha,” after the Grateful Dead song. “But it comes down to people, ultimately.” Joayne Andrews agrees. A 72-year-old retiree, she lives in Cathedral City, California, just east of Palm Springs, and has owned 26 Volkswagens in her lifetime, four of them vans. A Jetta is her daily ride, but when she really wants to get away, she’s got a 2000 Eurovan at home and an ’82 Westfalia stashed in Seattle that Sitner’s crew has been restoring for the past two years. When she visits friends up and down the West Coast, she thinks her vans make her a better houseguest. “It’s nice to be able to pull into their driveway and not take up space in their house,” she said. “We’ve got our own little studio apartment.” As for the Metris campers, her neighbour has one, and Andrews thinks “they’re lovely.” She then added, “They’re superexpensive, but probably with what I had to have my van restored, I could have bought one.”"
10,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/life/travel/2020/07/10/two-nature-hot-spots-in-southwestern-ontario-to-plan-for-this-summer.html,Two nature hot spots in southwestern Ontario to plan for this summer,"['Chris EarleySpecial to the Toronto Star', 'Tracy C. Read']","Fri., July 10, 2020","Thames Valley Trail allows you to explore nature in the rural countryside and in the heart of a large city. The Thames Valley Trail follows a meandering 130-kilometre path along the Thames River, one of southern Ontario’s major waterways. The river’s three main branches — known today as the North, Middle and South Thames. The trail follows these branches through diverse habitats in the Carolinian Forest Region, in which a wide range of plant species thrive. In spring, populations of trilliums and other wildflowers explode in the forests, while the pungent smell of early-blooming skunk cabbage permeates the air in swampy wetlands. In open areas, you’ll find everything from meadow herbs to cultivated crops. The North Branch and South Branch meet at The Forks in the heart of the City of London, and flow through downtown parks. Thanks to these green spaces, urban wildlife, from rabbits and groundhogs to white-tailed deer and coyotes, flourish. The sight of an eastern spiny softshell turtle sunning itself along the muddy banks is a special treat. With its pancake-shaped leathery shell and long, pointed nose, this threatened reptile is extremely distinctive. Much of its habitat has been lost to shoreline development, so Ontario’s softshells are left to depend on sites like the Thames to survive. There are many spots from which hikers can access the trail along its length. Start at London’s Ivey Park, follow the river northward to Harris Park, and then cross the river at Blackfriars Street. Wander the opposite bank back south to Riverside Park. Kensington Bridge returns you to your starting point. The St. Williams Conservation Reserve is part of the Norfolk Sand Plain, a delta that formed on the northern shore of Lake Erie after the retreat of the last ice age’s glaciers. Early pioneers eventually settled much of this land, clear-cutting populations of native trees and plants over time and exposing the sandy soil to the elements. The St. Williams Forestry Project was established more than a century ago to grow and plant seedlings in an effort to stabilize what had effectively become desert areas. As one of the first projects in Canada, it serves as a model for subsequent initiatives. Made up of oak woodland, oak savannah, forest, wet- lands and sand barrens, the St. Williams Conservation Reserve is located on Crown land within the Long Point Biosphere Preserve. With more than 1,000 hectares at two sites, the reserve is a multi-use area that supports a great number of Canadian species at risk. Today, it is being managed to restore and preserve the richly diverse Carolinian habitats and flora and fauna populations that once flourished here. While exploring the trails, keep your eye open for one of Ontario’s most beautiful and endangered woody plants, the eastern flowering dogwood. This small tree is alive with large blooms in May. Interestingly, the white “petals” on the four-parted flowers are not petals at all but bracts, a leaf-like structure that has taken on the petal’s job of attracting pollinators with their showy colour. The familiar poinsettia and bougainvillea plants share the same characteristic. Another St. Williams denizen to watch for is the eastern hog-nosed snake. When attacked, it hisses, makes a striking motion, flattens its neck and even plays dead. It’s a harmless display intended to discourage potential predators. Unfortunately, in recent years, this snake has moved from threatening to threatened as its population has declined; a research project at St. Williams is focused on how to preserve this intriguing Ontario species."
11,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/life/health_wellness/2020/07/13/i-did-yoga-in-a-plastic-pod-during-a-heat-wave.html,I did yoga in a plastic pod during a heat wave,['Serena WilloughbyToronto Star'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","There are pod people among us. They come from across the city and congregate near the lakeshore. Inside the pods, their bodies, lithe and slick with sweat, twist and contort with synchronicity, hived-off from the dangers of the pandemic. Like hamsters inside invisible wheels that go nowhere, they do mountain climbers, jacks, burpees, sweating singularly, inside the safety of their pods. No, this is not “The X-Files.” This is Lmnts Outdoor Studio  at Stanley Barracks near Hotel X at Exhibition Place. It’s yoga, Pilates and other fitness classes inside a clear plastic dome, one person per dome, 50 domes available per class. The idea is that it allows for safe, socially distanced classes with the benefits of a hot room. Those who are used to the benefits of practising in a hot room haven’t had the opportunity since yoga studios closed in March due to COVID-19. The clear plastic domes are large enough for one person, and their mat, towel and water. It creates a greenhouse effect, light and heat go in but don’t go out. Domes are preassigned and classes are prepaid, so there’s no wandering around looking for a spot, potentially spreading germs around. Everyone has their temperature taken as they go in and entry is controlled so everyone always keeps a safe distance. My first class was called “Full Body Sweat,” described as “full body circuits involving bodyweight, light resistance training and cardio.” I was worried about visibility but since the domes are clear and the teachers are elevated on a stage, you can see everything.  It was an intense workout, fast-paced with lots of cardio, working out different areas; arms, legs and abs. I was sore the next day, always a sign of a good workout but though I haven’t been in a hot studio since March, I found the heat totally manageable.  But I was really looking forward to the “Original Hot Yoga” class I had scheduled for the following day. I wanted the sequence with which I’m familiar. For this class my dome was in the shade, but since it was during a heat wave, and it was high noon it was still hot, (though I could have handled hotter.) I’ve been practising hot yoga in various forms for more than 15 years and I’ve found it’s improved my chronic back pain by promoting flexibility. I love the heat and find health benefits in sweating it out. So while I’ve been doing Zoom classes in my living room, the opportunity to get in a hot room, or something like it, was appealing. But what I didn’t realize I missed the most was my yoga community. I’ve been going to Beaches Hot Yoga for about five years and I take Inferno Hot Pilates, a HIIT (high intensity interval training) class that uses Pilates principles, as well as Hot Yoga, a series of 26 postures with two breathing exercises. Teachers there know me, they know my injuries, they know what weights I should be using and where in the room I like to put my mat. And when you go to the same classes each week, you start to know your fellow students and you develop friendships that go beyond talking about yoga and Pilates. As I settled into my dome I spotted someone I recognized from my Beaches studio. She wasn’t someone I ever talked to but I knew the face and wondered if she recognized me. I never managed to get her attention, and we were asked not to congregate after the class, but I realized that I was missing that interaction. And being in a dome, in a sea of domes just makes the sense of isolation we’re all feeling, all the more palpable. Like if something is completely off-limits you can accept that, but if it’s just out of reach, it bothers you more. Which made me sad, but maybe I’m just not a pod person. Or, as my teacher for that class Melanie Chung explained, it’s not about one-on-one connections, it’s about collective energy. “Energy is one of the most beautiful things about yoga,” she said. She says she picks up on the collective energy when she sees people are listening and following her cues. Whether in a hot room, or with the pods, she tries to get that connection to help her gauge skill levels, and she can tell when people are tuned in. So for my next class, “Hot HIIT Pilates” I tried to focus on the idea of collective energy.  It was 32C that day, the sun was high in the sky, the air was still. It was hot. Though the heat didn’t intimidate me in the first two classes, now I was worried. All of the pods have a fan though and I turned mine on low to get a little air flow. And as soon as the class started there was no time to worry about being hot.  As I tried to keep up amid the sequences of walk-outs, bridges, bicycles and lunges, I looked around at my fellow pod people. It was tough and sweaty and we were all just working as hard as we could. Some people went outside their domes and just found a spot on the grass. The class went by quickly and as I lingered in my pod to do some stretches, I saw smiles on every face as they departed. Being pushed to a physical limit creates the sense that you’ve been through something, that we were all challenged and prevailed. Perhaps this was the collective energy I was seeking. And perhaps it’s true as they teach in yoga, no matter where you are or the lengths you take to stay safe, each one of us is creating our own reality as well as the collective reality—inside and outside the pod."
12,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/life/health_wellness/2020/07/13/meredith-shaw-is-bringing-body-positivity-to-food-television.html,Meredith Shaw is bringing body positivity to food television,['Lara BucharThe Kit'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","The body positivity movement has made waves in the worlds of fashion and beauty in recent years, but one industry where it’s noticeably missing? Food television.  Style expert Meredith Shaw and her partner, chef Rodney Bowers, are out to change that with their new self-shot cooking series, “Double Your Dish,” where they transform one base ingredient into two totally different dishes in their home kitchen. While Rodney takes the lead on the cooking side, Meredith flexes her food styling and sous chef skills, and also acts as camera operator.  Beyond the delicious food, the series is noteworthy because it signals a shift in the types of bodies that are seen on television, particularly food television. “It’s pretty cool to have a cooking show with two people in bigger bodies because I don’t think you see that very much,” says Shaw. Bowers’ experience backs that up: “In the past, I was told that I wouldn’t have my own cooking show because of my size, that it’s not something that networks or sponsors want.” Where do you see the intersection between body positivity and love of cooking? Shaw: Society puts a lot of guilt on enjoying food. I hope that through the food that we make, and the style that we do it in and our passion for what we’re doing, it allows for that intersection to be even stronger and to provide actual examples of it happening in real time. Bowers: I’ve worked on many different television shows over the years as a guest cooking expert and I was often met with negative comments about being a larger man even when I was cooking healthier food. There was a weird dichotomy between a large man cooking and promoting healthier food. It sat with me for a while and I questioned how to deal with it, because I wanted to promote good, healthy, organic, balanced eating for everyone. On the flip side of that, when I would cook with lots of butter and meat, I’d get negative comments … associated specifically with my weight. I think it’s so important for people in larger bodies to show that food can be good and dynamic and tasty and healthy and fun. It doesn’t have to be associated with their body image. It can just be food that they’re cooking. What kinds of recipes do you prepare on ‘Double Your Dish’? Shaw: The series was inspired by our Instagram Lives in our kitchen, when we were preparing meals together. Once we were offered the show, we sat down, cracked a bottle of wine and said, “What do we want to cook? What do we want to show? What do we want to share with the country? What would be useful? What would be personal?” Rodney uses really simple, accessible ingredients and makes them so delicious, and shows that I — and the viewers at home — can do it, too. Meredith, you’ve done a lot of great work for the body positivity moment. How did that start? Shaw: I have always been in a bigger body and there was no word for that when I was growing up. There was no “curvy,” there was no sort of activism; it was “big-boned” or “fat.” I started off as a singer-songwriter and I had many a meeting with record executives — which I hope don’t happen now — where they’d say, “We love your voice, we love your song, but we basically don’t like what you look like.” That was hard to handle. I had a tough journey with it and I went down the wrong path for a while. I tried to be less than, tried to be smaller, and it didn’t work for me. That’s why I have such empathy and passion for helping other women through that, because it’s so much better on your own team. It’s so much better to love your body and to know that you are more than your body, and to know that your worth isn’t tied to the size of your body. Rodney, have you had similar experiences? Bowers: I think the anxiety and depression that can come with being overweight affects men as well. I definitely struggle with self-image when we’re talking about cooking food on TV. Producers have told me that it all came down to an image thing and it turned me off for a while, thinking that no matter how I present myself on camera there’s always going to be this stigma about my size that other people are going to hold me back for. But then you get over it and you prove them wrong. Meredith, how did your experiences propel your work as a fashion expert? Shaw: I think you can really express yourself with style; it’s a way of stepping into your purpose. If your closet is full of things that don’t fit and make you feel bad and shameful when you open it, get rid of that stuff and stock it with new things. I scream that from the rooftops as often as I can. I come at my role as a style expert from a real place of love and empathy as a result of my own experiences. How does that come into play on ‘Double Your Dish’? Shaw: The show is important in terms of that visibility for both men and women. Rodney is a superhot dude and I have him in great clothes on the show. He’s in bright, fashionable, co-ordinated looks that fit him well. These aren’t clothes that fade into the background. He’s owning it and conquering it, which I think is really inspiring."

Researchers from the Ottawa Hospital say they want to explore the potential of IMM-101, a preparation featuring a dead pathogen containing properties that can stimulate the “first-response arm” of the immune system. Study lead Dr. Rebecca Auer, surgical oncologist and director of cancer research at the Ottawa Hospital, says it could help experts understand why some COVID-19 patients are relatively asymptomatic while others end up in intensive care or die. “The difference, it seems, between these two different presentations has to do with how strong your innate, or your sort of non-specific, first-line defence immune system response is to the virus,” Auer said Wednesday. “And so we’re hoping that by boosting and stimulating this innate immune response, particularly in those vulnerable patients that have a reduced immune response to begin with, we’d be able to prevent symptomatic infections and prevent serious infections.” Cancer patients are at much higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19 because chemotherapy, cancer surgery and radiation treatments suppress innate immunity even further. Auer points to an “urgent need” to protect them while the world waits for an effective COVID-19 vaccine, which could take another year or more to develop, test and implement. A successful trial could also protect cancer patients against other respiratory infections as well as the coming flu season, says Auer, noting the threat of illness is a fairly big problem for those undergoing treatment. “A study demonstrated that about 13 to 15 per cent of cancer patients will have to delay or stop their treatment because of influenza during the average flu season,” she says. “And also, cancer patients don’t respond as well to the influenza vaccine every year because their immune system isn’t as strong. So we think that the IMM-101 may in itself be able to help prevent symptomatic influenza infections.” Auer says IMM-101 has also been tested elsewhere for its anti-cancer properties and that, too, will be examined in this trial, although it’s not the primary objective. The researchers say the bacteria, Mycobacterium obuense, is safe to use in cancer patients because it has been killed by heat. The Canadian study will recruit 1,500 patients currently receiving cancer treatment, and participants will be randomly assigned to receive either regular care or regular care plus IMM-101. Auer says the treatment would be administered as an injection in the arm, to be followed by two more booster shots. Researchers will follow patients for a year, watching for any respiratory infections and monitoring whether the treatment works and how long it lasts. The trials will take place in eight centres located in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec. Researchers say people interested in participating should speak with their cancer specialist. Researchers from the Ottawa Hospital came up with the idea and worked with the Canadian Cancer Trials Group at Queen’s University to design the trial. Dr. Chris O’Callaghan of the Queen’s University group notes cancer patients are also at greater risk of COVID-19 infection because they require regular medical care, making it difficult to adhere fully to public health guidelines. “These patients are unable to practise social isolation due to the need to regularly attend hospital to receive critically important cancer treatment,” says O’Callaghan, who will oversee the trial. Auer says a successful trial of IMM-101 could also suggest usefulness in treating any patient with a reduced innate immune system, such as older patients with chronic illness. She notes that the tuberculosis vaccine known as BCG — which uses a similar formulation to IMM-101 but uses live bacteria instead of dead bacteria — is being tested around the world to see if it can boost the immunity of health-care workers exposed to COVID-19. Funding and in-kind support, valued at $2.8 million, comes from the Canadian Cancer Society, BioCanRx, the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, the Ottawa Hospital Foundation, the Ottawa Hospital Academic Medical Organization, ATGen Canada/NKMax and Immodulon Therapeutics, the manufacturer of IMM-101."

That said, its popularity has been subject to the usual ups and downs associated with drink trends and, from about 1970 to 2010, it was a little less common, since many people had turned to vodka, rum and tequila cocktails like the Margarita, Piña Colada and Cosmopolitan. And, as often happens with drinks that aren’t in regular circulation, the quality of the Manhattans started to decline as a lot of bartenders simply forgot how to make one properly. It’s an easy drink to make—whisky, sweet vermouth, bitters, stirred over ice and served in a cold glass with or without a cherry—but a lot of things can go wrong if you don’t understand a few basics. First, like all drinks that are made with straight spirits, it needs to be stirred, so that it doesn’t wind up watery. Second, the bitters are essential. Third, splurge on a good Amarena cherry. Fourth, vermouth goes bad relatively quickly if it isn’t stored in the refrigerator. Finally, don’t be stingy with the vermouth. Unless, that is, you’ve left your vermouth on a counter for a month, which was exactly what happened at a lot of bars in the vodka/tequila era. On top of that, a lot of people forgot the bitters since, even though a bottle of Angostura bitters sat on the back bar of many venues like a talisman or something, few of us understood how to use them. Bitters are often called the “salt and pepper” of the cocktail world and bartenders say that, quite often, if something is just a little off on a drink and they can’t figure out what, a dash of bitters will fix it. These problems have largely been fixed in the past 10 to 15 years, thanks to the revival of traditional methods amongst bartenders who have been bringing back the classics. Speaking of tradition, the first Manhattans would almost universally have been made with American rye whiskey but, since we’re doing 100-mile cocktails here and supporting local distilleries, we’re using a Canadian alternative, Stalk and Barrel’s Three Barrel Whisky ($34.95; LCBO 13323). Since it’s made just north of Toronto, we named it after the distillery’s location—in Concord. The Concord 2 oz Stalk and Barrel whisky ¾ oz Haberdasher sweet vermouth (made in Prince Edward County) 2 dashes Angostura bitters 1 Amarena cherry (for garnish) Method: Stir all ingredients (except the cherry) together over ice in a mixing glass for 45 seconds. Strain into a chilled coupe or martini glass. Add cherry. NOTE: If you have trouble tracking down Haberdasher, Dillon’s Vermouth (also made in Ontario) is an alternative that’s available at the LCBO. And there are plenty of Ontario craft whisky options, but we wanted to shine a light on Stalk and Barrel, the province’s oldest micro-distillery, because it’s celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. They have several different expressions, including a rye and a single malt."
15,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/life/food_wine/advice/2020/07/09/yes-you-can-drink-wine-on-the-rocks-plus-one-to-chill-you-might-not-expect.html,"Yes, you can drink wine on the rocks (plus one to chill you might not expect)",['Carolyn Evans HammondContributing Columnist'],"Thu., July 9, 2020","I’m just going to say it: Yes, you can drink wine on the rocks. But there’s a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. Here’s the lowdown. When you don’t care that the ice will dilute the wine as it melts, or that the deep chill is going to mask all the subtle complexity in the wine, go ahead and toss a few cubes in the glass. Otherwise, refrain. My bet is, if you’ve dropped a generous bundle of cash on a bottle of fine wine, you’re not going to want to wreck it by watering it down and muting it. Which is why serving fine wine on the rocks is not usually a good idea. But there’s one exception. And that’s Port. That sweet, fortified wine from Portugal that’s typically associated with Christmas gifting, by-the-fire sipping and post-dinner cheese boards is actually quite fabulous in the summer served on ice. Especially with a dish of salted almonds. Here’s why it works. First off, Port is so concentrated that a little dilution isn’t going to kill the experience. In fact, it will actually enhance its drinkability. Secondly, ice ratchets up the refreshment factor and offsets the style’s considerable sweetness. And third, at about 20 per cent alcohol by volume, Port is a slow sipper. So it has time to warm up a little bit in your mouth as you drink it, giving the considerable complexity time to open, cascade and linger — even when served cold. All that to say, if you haven’t tried Port on the rocks, I’d encourage you to do so with a bottle of white, tawny or ruby Port. Here are a few favourites that offer tremendous value. White wine lovers will appreciate Taylor Fladgate NV Fine White Port (Vintages 69856, $15.95/750mL). Gleaming golden in the glass, this is a sweet, full-bodied wine made from a blend of eight white grape varieties and aged in wood for three years. Each sip saturates the palate with a blast of candied pear and orange zest, salted caramel and hazelnut, vanilla and a whisper of nutmeg. This is especially good served with a slice of orange in the glass. Score: 93 A tasty tawny to try is Warre’s Otima 10-Year-Old (LCBO 566174, $22.00/500mL). Tawny Ports are red fortified wines that have shed their deep ruby colour and turned amber, or tawny, from maturing in wood for an extended time. This version, comprised of wine aged an average of 10 years in oak, shines a deep amber hue and tastes of toffee and nuts, candied citrus and cherries, with touches of nutmeg, clove and cinnamon. It’s a sweet, satin-textured drink that goes well with the setting sun. Score: 92+ For a ruby Port that overdelivers, consider Taylor Fladgate 2015 Late Bottled Vintage Port (LCBO 46946, $19.00/750mL). Ruby Port is made from a blend of black grape varieties aged for two to six years in wood, thus retaining its deep colour. Taylor Fladgate’s version here shines dark red and unfolds with intriguing layers of fruit that taste sweet and poised yet dark. Blackberry and black licorice mingle with black cherry and cola, burnt almond and coffee, and a whisper of black peppercorn and smoke. And it’s of course long. Score: 93 If you’re inspired to whip up a batch of salted almonds to go with any of these wines, here’s my favourite way to make them. Pour three cups of raw, unsalted almonds into a bowl. Dissolve one heaping teaspoon of salt in about two tablespoons of hot water. Pour the salty water over the almonds and toss. Spread the nuts on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a 400° F oven for about 10 minutes until golden, stirring halfway through. Remove the tray from the oven, pour the almonds into a bowl, drizzle them with about a tablespoon of really good olive oil and stir to coat. The nuts will quickly absorb the oil. You can serve the almonds warm or let them cool and store them in an airtight container. And if you’ve got a bottle of fine table wine kicking around that you want to chill fast, don’t be tempted to throw ice in the glass. Instead, make an ice bath — about half ice, half water — and submerge the bottle. Doing so will chill it faster than ice on its own and you’ll be enjoying your wine nicely chilled (but not too cold or diluted) in no time."

It’s all about the atmosphere, Toronto owners say","[""Chris O'Leary Special to the Star ""]","Tue., July 7, 2020","On a quiet weekday afternoon, Will Johnston was prepping the small but colourful patio seating at the front of Duke’s Refresher + Bar on Front Street East, near the St. Lawrence Market.  For the first time in three-plus months, Johnston, the general manager of the bar, had seats available to customers. It’s just 10 seats for now, with dividers available to shield you from the person next to you. It’s a far cry from the business his bar was doing in early March, when he could expect 400 to 500 customers on a busy night and was anticipating a packed house for St. Patrick’s Day.  “We were fired up,” Johnston recalled. “We loaded up the beer, loaded up the food, got the staff all ready to go. We weren’t taking reservations or anything, but we knew people would fill up the place. Then sure enough, that afternoon (March 16), they said, ‘Hey, all restaurants are closed in Toronto.’” The 10 chairs out front are a baby step for his business, but Johnston is trying to make the most of it. Toronto moved into Phase 2 of its reopening on June 24, allowing restaurants with patios to serve customers. Duke’s got its patio up and running on June 25 and saw a 20 per cent sales increase compared to takeout sales that day a week earlier.  The takeout-to-patio-service dance is one that many restaurants in the city are navigating. But sports bars are in the difficult spot of trying to change their dance steps on the fly. Even if the NBA, NHL, MLB and MLS get off the ground in the coming weeks, there are no guarantees that COVID-19 won’t interrupt or completely derail their seasons.  The biggest issue for sports bars in Toronto will be that they need to not just be functional in Phase 2, but need to have the city advance to at least Phase 3 of reopening, when dining in would presumably become an option.  The pandemic has sports bars across the city and around the world grappling with the same issue: Can sports bars work without sports?  “Part of the draw for sports bars is definitely the sports, there’s no denying that,” said Andrew Kaiser, the co-owner of the Dock Ellis, a sports bar on Dundas West that’s been open almost seven years.  “Given the fact that more than likely it’s going to be at most 50 per cent capacity inside, filling all those seats I don’t think is going to be much of a problem. Definitely, the big sporting events helped us hit 100 per cent capacity. Now the question is, will 50 per cent capacity pay the bills without any kind of support?  “That’s a whole other question.”  Franco Tascione is the chief operating officer for social brands at the Recipe Unlimited Corporation, which owns, among others, Bier Markt. At Bier Markt’s Esplanade location, they have three patios on the property and are capable of seating about 120 people now.  The staff wear masks and every other table is left open to give customers the appropriate space. Inside, where Phase 3 and the big screens await, it’s all about creating the right atmosphere, regardless of what may or may not be available.  “If for any reason sports shouldn’t come back, that doesn’t stop us from (making the restaurant a destination),” Tascione said.  “When guests are sitting in a restaurant, you want to have that atmosphere, that excitement, that energy. Part of that excitement is created by our employees, but imagine walking into the restaurants and you have all these great employees, but none of the TVs are on, no sound is on, no music, no lights, nothing. It just feels very flat.” Tascione points out that there’s a stage at the back of the Bier Markt on the Esplanade. He sees opportunity there, too.  “Streaming live music and streaming things such as events that will create that atmosphere in the restaurant, which I think is important. If for any reason sports shouldn’t come back, that doesn’t stop us from doing all those things,” he said.  Johnston sees challenges ahead for his place and other sports bars. It will be difficult even at 50 per cent capacity when people get together and their inhibitions come down and they start clumping together. He says he and his staff will have to keep people in check. It won’t be fun, but he doesn’t want outbreaks and bar closures like we’re seeing in the United States.  “It’ll be a lot of work to try and keep people away from each other,” he said. “There’s no dancing, there’s no singing on the patio. It’s going to be like a version of ‘Footloose’ in a sense.”  The owners insist there’s still more to a good bar than the games on TV.  “People are social beings. We can’t hide from that or escape that,” Kaiser said.  “A lot of what we do and a lot of what our industry does is make people comfortable, and have people in close quarters and share memorable events, especially in sports bars. People are aching and they’re dying for that level of human contact that I think a good quality sports bar gives. “Before bars we were all sitting around a campfire sharing food and drinks anyway, right?”"
17,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/life/relationships/2020/07/13/a-short-history-of-the-word-simp.html,A short history of the word ‘Simp’,"['Ezra MarcusThe New York Times', 'Jonah Engel Bromwich']","Mon., July 13, 2020","The word “simp” isn’t new. In fact, it’s pretty old. But it has been dragged into fresh popularity. In the same way that older songs can find new audiences on TikTok, older slang emerges on the app to be championed by a broader, younger audience. Too Short, the bawdy West Coast rapper who used the word in lyrics as early as 1985, said that he was not surprised that the word is more popular than ever. “It still means the same thing,” he said. “If I was in a room with a bunch of 20-somethings or even teenagers, I would expect them to know what I’m talking about.” The Evolution of Simp Simp’s new status as a prime insult — a misogynist one, that implies a person is “unmanly” — has lasted most of a year. Mel Magazine, an online journal quick to note cultural trends, deeply dissected the resurgence in October. The “New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English,” defines it as a shortened version of simpleton, so the phrase’s original meaning is rooted in calling someone stupid. The dictionary lists its first known usage as 1946, although it appeared in The New York Times as early as 1923. The most recent entry in the dictionary dates to the 2000 novel “My Once Upon a Time,” by British novelist Diran Adebayo, where “simp” appears twice in the first 20 pages. Adebayo said he had used it to inject an old-fashioned noir tone into the book. “Simp would have been used in an old-school way,” he said. “Not the other way it’s been used as a very soft kind of man, who is very soft to his female friends.” That newer sense of the word — as an insult for being “soft” or “overly sympathetic,” particularly to women — became more prominent in the 1980s and early 1990s. A set of West Coast rappers who regularly addressed pimping, including Hugh-E. M. C., Too Short and E-40, started using it in their songs. “To me it’s like the opposite of the pimp,” Too Short said. “It really degrades the person who you’re aiming it at.” He added that it evoked the sense of something counterfeit: “Like you’re a knockoff pimp.” Too Short said that he may have drawn it from 1970s Blaxploitation movies, where the word thrived. The 1982 B-movie “Penitentiary II” even had a character named Simp. In the early 2010s, the word, still used with some regularity by rappers, was seized upon by members of the nascent “manosphere,” the world of men’s rights activism. Simp became a staple of men’s rights forums, where feminism is derided as weakening men — just waiting for an enterprising TikToker to dust it off and give it a new sheen. Do We Know Where Simp’s Going To? The word’s current definition isn’t too far from Too Short’s. It’s a person, often a man, who throws money or attention at someone else, often a woman, in order to win affection. (It doesn’t work.) That usage only became popular on TikTok in 2019 and may have peaked thanks to a trope made popular by Marco Borghi, whose account, @polo.boyy, has more than 2 million followers. On Dec. 16, he posted a video that showed him posing beneath a block of text. It read: “If she rants to you about her relationship problems and you comfort her,” while Post Malone’s “Rock Star” played. The beat switched. The chords of OutKast’s “Hey Ya” began to play and a text banner flashed: “Welcome To Simp Nation.” Borghi had been making videos riffing on the notion of simps throughout the year. But that one seems to have inspired a boom of simp content on TikTok. The @polo.boyy videos marked the first time that Sterling Fournier, 21, had seen the word on TikTok, where he himself has over 675,000 followers. He made his own video in the same format. He said he had already been aware of what it meant. “If you were out with the boys, you’d say, ‘Oh, I had such a great date with Sydney. I paid for her food,’ and then you know, like, just as a teasing word, we’d be like, ‘Oh dude, you’re such a simp,’” he said. Hope She Sees This, Bro The first wave of simp content on TikTok and YouTube was driven by men. More recently, a simp-related video trope driven by female creators has emerged. Lauren Halbach, 19, posted one such video in May. In it, her boyfriend is resting his head on her torso in bed. A song called “Simp (Simp Nation Theme Song)” starts playing. He jumps up, laughing. “I feel like my boyfriend definitely fits the context of being a simp,” Halbach said. The boyfriend-simp meme gave her the chance to turn the tables on TikTok’s alpha male culture, she said, where women are often “shamed or slammed for being too clingy or being too obsessive over men,” and men mock each other for doing “overly special things for women.” She called the dynamic “very toxic.” The ubiquity of the term “simp” has taken some of that sting out of it. Like other insults, it has been taken up by fan communities, who often refer to themselves as simps for their favorite stars. Gretchen McCulloch, a linguist and the author of “Because Internet,” a book about language online, compared this usage to terms like “stan” or “trash,” as in, “I’m trash for this.” McCulloch called it a self-conscious approach to fandom — “preemptively putting yourself down so that other people can’t,” she said. So ... It’s Sexist? Yes. The word expresses discomfort with equality when it comes to gender and offers a simple way to dismiss the people causing that discomfort. Its resurgence cuts against simplistic ideas about young people, who are often caricatured as beacons of political correctness — woke saviours arriving at a time when America desperately needs them. Fournier said the word’s edginess was part of its appeal. “I think it caught on because it was just, just within that perfect margin where it wasn’t something that you could get like too, too angry about, but it was also something that was still pretty politically incorrect,” he said. McCulloch places simp in the same category of terms as “white knight” and “whipped,” used to degrade men who are “perceived as trying to curry the favour of women.” These also crop up in the world of men’s rights activism where simp is frequently used. Adebayo teaches creative writing at Kingston University London. He said that when he saw the word in his students’ work, it reflected a character’s “backlash or irritation, or even confusion, around quite what you’re supposed to be as a man in terms of furthering your appeal to women.” “A simp is someone that puts like, woman on a pedestal,” said Tiago Garcia-Arenas, 22, a TikTok creator with more than 2 million followers who released a song called “Simp” this year. Such men, he said, see women “as a higher being, or something like that.” And Nelson Cam, 19, a TikTok user with over 150,000 followers, said that the word has also retained its economic associations. Simps, he said, are “guys that spend a lot of money on girls and get nothing in return.” “I feel like a lot of guys saw this word as an opportunity to, whenever they’re in an argument online with I guess, a male feminist or any male that’s sticking up for woman’s rights, they have an automatic weapon that they can just use,” he said. The Enduring Power of Simp Simp has linguistic qualities shared by a lot of timeless slang. It’s short, punchy and easy to pronounce. “You look at the list of words for cool — you know, ‘rad’ or ‘hot’ or ‘bad,’” McCulloch said, “a lot of them are monosyllables that have like a consonant and a vowel and a consonant.” Adebayo agreed that it benefits from sound alone. “It’s a word that sounds quite dismissive and authoritative in its way,” he said. “You can see it being kind of a useful, insulting term.” And longtime users of the word expect it to retain that meaning. “I don’t know what simp will evolve into but it will always be a negative word if you’re called that,” Too Short said."

With a quarter century of multimedia storytelling, Millgate traverses the country in search of dynamic topics, researching issues thoroughly then translating core elements via video, photo and words with credibility. Her latest project is an immersive experience which will keep her on the roads, and streams, of the Pacific Northwest all summer long. “Ocean to Idaho” debuts on social media platforms this summer. The multimedia experience offers audiences the opportunity to track the journey of migrating salmon from — as the title implies — the Pacific Ocean to the Salmon River in central Idaho, an 1,368-kilometre journey. “We have so many things going on, and so many layers of priorities, whether it be figuring out how to feed our family tonight to how we’re going to try to plan a summer vacation,” Millgate said. “And within all of that is wildlife in wild land just trying to do their thing with all of us on top of them. And, just for a minute, I can help people engage in what is going on within our natural resources, despite all the things that we’re doing on top of them.” Her outdoor adventure began at the mouth of the Columbia River in Oregon and will end at the Yankee Fork of the Salmon River in Idaho. Footage gathered during the trip will turn into a finished film plus stories for print and video media outlets countrywide in 2021. “I go stretches at a time, like 10- to 12-day trips at a time, and then I get ahead of the fish so then I can come home, hug my kids, take a shower, catch up, make sure that everything social media-wise is running because that can turn into its own separate beast.” The immersive social media campaign has been a challenge for the veteran journalist. “By having social media, we can reach these audiences in a more dynamic way that really makes them feel involved. My credibility, my accuracy, my journalistic integrity — all those things still exist, but there’s this more accessible layer there where people can engage more.” During her time at home, she writes, edits, cuts video, schedules more interviews — it’s a hectic pace. “As a reporter, it changes the expectation because they want more of the personal behind-the-scenes stuff. I get asked for more of that in the last five to 10 years than ever before. But, we’re still just real people. And so, I go on these assignments and I’m not trying to tell you how to think on an issue, I just want you to think.” Millgate hasn’t run into too many surprises on her trip yet — at least with the fish. “What is surprising me is that everything is falling into place,” she said. “I’m pulling off the impossible here, and I haven’t gotten lost. I find every spot I need to be. I find it when I need to be there. Everyone that agrees to be interviewed is in their spot when I get there. And that’s pretty unbelievable. “It’s almost serendipitous, you know? It’s like, everything that could go wrong is not going wrong.” Millgate is well familiar with the Idaho section of her journey this summer. The rest has been an exciting discovery for her. “You get me past like the very end of this migration route and I don’t know what anything looks like, I don’t know where anything is,” she said. “And so it’s this whole new world of shooting a landscape I’ve never seen and I love that. “There’s nothing boring about it when your eyes are overwhelmed with everything that’s new. I like those days. So the fact that there’s like this rain forest which is the Lower Columbia sitting in the middle of this basic desert migration route, it’s awesome.” Millgate shot a film a few years ago on the Yankee Fork of the Salmon River in central Idaho that was dredged for gold and left in ruins. There she found the genesis for her current project. “When I was in there shooting — I’d never seen a salmon. I’ve never caught a salmon in Idaho. I’ve never touched one. But I saw them in there and I thought, I’m watching them, you know basically on their last day of life and they’re guarding their spawning bed. And thinking, ‘How on earth does this fish do that and what on earth does that journey look like?’ I’m looking at a fish that just swam 850 miles to lay eggs and die. So my imagination kind of wandered: ‘What does that journey look like and how do I chart this back to the ocean?’” Then last year, Millgate severely broke her leg when she was hit by a puck coaching her kids’ hockey team. She was incapacitated for four months. “When that happens to you, and you get thrown down on the couch like that, you really have no other choice but to look at yourself and your work, and where you’re at and what really matters. And I had a lot of those things already lined up in my life. But that concept of following the fish just kind of started sticking with me.” In October of last year, she planned out how she’d pull the project off, with intricate levels of detail, lining up travel schedules and lodging and crews. But then, the pandemic hit, throwing much of the plan out the window. “When that happened, as a freelancer a lot of my work fell away instantly. And there was nothing I was going to do about that. But this project kind of hung on and it morphed into this whole other thing — ‘OK, now we’re going to stack even more odds against you. See if you can pull this off.’ And so, I dumped my flights, I dumped my hotels, I dumped crew, and figured out how to do it in a way that was safe, responsible and reasonable.” Toyota and Four Wheel Campers came through as sponsors for the project, giving Millgate self-contained transportation and lodging in one. “There was all this time between October and May where it was a total wild roller-coaster ride of, ‘OK, this is going to happen. Oh, this is totally off the table,’ to, ‘Hey this is going to happen and it’s gonna look totally different. We’re going to pull it off.’” The practicality of driving through the Pacific Northwest during a pandemic has been a challenge logistically and emotionally for Millgate. “It’s kind of interesting to travel right now, because you get a different sense of how each area is handling it,” she said. “And I’m not with people. But you can feel it. Parts of Oregon are so shut down right now that even passing through without any interaction in a certain county feels uncomfortable.” Millgate doesn’t want to give the impression she’s flaunting any of the pandemic precautions. “I’m not trying to rebel in any way, I’m just trying to bring something that’s important, and bring it in a way that’s responsible,” she said. “And frankly, sometimes it’s quite lonely. You’ve got your interviews, but then you don’t have anyone to hang out with when you go back to your camper. You work 15-hour days because that’s how many hours of light we have right now. And then you go back to your camper. And you’re camping in places where nobody is, that you’ve arranged with someone to let you have a safe place to park in their back lot, or whatever.”"

And when you add the young men who would be their escorts and backup escorts, that number more than doubles. All the work was intended to lead to The Links Inc. Chicago chapter’s 60th annual Debutante Cotillion, a formal ball where the debutantes are presented to society with the support of their escorts, family and friends. But just like proms, graduations and other milestones for young people, COVID-19 squashed this event. “The original cotillion date was April 25, but then we changed it to June 13, and then we changed it to the first weekend in August, and then we said this isn’t going to be accomplishable,” said 2020 Cotillion chair and The Links member Dr. Joy West. Originally scheduled to be held at the Fairmont Chicago under the theme of “Diamonds and Pearls,” the cotillion is now planned for May 1, 2021. “This was devastating for us, basically because of the families. The senior families in particular.” According to West, when the idea for a virtual cotillion was presented, families turned it down. “Families wanted the full experience, and they didn’t think the virtual experience could capture the beauty and grace of the moment for their debutantes, so they opted to wait,” West said. The move didn’t sit well with Havilland Williams, a rising senior at the Chicago High School for the Arts. When she mentioned to friends that she was preparing for the cotillion, she said, many of her peers weren’t familiar with the concept of the ball. She likens it to a quinceanera, but it’s not a birthday party. Cotillion is a rite of passage for young women in the Black community. It’s a tradition that has been going on for 60 years in Chicago under the guidance of the Chicago chapter of The Links Inc., the national women’s service organization based on friendship and community service. Founded in 1950, the Chicago chapter places a special emphasis on volunteering in the fields of youth services, international trends, health services and promoting African American art. “To find out school was cancelled and the cotillion was cancelled? I was really upset,” Williams said. “But what can you do?” Her escort, Lorenz King, who will be attending Morehouse College in the fall, calls the recent spate of cancellations and postponements unfair. As a St. Rita of Cascia High School senior, he trained for the ball alongside Williams but won’t be coming back to escort her. Instead his younger brother will go. “We’ll never get this again in our lives. I’ll never get to graduate high school, I’ll never get prom, and we work so hard. It’s just the feeling of accomplishment, after everything you’ve done, and you’re just not going to get it,” King said. “It gets frustrating sometimes. ... It’s kind of sad that we didn’t get a payoff of everything we did.” West said that all of the debutantes have the opportunity to walk in 2021, and while all the juniors will do so, only about four or five seniors will return from college to participate. It’s a huge miss for participants, after the community service, fundraising, classes and workshops. And let’s not forget finding the proper ball gown, which has to be floor-length and white, accompanied by white gloves. Participants raise money by selling ads to small businesses, and the cotillion class chooses a community organization to receive the money raised. The Chicago chapter of The Links focuses on mental health and wellness, West said. “Our national mission is to transform communities through service, and we feel like continuing the legacy of cotillion by providing an opportunity for our young people to witness resilience through times of unrest, is important,” West said. “What we wanted our current families and community to see is a dedication to continuing to transform communities through service. Even though our goal to give $60,000 (U.S.) back to the community for our 60th did not happen, we have recommitted to doing just that for 2021.” According to LaTisha Williams, Havilland’s mother, the cost to the family of making the cotillion happen runs in the thousands of dollars, and that includes selling $150 tickets to relatives and friends for seats at tables during the event. But Williams said it’s worth it for her only daughter to have this opportunity for education, mentorship and camaraderie. Havilland Williams and King said they not only learned etiquette, but have taken part in financial workshops about stocks and bonds as well as ones centred on mental health. Havilland Williams considers cotillion to be on a higher level than prom. “It has more elegance and grace in it and kind of like ballet — makes me feel poised and pretty, and I like how that makes me feel,” she said. “With prom, it’s just everyone is there, everyone wants to look better than you, but in cotillion, it’s more about unity.” “In the end, you just see the dancing, but there’s a lot that goes into it,” King said. “A lot you can take away from it — years down the line, and that’s why I think it’s better than a homecoming or a prom.” Camille Lonzer, a 2019 debutante from South Shore, says the event was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that she’ll remember forever. “It’s just a rush of happiness seeing everyone in their dress. ... I would compare it to a graduation or a prom because you get to show off and show out. It’s definitely exciting,” she said. “I wasn’t too much of a social person beforehand, and it sort of opened my eyes to a lot of different people who have a lot of different opinions and perspectives. But also the community service aspect of the cotillion, it was life changing for me. I think that’s a nice aspect of it because you really feel like the community needs you as a person.” “2021 will still be our 60th anniversary, although I don’t know what the flavour of that will look like,” West said. “But what we do know is that the journey to cotillion — the rehearsals and workshops — will be a fun and informative time for the debutantes and escorts. We want to make this next year just as interesting as this past year was.”"

If you’d asked for a fizz, say, 100 years ago, the bartender would have handed you a gin cocktail, since the Gin Fizz was one of the most popular drinks of the day. What made it so popular? Aside from being delicious and refreshing, having a carbonated cocktail was still a bit of a novelty. Carbonated water was invented in the 1700s, but it wasn’t until the soda siphon (a.k.a. a seltzer bottle, that made water fizzy with carbon dioxide cartridges) became widely available and affordable that bubbly cocktails became common. For home bartenders, that was in the 1920s. Fancy bars had carbonated water for making sparkling cocktails earlier. One of the most famous and flashy fizzy cocktails was the Ramos Gin Fizz, which was invented in New Orleans in 1888 at the Imperial Cabinet Saloon and, within 20 years of its creation, had become a veritable cottage industry. Some of its appeal was the spectacle of teams of bartenders shaking fizzes for exceptionally long times, which was part of the secret to getting a frothy top. The other part of the trick was adding an egg white, which, when added to a drink and shaken, turns foamy, pretty much the same way an egg white turns into meringue when whisked. The final touch comes from adding soda water at the end, which, just like a soda fountain drink, makes the bubbles rise even higher. Because it contains cream, the Ramos Gin Fizz, is really an indulgent boozy soda fountain drink. It’s delicious, but it’s next-level cocktail-shaking and I prefer to steer clear of dairy in the hot summer months, so I thought it best to use a different Fizz for this column. There are plenty of options, since the family includes at least a dozen different recipes. Some people even include the Mojito and Tom Collins in the family. I have a soft spot for the Silver Gin Fizz—gin, lemon, egg white, sugar and soda water. For this 100-mile version of the recipe, we’ve tweaked this classic slightly by using lime instead of lemon and Beattie’s Farm Crafted Potato Gin ($39.95; LCBO 645622), which is distilled from potatoes in Alliston, Ontario. It’s a neat distillery, since they use the odd-sized potatoes (chip industry rejects) to make vodka and gin, so it’s part of the zero-waste movement, too.  Alliston Fizz 2 oz Beattie’s Gin 1 oz lime juice 1 egg white 2 teaspoons special fine granulated sugar 1 tiny pinch of salt 2 oz soda water Add ice, gin, juice, salt, sugar and egg white to a cocktail shaker and shake rigorously for 60 seconds—until the shaker is ice-cold. Strain into a tall glass with four or five ice cubes. Slowly pour soda water to make it froth up. PRO TIP: Many bartenders keep a small bottle of saline solution at their stations and add a couple of drops to a range of cocktails, including the Fizz. It’s used for the same reason it is in baking, namely, that it helps bring out flavour. A lot of cocktail technique is actually pretty similar to baking, such as the use of egg whites or specific grades of sugar. Cocktail recipes may seem finnicky but, details are important. Special fine granulated sugar, for example, is much easier to dissolve in the cold shaking process than the normal granulated sugar you stir into your coffee. "

It’s worth noting that they weren’t in the pink for long. It was only last summer, really, when we saw everyone, from behemoths like Beefeater to local craft producers like Willibald Farm Distillery, launch a pink gin. This year, judging from the new gins at the LCBO, well, orange is the new pink. Life moves at you pretty fast in the liquor world. From my point of view, this is a good turn of events. The pink-gin craze was largely inspired by the phenomenal success of Empress 1908, a blue gin from Victoria, B.C., that turns pink when you add tonic or citrus. This colour-changing trick is the result of butterfly pea flower but, other than that additive, it was still a proper gin. Many of the pink gins that followed in its footsteps, however, also had a lot of added flavour and sugar. Some had as much as 70 grams of sugar per litre, which verges on being a gin liqueur, as opposed to a spirit. Unlike the pinks, most of the orange gins have little to no added sugar. And, having tasted all the ones I can find at the LCBO, I can say that they’re all also pretty delicious. Not all are orange (sometimes it’s just the bottle), and that’s just fine with me. What follows is a little roundup, from blood orange to Valencia oranges, with a little explainer on how to best enjoy them, since there’s a surprisingly wide range of flavour profiles involved. Most people know blood oranges for their colour first and flavour second, but with the hue-free and aromatic Whitley Neill Blood Orange Gin ($44.95; LCBO 14754), it’s all about the taste. It’s got a bold, candied-orange peel flavour, but with none of the candy sweetness, making it pretty easy to pair with ginger ale or tonic. Our favourite way, by far, to drink this is to turn it into a Blood Orange Negroni — equal parts Campari, sweet vermouth and this gin, stirred and strained into a glass filled with ice. No garnish required.  Since Tanqueray Flor de Sevilla ($30.95; LCBO 573956) is the sweetest of the six at the LCBO, the best way to serve this is to keep it simple — on the rocks with a spritz of soda. One of the nicest things about this light-coloured gin is that you can still taste the juniper through the delicate Seville-orange flavour, so you don’t want to drown it with mix. Two parts gin, one part soda and a wedge of lemon is all it needs. If it weren’t for the fact that this is a full-strength spirit, Beefeater Blood Orange ($30.45; LCBO 15765) could pass for a punchy Italian aperitivo such as Aperol. It’s brightly coloured and has flavour to spare, so it will hold its own in a champagne cocktail like a modified French 75 — one ounce this gin and four ounces cava or other sparkly wine. Of course, gin and bubbly wine is a powerfully dangerous combo, so, if you want to tone it down a little, it’s also delicious with Lemon Tonic — one part spirit, three parts tonic. Made with Sicilian oranges, Malfy Gin con Arancia ($39.70; LCBO 10715) is dry and lively with a complex blend of bitter and spicy notes — frankly delicious. You could stir this over ice and turn it into a lovely Martini with a twist of lemon to fully appreciate its sophisticated flavour profile, or pair it with a straightforward tonic water, such as Fever-Tree Mediterranean. They call the region south of Barcelona the “orange blossom coast” for its ample sweet-orange groves, which provide the inspiration for Botica Valencian Orange Gin ($42.45; LCBO 12668), an international collaboration between folks in Spain and the Netherlands. It’s gin first, orange second, which is also just fine with us — especially mixed with grapefruit and soda water (two parts gin, two parts fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, one part soda).  You can’t really call Hendrick’s Midsummer Solstice ($59.70; LCBO 12564) an “orange gin” per se, since this colour-free botanical-forward gin also showcases fresh berry and floral flavours, but there’s a distinct orange-peel finish that we think qualifies it for inclusion. Like all Hendrick’s products, this is a crowd-pleaser, that becomes even more of an easy-drinking refresher when you add a little Elderflower Tonic. Also makes a great Martini."

Especially lately, since the drink has gone from a dusty old curiosity to a “call drink” — cocktails that aren’t necessarily on the menu, but get ordered by customers anyway. A couple of years ago, bartenders reported that the Old Fashioned was overtaking the vodka soda as the top call drink on King West.  So, if the Old Fashioned is so great, why did it need to stage a comeback? Well, for decades, the original cocktail lost its way as the Fruit Old Fashioned gained popularity. An Old Fashioned is basically just sweetened, slightly bittered, diluted whisky served over ice and garnished with an orange peel, but at some point people decided to take it up a notch by muddling fruit into the drink. That, in itself, wasn’t such a terrible idea. Unfortunately, one of the “fruits” involved was the maraschino cherry. I once saw a bartender take a scoop of bright red Day-Glo cherries and toss them in the bottom of a glass, along with a few slices of orange, smash them up, then add ice, simple syrup and whisky. It was … not good. Fortunately, as more and more bartenders started researching bygone recipes, a more minimalist Old Fashioned was revived. It became especially popular once people realized that it was more than a recipe, but rather a method that could be applied to just about any spirit. Once you master the basics, you can make it with rum, brandy, tequila or even gin. Here, though, we are making it with Canadian whisky, since that’s a delicious spirit — and barrels of it are being made within 100 miles, right here in southern Ontario. Old Fashioned 2 oz Canadian whisky 1 sugar cube 5 dashes Angostura bitters 1 oz soda water Orange peel (1 inch by 2 inches) Method: Place the sugar cube in an Old Fashioned lowball glass. Douse the sugar in bitters, add soda and start muddling until the sugar is dissolved. Add whisky and a couple of large ice cubes and stir for 30 seconds. Express the oils from the orange peel and serve. Or drink.  Tip: Bartenders pay a lot of attention to ice for a simple reason — rate of dilution. Spirit-forward drinks are generally served on one or two large cubes that don’t melt as quickly, since oversized ice keeps the drink from becoming watered down. Jumbo ice-cube trays can be bought at cocktail supply shops like Toronto’s Cocktail Emporium. "

Here, its founder, Chantal Carter, speaks about getting her business off the ground, the hardships she faced along the way and how to maintain the current momentum to support Black-owned businesses.  How did you get the idea to start Love & Nudes?  “I became an entrepreneur because I worked as a wardrobe stylist. ‘Nude’ [underwear] was always something a model needed, and I wanted to enjoy, too, but the big problem was that ‘nude’ was always defined as beige, like a pink tone, and it was only for white skin. So, when the Black models or women of colour would come in for a photo shoot, they wouldn’t have nude undergarments; you kind of had to make do, maybe with black or be naked, but the white models had that. I always thought it was an issue. If you had something that matched your skin colour that would mean that you could wear white or something sheer without your undergarments showing through. My pet peeve was when I wanted to wear lace and I wanted it to look like it was my skin underneath the lace, I couldn’t achieve that. If I wanted a nude bra I had to paint one. I bought a white bra and a white panty and I hand-painted it my skin tone and I didn’t care that it was crusty, hard and uncomfortable. I just wanted the look and I said, ‘We’ve got to do better than this. This can’t be it.’ So, that’s how the idea turned in my head.” What did people tell you when you first came up with this idea and said I’m going to make bras that match every skin tone? “I did research with women on the street, in the mall and I questioned them on what ‘nude’ meant to them, and a lot of the women of colour that I spoke to said, ‘Nude is our own skin tone colour,’ but I found a lot of them identified nude as peachy, beige, rose, even if they were Black or another woman of colour, and I was like, ‘Wow, it’s so enforced, it’s so systemic.’ It never occurred to them that it could be outside of that and that it could be their skin tone, too. Nude has been defined as beige in fashion, in all products, for years. When I was pitching to an investor, I wanted to come out with four different skin tone colours that represented all the skin tones of the world, and he told me that it would be too many colours, for a retailer to carry. I remember how shocked I was. In that moment I was told that I didn’t matter. I wasn’t valid. I was like ‘Why? There’s purple bras, there’s red bras, why is having different skin tone colours an issue?’ I shook it off and kept going, but you keep those little digs. Somebody said there’s an emotional tax when you don’t see things that look like you or you are not validated or acknowledged in everyday life. There’s an emotional tax for that that you have to navigate through, and I really feel it’s important to make that change.” It’s the same in the beauty industry “Same thing with makeup, yes. The Black models and Indian models would come with their own foundation because they couldn’t trust that the makeup artist would have a colour that matched their skin, so yeah, it’s heavy.” So, you empower women when you give them products that are meant for them “That’s what it is. I’m not just a lingerie company or a bra and panty company. It’s about the intimates as a vessel for self-love, acknowledgment and feeling inspired and empowered. You can get up and put on the foundation of your wardrobe every day and it looks like you. You don’t have to think about what to wear, you just put on a bra and panty that matches you and you can go about your day to deal with the everyday difficulties. That helps so much. It’s a good start.” In the U.S. last year the State of New York passed a law where you can’t discriminate based on hair features that would basically apply to Black women. What’s your take on that? “Oh yeah, we feel like it has to be straightened for it to be acceptable and it’s not true. This is where systemic racism, again, comes in. It’s the people who have the positions who don’t look like us dictating what we should look like, and we internalize that. I remember when I stopped straightening my hair and I let it grow naturally, I was going for a job interview years ago and my husband said, ‘Are you going to go like that?’ I was like, ‘This is who I am. I’m not going to put on a wig.’ I was just done with trying to sneak in the back door to be accepted to get the job. If they don’t like me because of my hair, then I don’t belong there. That must change. When there are diverse workforces there are different perspectives, different voices behind the scenes. Then those kinds of rules and regulations are not going to be put out because there’s going to be other voices there that can fight that or say, ‘That’s not accurate, that’s not right.’” What would be your advice for young women who have a business idea? “Well, this was in my head for years before I actually did anything about it. I think what delayed me from getting started is I never said anything to anybody. So my advice would be to speak to the right people, somebody that you trust, because I was in this fear-scarcity mentality that somebody was going to steal my idea, or they’re going to think it’s stupid, or I’m going to be judged, and I think that delayed me from doing anything. Then I reached out to another woman founder who had an underwear line at the time for advice and that was really helpful for me. When you speak to somebody you get another idea or it can lead you somewhere else, or you find new information that you never thought of, so it’s really important to share your ideas, but to the right people.” Love & Nudes is an all-women team with an ethical supply chain. How does that work? “I was so fortunate to find a women-led facility in South America, and we have the same philosophy about supporting our communities. Our bra and panty makers are single mothers being paid fair wages. That was really important for me. I felt like how can I talk about inspiring and empowering other women while not paying people? I didn’t want to go to another country where there was child labour involved or people were being abused because I know what that feels like, as a black woman and as a woman of colour. So yes, my products will cost a little bit more, but it’s because it’s helping to support a community as well. I find when we put women first, the world is a much better place and there’s a chance for things to actually change and improve, so that’s my contribution.” There has been an outpouring of support for black-owned businesses in Canada now. What does this mean to you and how do you hope it translates into long-term values for Love & Nudes? “Well, the last month or so has been really great for brand awareness and to help increase sales for my business. I did a story with CBC and I said, ‘We’re not a trend. This is our lives; this is our livelihood that we want to build.’ I’m really hoping that the support continues, and if people want to end systemic racism, it’s really important for all of us — Black people, white people — to support black businesses to close the economic gap between Blacks and whites and other cultures. We need to continue having these conversations to ensure that it does, no matter how awkward it is. I always say, ‘Without awkwardness or discomfort, there’s no growth.’ If you want to be comfortable all day long, nothing is going to happen. I hope the support continues, and I can get the capital I need to help grow my business along with other Black businesses. We are pop culture. Everything is influenced by us, yet we’re not behind the scenes in fashion and a lot of other industries. Clearly, we have amazing ideas, we have amazing influence, we have a lot of swagger.” [laughs] We’ve had to make something out of nothing forever, so you can imagine what we can do when we do get the support that we need, so we too can grow into billion-dollar companies and give back to the community. Everything starts with families and communities. You need to be economically stable to be able to build families and strong communities. We’re more beautiful all together, not separate.”"

After three days seated at my dining room table, watching what was effectively Quibi for fashion — which is to say, the first streamed digital couture “shows,” forced online by the coronavirus pandemic and transformed into bite-size nuggets that ranged from ersatz music videos to schmaltzy short films and previews for collections to come — I’m starting to wonder. Yes, everyone gets to watch what was formerly an entirely exclusive, just-for-insiders, demonstration of fabulousness. That’s a good thing. But honestly, give me the runway. I never thought I would write those words. Like many, I have complained about the waste involved in fashion weeks: all those people flying around the world to sit twiddling their thumbs waiting for a show to start while ogling the celebrities across the catwalk, most of whom are dressed in full-blown evening clothes at 10 a.m., surrounded by elaborate sets made to be demolished after 20 minutes, all in the service of (in the case of the July shows) a parade of insanely expensive handmade clothes for the very few. Nero, meet your fiddle and all that. But what this whole digital experiment ultimately revealed is that, though music and movies have been using fashion to their own ends for decades now, reversing the equation doesn’t really work. Not even when you rope in a famous film director, as Dior did with Matteo Garrone, the Italian auteur behind “Pinocchio” and “Dogman.” And give him carte blanche to make … a mash-up of myths involving mermaids, Narcissus, satyrs, bellboys and nymphs who really, really, want to wear lamé goddess gowns and wafting, feathered coats instead of barely there bits of chiffon. Not even when you team up with a cult-y musician, like Olivier Theyskens did with Sylvie Kreusch of Warhaus, for his debut at Azzaro couture, all rhinestone siren slinkiness balanced on a knife-edge just this side of kitsch. Not even when you get a famous actress, as Iris van Herpen did with Carice van Houten, formerly the Red Priestess on “Game of Thrones,” and have her animate a single look that plays with your sense of perception in odd angles and cuts, so it seems to grow around her body like a nimbus of rebirth. Not even when you dress up well-known models and convince them to do awkward dancing, as if they were punk princesses at the famous Parisian disco Le Palace, while wearing bejeweled bouclé and lavishly flounced taffeta, as Chanel did. It feels inauthentic: a copy of an idea from another creative discipline. And the problems of couture are not so much financial (most of the brands that can afford couture have enough of a cash cushion to survive the current situation and someone, somewhere, is still buying it) as existential. With the dire state of the world, what’s the point? There’s an electricity to a live event, with its sense of shared experience and risk, that answers that question and cannot be replicated in the vacuum of the internet. There’s a specificity to a fashion show, a rhythm in the entrances and exits and struts, a duet between body and cloth, that has its own cadence and offers its own implicit thesis about the costumes IRL, which loses its force when it gets moved to an URL. It’s too easy to look away. To roll your eyes. And giggle. Well, now we know. And it’s not actually a judgment on the clothes themselves, anyway. It’s a judgment on the context. When is a show not really a show? In any case, thinking of these digital shows as shows is probably wrong in the first place. They were more like a joint declaration of belief: We’re still here! (That’s why, even though it didn’t have an actual show, Maison Margiela offered up a 48-second lava lamp of a show trailer, starring the vamping model Leon Dame suggesting the form of a longer … something … to be a revealed July 16. Ditto Valentino, which clocked in at just over a minute with its hypnotically morphing single piece of fabric/promo for a July 21 show. They wanted to show their faith in the official couture organization, even though their main events are later.) After all, fashion, like so many industries, is in crisis as a result of the coronavirus pandemic: stores shuttered, fabric mills closed, brands declaring bankruptcy. To dare, in the face of a lockdown that separated designers from their ateliers, to create any form of a collection for public consumption is a kind of triumph: an aria of optimism into the void, a testament to imagination and ingenuity. And in fact, the videos that revealed just that — bringing the viewer inside the creation process — were the ones that hinted at couture’s true magic. Ironically, it’s the documentaries that may actually best convey the “dream” that is couture: the handwork and humanity woven into its seams. So while Dior’s movie was misguided escapism (verging on the objectionable, thanks to an entirely white cast, which is the dream of exactly who these days?), its opening scenes, which took place in the ateliers, were irresistible. They showcased the fact that the collection — the gold Aphrodite dress with its flowing cape, the sunburst-shirred high-collar white shirt and a pale-pink halter-neck ball gown covered in beaded branches — had actually been created in miniature, scaled down to 40 per cent of a traditional toile to create a treasure chest of a collection that will later travel the world for clients to ogle and order (full-size, of course). Designer Maria Grazia Chiuri had been inspired by Le Théâtre de la Mode, a travelling exhibition of 150 dolls created in 1945 by designers of the day such as Lucien Lelong, Schiaparelli and Jeanne Lanvin as a way to revive couture in a post-Second World War world and rescue the fashion industry from economic ruin and emotional despair. You can understand it: what worked once, might well work again. Especially when close-ups of the 2020 versions revealed the careful artistry of the petites mains (little hands) that made them, the camera watching an artisan painstakingly using a tiny needle to create the fringing on the hemline of the moonlit gown. Just as it was charming, if not entirely satisfying, to look over the shoulder of Daniel Roseberry of Schiaparelli as he sat sketching away on his “imaginary collection” in Washington Square Park, near the New York apartment where he was sheltering in place, drawing tape measure straps, power shoulders and zeppelin-size balloon sleeves (for looks that will be made later this year). And to have sneak peeks from Ulyana Sergeenko and Elie Saab at the hands transforming basic materials into extraordinary embroidery for their somewhat overblown creations. Even if all the soft focus nature that followed mostly called to mind a perfume commercial. Up close and at home They all made me long for more such intimate experiences: not just to goggle at the flotillas of tulle and cloqué of Giambattista Valli, with their exclamation points of bows both large and small (look: a swan! and look: a white taffeta bow as big as a torso atop a white chiffon dress as tiny as Joan Smalls’ waist!) but to understand how they are constructed. Though to be fair, at least with his video, you could see the clothes instead of just the mood. To really understand the Chanel collection, for example, which ultimately looked a whole lot better than designer Virginie Viard’s recent stabs at half-hearted casual couture, you had to eschew the live action for the static lookbook: 30 styles versus the short’s five, including some lavishly restrained midnight blue gowns and not-quite-understated armorial tweed jackets. In any case, only Viktor & Rolf managed to capture the absurdity of the whole exercise: us, sitting in our rooms around the world, staring into small screens by ourselves, mesmerized (or not) by well-intentioned efforts to elicit asynchronous rapture. They did it with a five-minute play in three acts titled “change” (small c, all in gold balloons) that spliced the classic department store show with today’s working-from-home ethos, with a stentorian voice-over by the singer Mika and a heavy dose of levity. See, for example, an empire-waist sapphire satin negligee spotted with lace storm clouds to reflect “a feeling of sadness and anger familiar to many these days.” Or the pale pink chemises adorned with “contradictory emoji,” the “frantically entangled” sashes swirling around enormous bathrobe coats, and the enveloping A-line silhouettes to guarantee “you will remain in your own safe zone while venturing out into the world.” There was a lot more like that. “If only we could change ourselves as easily as we do our outfits,” said Mika. That is, of course, the promise of all this; the beauty is that we all keep hoping. It just seems so much more convincing from the ballroom chairs."

28,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/life/homes/2020/07/14/these-six-flowers-are-blooming-right-now-and-they-make-a-lot-of-scents.html,These six flowers are blooming right now. And they make a lot of scents,['Mark & Ben CullenGreen Spaces'],"Tue., July 14, 2020","Winston Churchill, the legendary British prime minister, had a way with words. In a 1959 letter to John Weall, the founder of our former company — Weall and Cullen Nurseries — Churchill wrote: “Gardens, trees, bushes and flowers all have their legends woven with trysting place, love blowers, moon drenched meadows, romantic woods, with birds and bees attendant.” His romantic thoughts were likely inspired by the aroma of a flower. After all, romance easily rises in the evening air thick with old-fashioned night-scented stock, nicotiana and heliotrope. We’re now at mid-summer and the flowers in your garden are competing with each other for the attention of pollinators. That’s the real reason why Mother Nature infused many garden variety flowering plants with a sweet scent.  You may have your own reasons for bringing some scent home. Do lilacs remind you of your grandma’s garden? Is phlox a friend from your childhood?  Now is the perfect time to reach into your memories, and create some new ones, by stirring your sense of smell with aromatic plants and flowers. Here are our favourite perennials that are flowering right now — and each heavy with sweet scent. You’ll find these at many garden retailers this time of year. Phlox (Phlox paniculata). The flowers produced by phlox are outstanding by any standard. Sometimes the blooms are so big, they can be mistaken for hydrangea. Butterflies and hummingbirds love them too. They grow to about 70 centimetres and are hardy to zone 4 (Ottawa/Montreal). Bee balm (Monarda). This magnet for many insect pollinators is growing in popularity. It is a native plant, blooms up to six weeks through to early fall, is hardy to zone 4, and, like other native plants, it is insect and disease resistant. When we see aphids on our monarda, we just blow them off with a stiff stream of water from the end of the hose. Bee balm will spread, since it’s a member of the mint family, but not as aggressively. Daylily (Hemerocallis) Fragrant Returns. There are very few daylilies that are truly fragrant — but this one is. Look for it by name. Grows to 50 cm in full to partial sun. It’s very winter-hardy, good to zone 3 (Winnipeg and Regina) and blooms from early summer to mid-fall. Daylilies are among the easiest perennials to grow and after a few years you can dig them up, divide them and move the divisions around your garden. Delphiniums (Delphinium). All delphiniums are fragrant, beautiful and rebloom when you cut them this time of year. They grow to a height of one-to-two metres, depending on the variety and are a favourite mid-summer wedding flower. They tend to grow well for three or four years then disappear and many gardeners have blamed themselves for the demise of their delphiniums. This is a waste of guilt. We recommend that you plant new ones every three years. Problem solved. Hosta ‘Fragrant Bouquet’ (yellow-green leaves), ‘Aphrodite’ (white flowers), ‘Guacamole’ (light-green foliage, white flowers). Like daylilies, hosta flowers are not generally very fragrant — but these varieties are.  You can cut the flowers to enjoy indoors and all hostas produce flowers that attract hummingbirds. Hardy to zone 3 (Winnipeg/Regina). They do best in part-sun to shade.  Russian Sage (Perovskia atriplicifolia). Every sunny garden, with a few square metres to spare, should have at least one Russian sage plant. Their purple blossoms last up to eight weeks, mature at about a metre high and are hardy to zone 4. They tolerate periods of drought and heat, attract butterflies and hummingbirds and you guessed it, they are fragrant. What is not to like?  If you enjoy flowers’ fragrance, don’t let the scents go to waste: Place the plants near a sitting area where you can enjoy the wonderful smell wafting over you in the calm morning air or when romance stirs in the evening."
