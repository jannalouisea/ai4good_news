How many millions of dollars are being spent on roads for cars? Are we getting value for money?  A massive amount of public space is being given away for these death machines to hurtle about and to be parked when they are not moving. Yet when a fraction of that money is given over to the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, columnists like D’Amato talk as if we have somehow become a Communist dictatorship.  Millions of people have been killed by these machines over the last hundred years and they have had a detrimental effect on urban life. Yet, it seems that the “cyclists’ lobby” is somehow the problem. "

There is still so much that is unknown. Will there be another wave of the coronavirus this fall? If so, how severe will it be? Will the volume of customers at shopping malls, restaurants, hotels and other businesses be anything like what existed before the pandemic? Unfortunately, nothing can be predicted with much accuracy. But one thing that seems likely is there will continue to be a great deal of variation in how the virus affects our communities. Already, we have seen how the outbreak in many smaller communities was quite different from what we saw in Waterloo Region, the Greater Toronto Area and Windsor-Essex. The Ontario government wisely responded with a regional approach to reopening that set different dates for different municipalities. Continuing with a community-specific approach will be key to an effective recovery in the months ahead. Governments must ensure employers have the autonomy and flexibility to respond to the unique and very specific market forces in their communities. The same will be true for post-secondary institutions that prepare people for the labour market. Providing colleges with more autonomy is one of the central themes in a recently released white paper, “The Future of Ontario’s Workers,” by the StrategyCorp Institute of Public Policy and Economy. To help Ontario recover from the pandemic, the paper recommends Ontario equip colleges to respond more quickly to specific shifts within each community. One of the paper’s most important arguments is the recommendation that colleges acquire more autonomy to create a broader range of programs and credentials. Ontario’s economic recovery will require rapid private sector growth supported by a highly qualified workforce. Giving colleges more autonomy to create cutting-edge programs that provide people with the expertise to succeed will be pivotal to Ontario’s success. This would include the government allowing colleges to create career-specific three-year degree programs to replace many of the existing diploma programs. Allowing colleges to award three-year degrees — rather than diplomas — means graduates would finally receive full recognition for their academic achievements. It would make a huge difference in Waterloo Region and much of the province. The degrees in science and technology and other fields would make the programs attractive to more students. That’s because the degree credential would provide graduates with more opportunities for employment and advancement. That means greater numbers of students would enrol in post-secondary programs that are important to local employers. Awarding the degrees to graduates would also mean many companies would be in a stronger position to promote themselves internationally, as degrees are the globally recognized credential for such programs. The StrategyCorp institute’s paper makes other important recommendations to enrich the offerings at colleges. For example, it recommends creating master’s degree programs for university and college graduates in high-demand fields such as robotics, cybersecurity and animation. It also recommends increasing the funding for short-term micro-credential programs to help more unemployed and underemployed workers quickly retrain for new careers and supports the ongoing transition to lifelong learning. The recommendations come as Ontario Colleges and Universities Minister Ross Romano consults on ways to modernize post-secondary education. Colleges are urging the government to create a new provincial strategy for higher education that adopts the recommendations in the white paper. Ontario has the potential to emerge from this pandemic as a global leader in post-secondary education. We should seize the opportunity to strengthen higher education to help drive economic growth and create more opportunities for people to succeed in their careers."

How much longer can the world’s longest undefended border remain largely sealed?  It’s an increasingly urgent question facing Canadian governments. Even with the U.S. border open for commercial business, and exceptions being made to allow families to reunite, our joint border is mostly closed. And the impact is huge. This discussion is relevant this week for a couple of reasons. First, the current emergency border-crossing restriction package is set to expire July 21. Second, the government is facing mounting pressure from commercial interests. The Canadian Travel & Tourism Roundtable, a coalition of 120-odd travel and tourism companies including Canada’s major airlines, last month sent an open letter to the government calling for the loosening of travel restrictions.  A second open letter was sent by Canada’s airlines and many of Canada’s biggest companies including banks and telecoms. On one hand it is hard to blame the tourism sector, which has been among the hardest hit by the pandemic, for putting its economic interests first. But it is also more than a little troubling that airlines were quick to do away with social distancing minimums when we know they are crucial in slowing the spread of COVID-19.  Fortunately, it’s not up to the tourism/travel sector to make public policy. That’s up to the government, and based on what top officials such as Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland are saying, protecting public health is still the top priority. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: “We are going to be very, very careful about when and how we start reopening international borders.” Something most people do not recognize is that cross-border traffic is already increasing thanks to loosening of some restrictions. The volume of traffic crossing land borders has increased from about 115,000 a week from late April to early May to 175,000 a week in late June. Officials say those figures include commercial and non-commercial traffic. The number of non-commercial highway travellers entering Canada has nearly doubled over that period, going from about 3,300 a week to about 6,500. At the same time as Canada is allowing more cross-border traffic, the situation in the U.S. is deteriorating. As recently as the weekend states like Florida were announcing record new infections and deaths. Florida alone reported more than 15,000 new cases. American leadership is polarized, with the Trump administration basically in denial. Some states are rolling back reopening, others seem unwilling to do so despite exploding infection rates. Worst of all, America has no apparent unified strategy to regain control. Even if Trump loses the November election, it’s predicted to take months to change direction and get COVID under control.  Under these circumstances, how on earth could Canada even consider significantly loosening border controls? Doing so would literally put at risk everything this country has done right to flatten the pandemic curve. All the work and sacrifice Canadians have endured would be at risk.  It is said that governing in these times is an ongoing struggle to balance safety with renewed prosperity. Fair enough. But on some fronts there can be no overall compromise. The U.S. is not a safe place to be, and Canada should not face further exposure until things change. That could easily keep the border closed until the end of this year, at least, say infectious disease experts. It’s a sad reality with a great cost to Canadians and our economy. But we have no choice."
3,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/opinion/editorials/2020/07/13/me-to-we-to-them-follow-the-money.html,Me to WE to them: follow the money,['Record EditorialWaterloo Region Record'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","It’s truly mind-boggling that after leading the race to carry Canada through the COVID-19 crisis, Justin Trudeau has fallen on his face just metres from the finish line. But that’s what the bizarre decision by the prime minister and his Liberal government to award a fat, untendered contract to WE Charity has accomplished in the blink of an eye. From pandemic hero to — in the minds of some Canadians at least — a zero: That’s been the latest downward trajectory of Trudeau’s reputation. It seemed strange from the start that the Liberals handed WE Charity the formidable job of administering a pandemic-related program worth $912 million. The federal bureaucracy had already been deemed fit to run the two main COVID-19 economic aid programs — the Canada Emergency Relief Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy — with their combined cost of over $160 billion. Why federal civil servants were considered incapable of handling a fraction of that money to encourage young Canadians to provide volunteer services remains a mystery. Questioned about the WE Charity deal, Trudeau initially insisted no one else in Canada could possibly manage the program. So no one else was asked. WE Charity’s modus operandi fuelled more questions and astonishment. It was to receive at least $19.5 million for administering the volunteer program with $5 million of that going to other organizations. Camps would benefit to the tune of $25,000 for hiring volunteers. School teachers would be eligible for up to $12,000 if they enlisted as many as 75 student volunteers. WE Charity itself was on track to employ 450 of those volunteers — which seemed like having its federally-funded cake and eating it too. Such oddities — along with the criticism that it’s oxymoronic to be paying volunteers in the first place — resulted in the government and WE Charity ending their partnership on July 3 and the job of hiring volunteers being handed to the very public servants who had earlier been denied the job. But the steady drip of new embarrassments and new irregularities continues. Late last week, the public learned that far from being properly distanced from the WE Charity deal as he had previously stated, Trudeau sat at the table when cabinet approved the arrangement. Nor did he recuse himself from the decision even though his strong personal connections to WE Charity — he’s friends with the organization’s head honchos Craig and Marc Kielburger — should have raised alarms about a potential conflict of interest. Finance Minister Bill Morneau made the same serious mistake and failed to recuse himself from cabinet’s decision, despite the fact that his daughter, Grace Acan, works for WE Charity. Myopia must be catching. Like a package of fish left out on summer’s day, the longer this fiasco drags on, the worse it smells. Now it turns out three members of Trudeau’s family have received money from WE Charity for their services.  The prime minister’s mother, Margaret Trudeau, was paid about $250,000 to speak at 28 WE Charity events while brother Alexandre Trudeau got $32,000 for appearing at eight. All this happened when Trudeau was in government. Before he was PM, his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau received $1,400 for headlining a 2012 WE Charity event. The prime minister has already been found to have violated conflict-of-interest laws on two occasions. Why he didn’t learn from that, and as a result is being investigated again by the federal ethics commissioner, is as baffling as everything else in his latest scandal. Is it hubris, sloppiness or blindness that explains the latest stumble? Or something more serious? We wait just as we wonder about WE."

For example, they might have made Ontario Premier Doug Ford stop before trying to install one of his pals as the head of the provincial police. They surely would have kept Prime Minister Justin Trudeau from stumbling stupidly into a conflict of interest over the sole source contract that his government awarded to WE Charity, an organization with which the Trudeau family has been involved for several years. Under the contract, now abruptly terminated, the charity was to receive roughly $14.5 million to administer a program that would distribute $900 million in federal grants to support summer jobs for students during the COVID-19 crisis. There was something “off” about the WE deal from the outset. The government did not need an outside contractor to set up or manage the array of programs it created to pump out billions of assistance dollars during the pandemic – programs like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) and Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). The government proved it is remarkably efficient at giving away money. Why then did it need WE to help it give away money through the Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG)? That question alone should have set alarm bells ringing in the corridors of power. And if – through careless indifference or some inexcusable failure of due diligence – it did not set off alarms, the Trudeau family connection with WE certainly should have. Justin is close to his mother. It is inconceivable that he was unaware that she was collecting speaking fees from WE – $250,000 for 28 speeches between 2016 and 2020 – and unlikely that he did not know his filmmaker brother Alexandre (“Sacha”) was drinking from the same well ($32,000 for four WE speeches).  He should not have touched the WE contract with a barge pole. He should not have brought it before cabinet and, if another minister proposed it, he was ethically obligated to recuse himself from the discussion and vote. Now, the Commons ethics commissioner is investigating the prime minister for breaching the Conflict of Interest Act. It is Trudeau’s third trip down that road, and it will produce his third slap on the wrist (following his Aga Khan vacation and SNC-Lavalin controversy). The WE Charity is the most blatant conflict of the three. There is something missing in the Liberal DNA. They are great at preaching transparency and accountability. They campaign on these twin principles. The prime minister advocates them at every opportunity. Yet the Liberals keep acting as though transparency and accountability are guiding principles for everyone except themselves. The Liberals are missing something else. It is the political equivalent of a drug-sniffing dog in the Prime Minister’s Office – an official or (to be on the safe side) officials whose job it is to sniff every proposal that comes into the office for the telltale odour of conflict of interest or other variety of ethical spoilage. We will call this person(s) the Principal Sniffer. If the Principal Sniffer were on the job, she/he/they would have thrown up a stop sign until Trudeau addressed the two questions at the top of this column.  As it is, he had to read it on the front page of the Globe and Mail, and he has been savaged on the TV news. Worse, he has put his minority government in jeopardy. There is no way any of the opposition parties can afford to be seen condoning Liberal equivocation on ethics."
5,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/opinion/editorials/2020/07/10/post-pandemic-waterloo-region-must-change.html,Post-pandemic Waterloo Region must change,['Record EditorialWaterloo Region Record'],"Fri., July 10, 2020","This week Waterloo Region Chair Karen Redman issued a stark warning of what the future holds for this community unless the federal and Ontario governments deliver quick, emergency aid. Tax hikes, service-fee increases, cuts to essential services — they’re all up for grabs, she said, as not only the regional government but the seven other local municipalities struggle to cope with the financial devastation wreaked by COVID-19. And all the time, they must avoid the deficits forbidden by law.  That explains why local governments from this region, having bled tax and fee revenues, have banded together with municipalities across Canada in calling on the federal government to come through with a $10-billion pandemic bailout for local governments. But while there’s an overwhelming case that they should be tossed this financial lifesaver — there must be strings attached to it. Now is the time to do things differently. Now we should embrace what Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge, the four townships and the region itself have consistently and stubbornly rejected — a radical overhaul of local government. The way to achieve this can be found in a special report that was written last year for Ontario Premier Doug Ford and recommended ways to save money while improving life for millions of Ontarians.  After touring the province for months, former Waterloo Region chair Ken Seiling and former senior Ontario bureaucrat Michael Fenn handed Ford a blueprint for transforming 82 upper- and lower-tier municipal governments — including the ones in this region — in a positive way. By the time Ford got the report, however, his popularity had plunged. Aware that municipal reform would rile many vested interests, Ford beat a hasty retreat. The report in its entirety was kept secret. It was wrong for Ford to deny the public information they’d paid for and was in their interest. Suppressing it further would compound that error. While The Record recently received a $960 bill from the provincial government so it can gain access to just part of the report under Ontario’s Freedom of Information law, Ford should show some courage, stop his stonewalling and release it all. The Record will continue to seek disclosure of this report on behalf of taxpayers in this region and throughout Ontario. Aren’t Canadians constantly being told that life after COVID-19 will never be the same? Whether it’s enhanced child care, improved nursing homes, a universal basic income or a new agenda to stop climate change, we’re hearing the country we rebuild should be better than the one we had. The challenge is finding how to fund this new Canada. The nation is mired in the worst recession in generations while the federal government is on track to run the biggest annual deficit in Canadian history — $343.2 billion. Moving forward, every precious public dollar must be spent as efficiently and effectively as possible. The report Ford is keeping hidden could help accomplish this. Given that Waterloo Region is well enough served by a single police service, why does it need seven fire departments? Why is it in the best interest of local residents — as opposed to local politicians and civil servants — to have four library systems, eight sewer and water departments, four building departments and at least five economic development departments in a single region? Amalgamation — that long-dreaded word in some circles — is not the only choice. But the report Premier Ford is sitting on could surely offer other concrete solutions for the financial and service bind that local governments in this region and across Ontario are caught in. If they want help now from Ottawa and Queen’s Park, these local governments should help themselves by embracing, not fighting, reform. And Ford should insist they do."

Somehow, you’ve got to get back down again in one piece. There’s a lesson here for the federal government. After taking Canada to the historic and, frankly scary, twin peaks of deficit-spending and national debt to get through the COVID-19 pandemic, it has to guide us back to safer, more solid terrain. The greatest failing of the fiscal “snapshot” released by federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau on Wednesday is that it doesn’t do this. It doesn’t map out a plan for what’s going to be a very tricky descent.  To be sure, Morneau’s 168-report does a convincing job of showing us why the 2020-21 federal deficit had to hit the $343.2-billion mark — more than 10 times his original, pre-pandemic forecast.  While Canadians may experience a slight dizziness upon learning the federal debt will top $1 trillion — that’s 49.1 per cent of the country’s annual gross domestic product — for the first time ever this year, they should feel reassured all this unprecedented spending was necessary. To save Canadian lives, but also to preserve the Canadian economy from devastation, federal and provincial governments had to lock down the country, which left millions of people unemployed or coping with reduced hours. In the ensuing recession, the federal government lost $71.1 billion in tax revenues. It also ended up holding a $227.9-billion bill for the direct spending and tax measures necessitated by the lockdown crisis.  In taking such extreme actions, the Liberal government kept businesses alive, preserved jobs and prevented families from losing their homes. Trouble is, no Canadian government can keep spending at this rate indefinitely, and Minister Morneau knows it.  The federal debt load is  manageable, thanks to today’s low interest rates. But we can’t keep piling on more debt indefinitely without risking serious credit downgrades that will leave Canadians paying cripplingly high debt-servicing costs. Clearly, Canada has to get down from the deficit-debt mountain top it’s precariously perched on today. To do this Ottawa needs to wind back some of the pandemic spending while playing an essential role in the economic recovery. It will have to be choosy. It will also have to work closely with the provinces on many initiatives.  To start, and considering how difficult it will be for many parents, especially women, to return to or continue with their jobs, the Liberals need a plan to expand daycare. This should arrive before schools reopen, rather than after. Next, the Liberals need to provide assistance to retrain workers whose jobs have been lost to COVID-19. Federal incentives to encourage entrepreneurs to start new businesses could help fill the economic gaps left by businesses that have closed. When it’s safe, Canada should re-open its doors to the immigrants who can build new lives in this country as they help rebuild its economy. And because the pandemic hammered international trade — Canadian exports experienced an “unparalleled drop” in April — this is the perfect time to break down the interprovincial trade barriers that still hamper the movement of goods and services within this country. Finally, and this could prove unpopular, the federal government will have to seriously consider some kind of tax increase to help pay for the recovery. An increase in the GST — a consumption tax — might be the fairest way to do this. It was good to see the government’s fiscal “snapshot” of where Canada stands today. Next up, it should provide a detailed picture of where we’re headed."
7,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/opinion/editorials/2020/07/09/canadas-leaders-deserve-greater-protection.html,Canada’s leaders deserve greater protection,['Record EditorialWaterloo Region Record'],"Thu., July 9, 2020","It will take a court to decide the fate of Corey Hurren. He faces 22 charges after a truck loaded with guns crashed through the gates of the Ottawa residence of both Canada’s governor general and prime minister. But it will require neither judge nor jury to find the federal government guilty of failing to properly protect two of this country’s most important leaders. While it’s chilling to consider what might have happened, it beggars belief to realize what actually occurred and how massive a threat it posed to human life and national stability. Exactly one week ago — July 2 — an intruder driving a Dodge Ram pickup truck tore through the fence at Rideau Hall at 6:30 a.m., then walked to a nearby greenhouse, allegedly carrying at least one weapon.  For more than 10 minutes, the intruder roamed the grounds, apparently unchallenged. At 6:45 a.m., RCMP officers located him and began talking to him. An hour and 45 minutes later, he was taken into custody. Later Hurren, a 46-year-old Manitoban, was charged with a variety of serious offences that involve weapons and uttering threats. It was fortunate, to say the least, that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his family and Gov.-Gen. Julie Payette were not at their Rideau Hall residences when this egregious security breach happened. The RCMP allege the intruder carried a high capacity magazine and four loaded firearms. In addition, police allege the suspect threatened “to cause death or bodily harm to” Trudeau.  Canadians need to know how all this could have happened. Then they need to see evidence that new and robust security measures will be put in place to ensure nothing like it occurs again. Why was it so easy for a simple pickup truck to make it through the physical barrier surrounding the homes of the governor-general and the prime minister? There’s no reason to suspect this was part of an elaborate conspiracy involving several people. It didn’t take explosives to get through that fence — just one person and a vehicle like the one millions of Canadians drive every day. And why, once the intruder got past that barrier, did it take police so long to find him? It’s virtually certain there’s some kind of closed circuit television and other electronic monitoring at Rideau Hall. Yet whatever protective system the RCMP employs, security expert Wesley Wark, a University of Toronto professor emeritus, observes, “It seems like a slow timeline of response in … this incident.” That’s putting it mildly. This isn’t the first time in recent years a prime minister of Canada has faced a serious threat, either. In October 2014, a gunman was shot dead after murdering a Canadian soldier at the National War Memorial and attacking Parliament Hill’s Centre Block, where then-prime minister Stephen Harper was working. You’d think that after that frighteningly close call, the federal government and the federal police force would have effectively reviewed all the security measures afforded to Canada’s prime minister and governor general. You’d expect any security holes would have been filled. The events of last Thursday strongly suggest you’d be wrong. The country owes far more to its head of government — the prime minister — and its governor general, who serves vital state and ceremonial functions. They should not have to fear for their lives or the lives of loved ones as they fulfil their duties to Canada. But the country owes more to itself, too. In shielding our leaders and their homes, we guard the democratic institutions that are part of the lifeblood of this nation."
8,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/opinion/columnists/2020/07/01/wilmot-council-discussions-about-mayor-and-statue-should-have-been-open-to-the-public.html,Wilmot council discussions about mayor and statue should have been open to the public,['Luisa D’Amato'],"Wed., July 1, 2020","The people of Wilmot Township deserve much better. They were never consulted in the decision, more than four years ago, to bring the statues of Canada’s prime ministers to the grounds of Castle Kilbride, a museum in Baden. And earlier this week, Wilmot residents were excluded again when they were shut out of two township council meetings in which it was discussed what to do with the statues, now that one of them has been repeatedly defaced with red paint. Council met on Monday and Tuesday, but those meetings were closed to the public. And although the township said that no decisions would be made by council at these meetings, that’s not really true.  There was at least one decision, announced right after Tuesday’s meeting. Wilmot Township will have consultations about the defaced statue of Sir John A. Macdonald. This will take place with Indigenous people, other marginalized communities, the public and the people who donated the statue. “Invitations will be extended to stakeholders to address such topics as the impact of the statue, reconciliation, options and desired outcomes,” said a statement from the township. In other words, township council is now open to considering new ideas, such as removing the statue of Sir John A. Macdonald from the collection on the grounds of the township offices, or possibly moving all five statues to an indoor space. Otherwise, it seems to me, councillors wouldn’t be going out of their way to invite the opinions of people who specifically have requested such changes. That’s a change of direction on the part of council that absolutely should have been discussed and decided in public. I asked every elected township councillor to comment on this. The only response I received was from Jenn Pfenning, who told me on Twitter that “we are committed to listening before making decisions.” Coun. Angie Hallman gave notice of motion June 22 to take a pause on adding new statues to the project until after there are community consultations. The vote on this is scheduled for July 13. But councillors have clearly already decided what they’re doing. At this private meeting, they were even discussing who they should connect with for the consultations. And after the private meeting was over, they announced a decision that they haven’t even voted on yet. What kind of democracy is this? Hallman earlier defended the closed meetings as a chance for councillors to “authentically share our feelings” about recent events in the township. “We needed to have these honest discussions about what was on the agenda,” she said. But why can’t the councillors be authentic and honest when the public is watching? Isn’t that what you sign up for, when you run for elected office? Meanwhile, the municipality assured its residents that the Municipal Act allows for meetings to be held without the public being invited. So it does. There is justification for limited exceptions to the rule of open meetings. If you’re deciding whom to hire as your new chief administrative officer, it’s unreasonable to publicly broadcast the pros and cons of each candidate. If you’re getting sensitive legal advice, it makes sense not to tell the world about it. But what Wilmot council did on Monday and Tuesday does not pass the sniff test. “When in doubt, open the meeting,” says a guide for municipalities from the Ontario Ombudsman, which also investigates complaints of meetings that are improperly closed. The Ombudsman also advises that a meeting could be partially closed for some information to be received, but then opened for the rest of the discussion. One of the things the council did in its private meetings was discuss followup from the statement of apology given by Mayor Les Armstrong, who had shared a controversial and deeply upsetting video on Facebook, alleging the Black Lives Matter movement is a hoax. Armstrong has since taken the video down and apologized several times. On June 26, at the last Wilmot council meeting that was open to the public, he was whacked like a pinata as the public and fellow councillors criticized his judgment. Some asked him to resign.  Armstrong said he wouldn’t resign, but would learn to do better. He pledged to arrange and pay for his own training. His council colleagues will receive quarterly reports on his progress. But his fellow councillors weren’t done. In the private council meetings this week, there was a “frank and heartfelt exchange” as councillors described their personal experiences since the original post, and community feedback they have received. The township says these discussions fell under the clause allowing for “personal matters about an identifiable individual” to be discussed privately. It was explained to me later that there were members of the public whose names and experiences were part of the discussion, but which needed to be kept confidential. Councillors, that is not a good reason to close two full meetings. If someone complaining about Armstrong’s behaviour needs to have his or her identity kept secret because of safety or privacy concerns, either close the meeting for a few minutes to talk about that one individual, or don’t use identifying information about that person. Ultimately, let’s not forget that the mayor works for all the people of Wilmot.  If anyone is entitled to a frank and heartfelt discussion of his behaviour, it is the people of Wilmot. They need to make sure he is able to represent them properly. They need to understand the damage in the community that was caused by his actions. Neither of those things can happen when they have the door to the meeting shut in their faces."

Since about 81 per cent of Canadians live in cities/urban areas, we need to talk about this. We are never going back to “normal.” Normal wasn’t working very well anyway. As we carefully reopen our cities, we need to equally address our environment, equality, our community health and our economy.  I don’t know what it looks like now, but my ideal for a city is based on when I lived car-free in a triplex on a tree-lined side-street half a block north of The Lakeshore in southern Etobicoke. The street was a mixture of small apartment buildings, single-family homes, a few triplexes, three churches and a very odd semi-underground building for the Independent Order of Oddfellows. The streetcar stop was at the corner, and I could walk to work or Lake Ontario in about 15 minutes. Every once in a while a parade would inexplicably come down our street. Also within a 15-minute walking radius were an independent grocery store, clothing store, fresh produce store, Polish deli, post office, my bank, drugstore, liquor store, fairly good bar, hardware store, really good Italian restaurant, great greasy spoon for breakfast, and even a second-run movie theatre. A highlight for me was being able to carry our new couch home from the furniture store around the corner. Schools and several large manufacturing companies were nearby; downtown Toronto was just a streetcar ride away. Our cities have to be welcome, resilient, sustainable and livable for everyone. Even though they make up only two per cent of the world’s land mass, cities consume 66 per cent of the world’s energy and produce 70 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the C40 Cities organization. We need national targets to reduce our carbon output, and our cities need to pick up the pace. Change is hard work, and trying to drum up political will is frustrating. Former MP Marlene Jennings once shared a great metaphor. She said that making policy changes at a federal level was like trying to turn around an ocean liner; at a municipal level, it’s more like turning around a canoe. Although our municipal governments are the creatures of our provincial government, they have a huge impact on our daily lives, managing and funding everything from airports to water and sewage. Both The Association of Municipalities of Ontario and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities are great resources to understand their responsibilities. Who pays for all of this? We do. For example, 38 per cent of The Region of Waterloo’s 2020 Budget is from private and business property taxes, 27 per cent from provincial and federal grants, and 16 per cent is from user fees such as parking tickets. Our role, as citizens, is to stay engaged with local politicians, to ensure a carbon-neutral future. And we’ve been talking about the kind of changes we need for a very, very long time. Almost 20 years ago, Gil Penalosa shared his expertise at a Walkable Bikeable Waterloo Forum. As the founder of 8 80 Cities and former parks commissioner for Bogota, Columbia, Penalosa successfully increased parkland and trails and introduced car-free days in that city. Penalosa moved to Toronto with 8 80 Cities and is still working to “enhance mobility and public space so that together we can create more vibrant, healthy, and equitable communities … that we can grow up in and grow old in.” His practical solutions included lowering city speed limits to 30 km/h, allowing only pedestrian and bike traffic on certain streets, scramble intersections so all pedestrians cross at the same time, more tables and umbrellas on the street, dedicated bike lanes, and more. He also said that buildings should never be taller than about eight storeys high — high enough to optimize population density, but not too high that you lose connection to the street. With a growing population, we definitely do NOT want to spread sideways and threaten our protected countryside line. Our living spaces must meet the needs of the young and old and everyone in between. Why not Babayagas for senior women, tiny homes or even year-round trailer parks for starter homes? What about co-housing? We can’t go back to normal. We need a better balance between our environmental, community health, and economic needs. We have to start where we live."

And in the seismic moment after George Floyd’s death in police custody, North American cities have erupted with the kind of mass protests unseen since the civil rights movement of the ’60s. Kitchener, in true Canadian fashion, staged a kinder, gentler rally of its own last week, drawing thousands of masked protesters to march peacefully along city streets, throwing garbage into conveniently located bins on the sidewalk. But what happens when the flames die down, public interest wanes and everyone goes back to their tedious, pandemic-confined lives?  Does racism become a thing of the past? Or does everyone tire of the subject and move on to the next social-media outrage? Waterloo Region is lucky to have a cache of articulate, passionate activists with lived experience willing to speak truth to power. But there’s sadness, frustration — often palpable — and impatience with those who don’t “get” that anti-Black racism isn’t some new issue that just emerged in the last two weeks. In today’s spotlight: Christopher Taylor, the author/Black history prof recently named University of Waterloo’s Anti-Black Racism Adviser; and Ruth Cameron, community leader/doctoral student/executive director of the AIDS Committee of Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo and Area. Their comments below are scathing, blunt and, in some cases, darkly ironic, because after 400 years of struggle, gallows humour may be the only refuge. On a personal level, how are you two holding up? Cameron: I’m a queer Black woman who’s a mother and a leader. I’m seen as a resource, so I have to make sure I focus on radical self-care. We’re trying to live while we’re in active grief. Taylor: I’m getting a lot of messages from concerned white folks. I might just start resorting to cutting and pasting a Black-faced smiling emoji. Searing images of burned out storefronts, militant police lines and tear gassed protesters have plunged U.S. cities into chaos and sparked protests in Canada. Is this a pressure valve being released or just more racial tension you didn’t ask for? Taylor: Black folks are asking for life and basic human rights and the response is to quell it with state controlled violence, which is the language of white supremacy. Cameron: Yo, it’s full on fascism, folks. Stay ready. Also, take a very close look at what’s happening in political spheres close to home. Not just every four years, but All. The. Time. I want to remind people that the Montreal police used tear gas on people (last) week, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Is this a bellwether “MeToo” moment in which the world changes in an instant, or one in a long line of momentary blips that will ultimately achieve nothing? Taylor: From the conversations I’m hearing, and what I’m seeing on social and mainstream media, folks are not about real change. They’re about feeding that guilt hunger through Black pain. So it’s going to be a lot of tears, then by Canada Day weekend — if things “open-up” a bit more — it’s going to be business as usual. White folks at the cottage in their Birkenstocks.  You’ve seen this scenario play out before.  Taylor: People like to go back to the 1960s, but conveniently like to forget Ferguson (where police shot an unarmed Black teenager) six years ago. Or Rodney King or the Yonge St. uprising in 1992. White collective memory when it comes to race and racism is like a goldfish trying to remember where it parked the car. Cameron: Black people are killed every day by systemic anti-Black racism. It’s not rare. It’s a constant backdrop in Black lives.  So why has Floyd’s death sparked such a prolonged and heated response? Taylor: Because we’re in a global pandemic with a U.S. government that would do anything to distract the masses from the fact they have the highest positive case load in the world and by far the most deaths.  So it’s the intersection of Donald Trump, COVID-19, warm weather, 400 years of racism and one Black death too many?  Taylor: Folks are now paying attention because they have nothing else to do. They got tired of baking and Instagram fitness challenges. I get the cynicism, but am I wrong in saying this time feels different? Cameron: What differs now is the tone of our calls to action. The young people I mentor and work with aren’t interested in incremental change. This is no call for reform. We want completely different ways of doing things. If the system you’ve created is hurting me, I’m not going to say “harm me just a little less.” I want it to end. Black people are rising up to claim our humanity. Christopher, you described Floyd’s death as a modern-day lynching. Taylor: What a lot of folks fail to realize is that lynching in the U.S. and Canada was a spectacle. Just like how we would go to the movies, white folks would go and see that n***** swinging off a tree like Strange Fruit. They would even take pieces off the deceased human as a souvenir. So when white folks watch the video of a Black man being killed, they really need to ask why? Might be to feed their curiosity, blood lust, guilt. Whatever it is, it ends up being a form of entertainment. And for you? Taylor: I don’t watch the videos. Seeing this Black man getting killed is a mirror to my own mortality. What about Regis Korchinski-Paquet, the Afro-Indigenous woman who fell 24 storeys to her death in the presence of Toronto police? Cameron: Her body was left out for six hours before her remains were taken away. George Floyd was slowly murdered on camera for nine minutes by a police officer who casually kept his hands in his pockets. The manner in which Black people are killed and our remains displayed is an intentional message that we are disposable.  I’m parroting a refrain from the chattering class: surely morally superior Canada is above all this. Taylor: Canada just loves to point the finger at the U.S. Meanwhile, it allows us to change the channel on the fact our government has failed its own — white — citizens. How can we expect white folks to care about Black people when they don’t even care about their own parents and grandparents dying/murdered in long-term care homes? Where were those protests? How effective has the media been in cutting through the hype? Taylor: White media should be asking white police officers and politicians why they think it’s OK to defend the killing of a Black man. They should be asking white folks about white supremacy and not how they feel about Black people. Cameron: I’m aware how hard individual journalists have to fight with editors to capitalize the ‘B’ in Black, to frame our issues as “systemic” versus individual isolated events, to ask hard questions instead of “Hey Ruth, how is this stuff making you feel?” I’m grateful for that. But mainstream media has a lot of catching up to do, to communicate where Black communities are now. Incremental change is not OK.  White liberals are outraged by Floyd’s death, pledging solidarity and support on social media. Given the lack of historic follow-through, there’s a stench of hypocrisy. Taylor: I’m all for raising awareness. I think that’s a real key in any kind of change movement. But let’s be real for a second: when was the last time a hashtag prevented a murder or an assault? Or impacted the climate we live in? Are sexual assaults at zero on university campuses after the #MeToo movement? Cameron: There is absolutely NO point in making any statements unless they contain a clearly defined commitment to an action. Black cultures are all about accountability. I also hear grumbling from older white men about what they perceive as an angry, resentful tone when marginalized voices take the podium. They want a more “nuanced” conversation.  Taylor: I think they need to go sit in the back of the class, shut up and listen. They take up too much space. Did I provide enough “nuance” or did I just fall in the trap of the indignant and “angry Black man?” Cameron: “Civility” and “nuance” are strategies used by some white people to deflect when Black people express that we’re living in constant harm. Taylor: What these older white men or SWAMs — Straight White Able-Bodied Men — fail to realize is that when they speak up and ask for a “fairer” or more “nuanced” conversation, they actually mean that they want the conversation to fall within parameters they control, that they dictate, that fall under their terms and in language they understand. What can all the self-professed allies who have suddenly popped out of the woodwork do to make a difference? Taylor: There’s no blueprint for white folks to follow. It’s like teaching a lion to be a vegan. If there’s one thing I would suggest, it’s to understand that this s*** happens every day. Black bodies are being killed and there’s no hashtag or protest. Just because it’s not popping up on your social media feed — your echo chamber of a fabricated reality — doesn’t mean it’s not happening all the time. Cameron: Donate to organizations that are Black-led and serve Black people. Hire multiple Black people, rather than individual tokens. Interrupt racism and amplify Black decision-making leadership within your organizations. Stop consolidating power and hoarding resources. Share and hand over. Even in Waterloo Region, a serenely insulated multicultural nirvana? Taylor: We don’t live in a vacuum. We wake up for the “sensational deaths,” but anti-Black racism permeates all facets of society. Black kids being followed in stores; not being called on in class; the liberal use of the ‘N-word’ by white folks; the co-opting of Black voices for political gain. These are all functions of the same system that killed George Floyd. Cameron: Black people in Waterloo Region are subjected to targeted policing surveillance in neighbourhoods like Chandler-Mowat and Kingsdale, the school resource officer program and the Community Outreach Program (COPs). This must end now, and those financial resources must be given to the Black community to administer. These programs are run by “allies,” are they not? Taylor: I’m always wary of institutions that co-opt the language of the oppressed, stand as “allies,” but actually and deliberately choose not to make change. The FBI knew that folks wanted to kill Malcolm X, and when they would do it, but they didn’t stop them. Why not?"

First question: Will Donald Trump — “the world’s most dangerous man,” according to his niece, a clinical psychologist — run for re-election as president of the United States in November? Second question: Can grandfatherly Democrat Joe Biden — as amiable as he is uninspiring — defeat the most unpopular president in decades? The first question may seem silly. Of course, Trump will run again. He is a stable genius. He is infallible. Not even fake news can stop him. He is No. 1 on Facebook. His adoring base will make him president again. He knows these things. The answer to the second question should also be yes, shouldn’t it? Biden may be too old (78 in November), a relic, but that doesn’t matter. The former vice-president is polling eight to 10 points ahead of Trump; he leads in the battleground states of 2016, and, if the numbers hold, he’ll be known as Landslide Joe. Maybe. But let’s wait and see. Let’s start with Trump. There were signs last week of unease in Donald’s World (not to be confused with Disney World, which is the real thing). It wasn’t just the publication of the family tell-all book by niece Mary Trump, which soared to the top of the bestseller lists before it could be shipped to bookstores.  The White House was also shaken by a remarkable article by Carl Bernstein — he of Watergate fame — that was published by CNN online. Applying his formidable investigative skills to dig into Trump’s dealings with foreign leaders, Bernstein reported that the president does not bother to read briefing material or listen to his advisers before telephone calls with other leaders. He regularly panders to Russian President Vladimir Putin, boasts to Saudi royalty about his own wealth, and bullies the leaders of America’s best friends, telling they are weak, stupid, fools and losers. (Yes, Justin Trudeau is among the abused.) The next blow came in a report by Fox News — of all people — that Trump is in a “fragile” mood and may drop out of the election. Republican insiders are disposed to be more candid with friendly Fox than with other news organizations, and the network quoted one of them as saying, “It’s too early, but if the polls continue to worsen, you can see a scenario where he drops out.” The polls are bad and worsening, as Trump’s approval rating is driven down both by his handling of the coronavirus crisis and by his reaction to Black Lives Matter. A Washington Post poll put his approval/disapproval rating at 36/62 while a New York Times poll put it at 38/58.  His electoral support is in decline. It was down to 40 per cent in several polls last week and dipped to 39 per cent in a few of them. In American politics, 40 per cent is considered a warning shot across the bow of an incumbent president while 35 per cent spells disaster.  The last two presidents who sank to 35 were Jimmy Carter in 1980 and the first George Bush in 1992. Carter lost to Ronald Reagan and Bush to Bill Clinton. There were even rumours last week that Vice-President Mike Pence might not run again. All this should be good news for Joe Biden, but the Democrats have reasons to worry. One of them is money. Trump has been building a war chest ever since the 2016 election and, his disapproval rating notwithstanding, he raised a record $131 million in June. According to his re-election campaign manager, Brad Parscale, Trump has 1.3 million volunteers trained and ready to go. Also according to Parscale, Trump will not be running as an incumbent president with a record to defend. He will run as he did four years ago — as an outsider taking on the Washington establishment, as conveniently represented by career politician Biden, an establishment insider for 47 years. Can Trump pull it off again? I wonder."
12,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/opinion/contributors/2020/07/05/in-canada-it-matters-who-has-jurisdiction-and-who-does-not.html,"In Canada, it matters who has jurisdiction and who does not",['John Milloy'],"Sun., July 5, 2020","As Canada emerges from COVID-19, our public policy to-do list is very long: long-term care; precarious workers; systemic racism in policing and other institutions; jobs; and poverty — to name just a few. Justin Trudeau better step up — right? Get with the program, people. Canada is a federation in which responsibilities are divided between different levels of government and responsibility for much of the list presented above lies with the provinces. So why is the knee-jerk reaction of many Canadians, particularly Ontarians, to turn to Ottawa instead of Queen’s Park to solve every problem? There are a few obvious answers. From childhood, we are taught that the prime minister is Canada’s boss and trying to understand the nuances of federalism is about as interesting as watching paint dry.  Then there is the fact that federal politicians often enjoy mucking about in areas of provincial responsibility because they are often more high-profile and politically sexy, like Trudeau’s bizarre recent promise to ensure 10 paid sick days for all workers in Canada. Although it sounds like a good proposal, other than in a few narrow instances, labour standards are a provincial responsibility.  “So what,” you may say. “Other than undermining boring constitutional niceties, why is it a bad thing for Ottawa to browbeat the provinces into submission on important issues like sick leave, more hospitals or improved long-term care? What if Ottawa is prepared to put money on the table?” Let me offer three reasons why we should be wary of Ottawa getting involved in provincial business. First, provincial governments understand their systems, their players and what is or isn’t possible.  Second, provinces know where the need is the greatest — which doesn’t always align with the loudest voice or the highest-profile proposals.  Third is the issue of accountability. The federal government might get involved in an area of provincial jurisdiction, but it is the folks in the provincial legislature who are answerable for it. Federal involvement can put them in an impossible situation. What if the federal government didn’t invest enough to achieve the promised ends? What if the federal initiative demanded matching dollars that the province would have rather invested elsewhere? Provincial governments are not always innocent victims. As a former provincial politician, I remember trying to blame Ottawa for provincial shortcomings in an effort to divert attention and extort needed federal dollars. These games are not necessarily helpful. Although there is plenty of room for federal-provincial co-operation and revenue sharing, there appears to be enough work to go around for each level of government to concentrate on its own set of responsibilities. Of course, there is an elephant in the room. What if you don’t like your provincial government? Like many, I was upset when the Ford government eliminated paid sick leave for many Ontario workers. Although part of me would love to see Ottawa force Ontario’s hand, I also recognize that Doug Ford has a mandate from the people of Ontario and it is up to us to pressure Queen’s Park for change.  Discussions about federalism might seem out of place in a world that appears to have imploded. But think about it: as we make plans to dig ourselves out of this mess, isn’t the logical first step to figure out who is in charge of what?"
13,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/opinion/contributors/2020/06/28/delays-in-meng-extradition-process-put-the-two-michaels-in-increased-peril.html,Delays in Meng extradition process put the two Michaels in increased peril,['Geoffrey StevensContributing Columnist'],"Sun., June 28, 2020","Justice delayed is justice denied, as the old saying goes. But that’s only the half of it in the Meng Wanzhou extradition case.  In the Meng case, fraught as it is with international political implications, justice delayed is downright dangerous. With pressure growing almost daily, the delay endangers the futures, even the lives, of Canadians Michael Kovrig, a diplomat on leave, and businessperson Michael Spavor, who are incarcerated in China.  Official denials notwithstanding, the Meng affair has, from the beginning, been as much political as it has been legal.  The U.S. case against Meng, the chief financial officer (and daughter of the founder) of Huawei Technologies, had its origins in a 2013 transaction between Huawei and the international bank HSBC. In the course of applying for a $1.5 billion (U.S.) loan, Meng, it is alleged, made false statements that understated Huawei’s relationship with Skycom Tech. Co., an Iran-based company controlled by Huawei. As U.S. authorities saw it, Meng’s statements constituted fraud and were intended to evade American sanctions against Iran. On Aug. 22, 2018, a New York court issued a warrant for the arrest of Meng, who had been living in Vancouver. The United States requested her extradition under a Canada-U.S. extradition treaty. On Dec. 1, 2018, Meng was arrested as she passed through the airport in Vancouver. This news became public on Dec. 5. China demanded her release the next day. On Dec. 7, she appeared in court in Vancouver to hear the charges read against her. Three days later, China arrested the two Michaels. On Dec. 11, with Meng freed on $10-million bail, Trump raised the stakes from simply legal to highly political. He told Reuters that he would “certainly intervene” in Meng’s case “if I thought it was necessary” to help forge a trade deal with China. In other words, he was prepared to use her as a bargaining chip. At that point, Ottawa might have used the introduction of this political dimension, plus the fact that Canada was not a party to the Iran sanctions, as reasonable grounds to abandon the extradition effort, a step that might — and I emphasize “might” — have prompted China to release Kovrig and Spavor.  The minister of justice has the authority to intervene at any stage to halt an extradition proceeding, but the government, undoubtedly fearful of antagonizing the mercurial and twitchy Trump, chose not to intervene then or at any subsequent stage as the process dragged on and on — through 2019 and into 2020. Any hope that the B.C. Supreme Court would get the federal government off the Meng hook evaporated last month when Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes ruled that the allegation that Meng had lied to HSBC in 2013 would, if proved, constitute a crime in Canada and was, therefore, enough to allow the extradition to proceed.  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — acting on valid concerns about encouraging hostage-taking — has hardened the government’s position. He rejects all suggestions that the government stop the extradition and, in effect, exchange Meng’s liberty for the release of the two Michaels.  Meng is due back in court on Aug. 17 in proceedings destined to continue into 2021. They may well, some experts say, stretch to 2024 — leaving the fates of the two Canadians hanging in the balance. It seems ridiculous to this layman that extradition proceedings are allowed — even encouraged — to drag on so long. Parliament could amend the 1999 Extradition Act to build in time limits. When an application for extradition is received, is there any reason why the act could not stipulate that the application be heard within, say, one month and that a decision be rendered within one additional month. Could the appeal process, which can extend all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, not be drastically shortened or even eliminated? Changes now would not help with the exceptional Meng case, but they might prevent future extraditions from escalating the way Meng has."
