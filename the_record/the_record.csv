After nearly four months living under strict COVID-19 protocols, Waterloo Region will now begin life under the “new normal” of Stage 3 on Friday.  The third and final phase of Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s COVID-19 economic action plan, branded as the “Recover” stage of the provincial framework, will see the province move toward a reopening of most businesses in the approved regions.  “Nearly all businesses and public spaces will be able to gradually reopen in Stage 3, with public health and workplace safety restrictions in place, while some high-risk venues and activities will remain closed until they can safely resume operations,” the provincial framework reads.  Physical distance requirements of two metres will remain in place, but new protocols allow for groups of 50 to gather inside and groups of 100 to gather outside.  Restaurants, gyms, bars, movie theatres — all will be given the opportunity to follow the new framework to reopen back to the public.  And for businesses that have been bleeding cash for months, the announcement comes just in time.  “We are so excited to finally be able to reopen our doors,” said Brittany McLean, co-owner of the fitness studio F45 Kitchener Sportsworld. “Like anything, there are some worries but we know that happens when moving through uncharted territory. We have some incredible systems in place to be able to provide a safe workout environment for our community, and right now that’s all that matters.” Their studio will utilize individual squares, socially distanced, with no two people sharing the same equipment at any time. Masks will not be required for anyone working out.  Minto Schneider, chief executive officer of Waterloo Regional Tourism Marketing Corporation, will host a panel discussion Thursday on best practices for restaurants in the region.  Nick Benninger of the Fat Sparrow Group, Alex Kastner of Cambridge Mill, Jody Palubiski of the Charcoal Group, as well as representatives from public health and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, will participate.  But as has become customary with government announcements in the time of COVID-19, Palubiski said they are still awaiting specific guidelines on how restaurants can resume service inside.  All of his restaurant locations in the region will be reopen on Friday. He said they are planning with the assumption they will be allowed to have more than 50 people if they properly space the tables, and will scale that plan down if the province states 50 is the maximum regardless of space.  “We definitely will open to whatever capacity is allowed, whether that’s 50 people or spaced appropriately,” he said. “We’re going to be prepared either way, but we’re anxiously awaiting the clarity.” In the eyes of longtime food critic and writer Andrew Coppolino, the question now turns to whether customers will show up. “There’s two different things at play here,” he said. “On the one hand, of course restaurants are going to be excited to reopen so they can pay the bills. But will customers use a month to watch and see what happens? We just don’t know how they are going to react.” Palubiski is hoping trends will continue.  Based on what he has seen with patio attendance, customers have been turning up in higher numbers week over week with the increased patio space.  “I’m optimistic,” he said. “We’ve been so gratified by the level of support we’ve received. I think people are going to want to go out and connect. I think people are going to want to feel normal again.”  More to come ..."

But the Kitchener man may have been truthful about one thing: He said he had advanced prostate cancer and was worried he would die in prison. McColl, 66, died on Sunday at Beaver Creek Institution in Gravenhurst “of apparent natural causes following an illness,” Correctional Service Canada said in a news release. “As in all cases involving the death of an inmate, Correctional Service Canada will review the circumstances.” McColl killed Kate Reid, 51, in her apartment on Burn Place, near the corner of Belmont Avenue West and Highland Road West, on Jan. 2, 2015. He was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced in 2017 to life in prison with no chance of parole for 13 years. McColl, who sublet a room in Reid’s apartment, struck her in the head with a hammer as many as 14 times and then concealed her body on her third-floor balcony, where it froze. He left her body there until late January, when he tossed it to the ground, dragged it near a dumpster and covered it with snow. Her body was not found until March 20, 2015. McColl continued living in the apartment for weeks after the killing. Reid, a former waitress who was on disability support, moved here years ago from New Brunswick. McColl, a former film producer and son of a United Church minister, maintained Reid came at him with a hunting knife in a dispute over rent. He said he struck her with the hammer in self-defence. The jury didn’t buy it. McColl admitted that after killing Reid, he impersonated her in a call to MasterCard to get a new PIN for her credit card. He used the card to buy two iPads and get money from an ATM. McColl also forged Reid’s signature on her cheques to pay bills to make it look like she was still alive and told Reid’s 17-year-old daughter her mom had gone to New Brunswick, even though Reid’s dead body was on the balcony. He then went about trying to cover up the crime, cutting up bloody parts of a couch and disposing of all of her belongings.  “Fifty-one years of memories, pictures and treasures thrown in the trash as garbage,” her sister, Leslie Reid, said at McColl’s sentencing hearing. “A small, red recipe book that Kate began when she was 13, filled with notes from her grandmother, is now lost forever because you wanted to erase a life. “For selfless reasons, you, Mr. McColl, not only killed my sister but you also murdered any chance of my family keeping a single physical reminder of Kate’s life in Ontario.”"

The woman was taken by ambulance to Hamilton General Hospital with serious injuries. The family dog was killed, said Sgt. Scott Griffiths of Waterloo Regional Police. The collision between the pedestrian and a garbage truck occurred at 8:45 a.m. in the area of Countryside Crescent and Tuerr Drive in Kitchener. Roads in the area will remain closed as Waterloo Regional Police continue to investigate.  Griffiths said officers are on scene and speaking to residents in the Country Hills neighbourhood who may have witnessed the crash between the pedestrian and the truck. Griffiths said officers will be canvassing the area. They are also looking for any video that neighbours may have captured of the crash. A commercial vehicle inspection will be conducted on the garbage truck, he said. Chaitram “Steve” Persaud, who lives on Tuerr Drive, said he was in the kitchen making coffee when he looked out his front window and saw someone lying on the ground along with a dog. “My neighbour was comforting the person,” said Persaud. Persaud said the woman struck is his neighbour across the street and “she is a very sweet lady.” He said he worries about drivers speeding on Tuerr Drive and motorists not fully stopping at the stop sign. Anyone with information on the crash is asked to call traffic services at 519-650-8500, ext. 8856. Emergency road signs are blocking off the area at Countryside Crescent and Tuerr Drive in the residential neighbourhood in the Country Hills area off Strasburg Road.  More to come. "

City council chose contractors Monday for portions of upgrades that will cost almost $10 million in total. The recreation complex on Parkside Drive is getting a skateboard park, basketball court, splash plaza, climbing structure, seating areas, and public art in the form of outdoor benches.  “I’m so excited,” Coun. Angela Vieth said. She figures it will turn the community centre, with its library and two ice pads, into more than a place for children who can afford to play hockey. The complex is part of a neighbourhood with lower incomes. “It’s getting closer to becoming what I would consider a community hub,” Vieth said. “It’s been a long time coming.”  The upgrade will go where visitors currently park in 33 spaces. Lost spaces will be replaced by new parking spaces elsewhere at the complex. Construction is to start this summer and largely finish by the fall.  At Silver Lake and Waterloo Park in the downtown, council intends to realign Laurel Creek, remove the aging Lion’s Lagoon water park, and dredge and reconfigure the lake. The park is getting new pathways, a new boardwalk, fountain features, and a beach area.  Work on Silver Lake is expected to start this month and conclude in six months, weather permitting. Work on Laurel Creek was approved in May. Other work on Waterloo Park is to be advertised this summer. It’s expected that the overall lake and park project will be completed by the fall of 2021.  Council also voted Monday to reduce more speed limits or install signs or traffic-calming measures as part of its bid to make streets friendlier to pedestrians and cyclists during the COVID-19 pandemic. Various changes will be made on Sundew Drive, in the Old Abbey Road neighbourhood, and Waterloo Street.  Speed limits past five schools will be reduced to 30 km/h within the Eastbridge and Westvale neighbourhoods. Council has reduced other streets in those neighbourhoods to 40 km/h. "

He was dropping his daughter off at her bus stop, and a neighbour had brought post cards raising concerns about water bottling permits to send to the Ontario Ministry of Environment. Today Case is the board chair for the Wellington Water Watchers and last week witnessed the ousting of Nestlé from the county. “Good for us that we raised enough of a stink to make it uncomfortable for Nestlé to do business here,” he says. “But let’s finish the job by pushing our government to start phasing out permits to take water for bottling completely,” Case says. “It’s great Nestlé is leaving, but it’s still the same problem.” The sale of the Nestlé infrastructure to Ice River Springs water bottling company is still under review by the Competition Bureau of Canada, the federal organization that reviews all company sales to protect competition in the marketplace. Case speculates that once Ice River Springs takes over Nestle’s Ontario plants and well, they’ll have a monopoly on water bottling in the province.  Ice River Springs, a private company, portrays itself as a family-owned business invested in sustainability and environment. The company says all their bottles are made from 100 per cent recycled plastic made at their Shelburne recycling plant and plans to do the same at the former Nestlé plants. They report they use 85 per cent of the PET recycled material in Ontario’s blue box program.  Sandy Gott, Ice River Springs’ executive VP and co-owner says the company has invested $30 million in plastics recycling, and takes in 65 million pounds of plastic per year. But Case doesn’t buy it. “It looks like a lot of greenwashing if you ask me,” he says. “Water doesn’t require plastic.” Though he admits, “It’s interesting that they’ve found ways to recycle plastic.”  The Grand River Source Water Protection Committee and Centre Wellington, a township next to the Middlebrook well, reported in May that private permits to take water do not have a major impact on municipal water levels, because they are usually too far from municipal wells. But Case feels this misses the point. “I approach it with a more precautionary, conservation lens,” he says. “The question of affecting water flows is only one part of the equation.” Case feels that regardless of the amount of water taken, people need to ask why the water is being taken, for whose benefit and at what cost. “Water is for life, not profit,” he says. The sale involves all of Nestle’s Purelife brand bottled water infrastructure including a factory in Puslinch, Ontario and Hope, BC, as well as the Middlebrook well in Erin, Ontario."

The woman announced to her estranged husband in late June that she and their five-year-old daughter were flying to San Antonio on July 6. The woman’s boyfriend lives in Texas. The girl resides primarily with her mother but spends alternate weekends with her father. Neither parent has sole decision-making powers over their child. The father opposed the U.S. trip and the case went to court. “The COVID-19 situation causes significant concern for father vis-à-vis the possibility of (the child) being exposed to the virus,” Superior Court Justice Jennifer Breithaupt Smith wrote in a ruling on July 2, four days before the proposed trip. The judge also noted that after returning to Canada, the child would have to self-isolate for two weeks. “This will result in further periods of missed parenting time between father and (the child),” the judge wrote, adding the girl will “effectively be denied parenting time with her father for the full month of July.” Breithaupt Smith said she would deny the Texas trip even without a pandemic. “This is in fact simply a case of inappropriate unilateral decision-making by one parent to the detriment of the other, and by extension of the child,” she said “COVID-19 adds a layer of desperation to the matter, but ... mother must receive the clear message that her actions would not be tolerated even if COVID-19 were not a factor.” The parents separated in 2018. The man had told his estranged wife he wanted to spend more time with their daughter. Text messages in late June had a “nasty” tone after the woman told him about the Texas trip, the judge said. Father: “You have put (our child) in a very bad situation because of your personal needs.” Mother: “Lol. Well since it’s a pandemic I guess she’ll have to isolate with me until it’s over. Thank you goodbye.” She went on to say: “We’ll be issuing a court order for permission to travel. You won’t have a say in this anymore.” The judge said the woman has previously travelled to the U.S. with her daughter without the father’s advance consent. When the trip took place was not specified. “International travel during a period of closed or uncertain border controls between a child’s habitual residence and the country being visited requires unequivocal agreement of both parents based upon a clear and collaborative plan,” Breithaupt Smith said. “It is not a decision that can be unilaterally made by one parent over the other’s objections, particularly where all parenting issues are the subject of active litigation.” Breithaupt Smith ruled neither parent can take the child out of Canada without the written consent of the other or a court order. The judge ordered the girl’s passport be deposited with the office of the father’s lawyer and said it “shall be retained there until it is released upon the written consent of the parties or further order of the court.”"

On July 9, pair of youths from Guelph and Kitchener — both 14 years old females — were at Turkey Point Beach, when they met a group of people they didn’t know from Brantford. They were invited back to a vehicle where they consumed drugs, Norfolk County OPP said. The teenagers returned to the beach but started feeling sick. A concerned passerby called 911 when they saw the pair vomiting and falling asleep. They were taken to hospital for treatment and have since been released. Media relations officer Const. Ed Sanchuk said it’s not known what substance these youth were given or who led them over to the vehicle. Police are asking anyone with information to contact the OPP at 1-888-310-1122, or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.

But her application was rejected three times by the Ontario government. Each time, a white businessperson was chosen instead. Hogarth is Black. She is a professor of social work whose research focuses on race and discrimination. For several years, she worked closely with Waterloo Regional Police Chief Bryan Larkin. “We talked about race, we talked a lot about discrimination, we talked about diversifying the police force,” said Hogarth, who teaches at Renison University College at the University of Waterloo. She had discussions with Larkin, too, after a 2016 investigation by the Record’s Jeff Outhit discovered that Black people were four times more likely to be stopped and questioned by police, without being accused of a crime, than white people were. So “I don’t know what makes me unsuitable” to join the police board, she said. It is painfully obvious that someone with Hogarth’s background would be ideal to help steer the changes that are needed for the police. Across North America, police are under a microscope as never before. Communities have erupted for six weeks over systemic racism against Black people. It started after the murder of an African-American man, George Floyd, by a white police officer in Minneapolis on May 25. But, as dreadful as it was, Floyd’s fate was only the last straw of a long, heavy, painful history of violence against Black people. Waterloo Region is part of this. The Black Lives Matter demonstration in downtown Kitchener on June 3 brought thousands of people together, demanding less funding for police and more for social agencies that could better help people who are in mental health crisis, who are homeless, poor or racialized. After that march, Regional Chair Karen Redman, who also chairs the police board, advocated for a Black person to be appointed to the remaining vacant position.  There are seven people on the police board. Three are elected regional councillors, all white. One is Rosita Tse, who is Waterloo Region’s appointment and the only non-white person. Three others are selected by the province. This year, the province appointed three white people to the board: Ian McLean, president of the Greater Kitchener Waterloo Chamber of Commerce. Tony Giovinazzo, chief executive officer of Activa. And most recently, Karin Schnarr, business professor at Wilfrid Laurier University. They have many skills and experiences. But none of them is an expert on racism. None of them could possibly understand what it is like to be followed more often, stopped more often, to be more fearful of violence from the armed keepers of public order — only because of your skin colour. Some Black activists have said there should not be a Black person on the police board, that this person would never be anything more than a token, forced to be part of a team that takes no significant action. Hogarth doesn’t agree. “If we are having a Black person on a police board as a token, then we don’t need to be there,” she said. “If, however, you are even remotely interested in change, then absolutely, get us there. “Your participation is severely limited if you are not represented.” The provincial Lieutenant Governor makes the selections for police board appointments. Hogarth never received a letter advising her that she had been rejected, or explaining why she had not been chosen. A full month after the Black Lives Matter demonstration in Kitchener, the province announced Schnarr’s appointment. There can only be two reasons for yet another white person to have been named to the police board. One is if there just weren’t any qualified Black candidates for the position. Thanks to Hogarth’s application, we know that isn’t true. That leaves the other explanation: That the selection process is itself part of a culture of systemic racism and white supremacy. Clearly, this process needs to change. Local residents — the people who are actually being policed — should be the ones to decide, through local elections, who is chosen to oversee the police service. Not the remote, unresponsive provincial government. "

An 81-year-old man on a three-wheeled electric scooter was charged with impaired driving. His driver’s licence was suspended for 90 days. He has a court date in November. Holy smokes! On July 5 police pulled over two vehicles on Highway 17 near Dryden, between Thunder Bay and Winnipeg, and seized $1.6 million worth of illegal cigarettes. OPP found 386 cases of smokes. A case holds 50 cartons and a carton has 200 cigarettes, so if our math is correct, that’s 3.8 million cigarettes. Three people from Winnipeg and one from Brampton, ranging in age from 27 to 40, were charged with trafficking in contraband tobacco. Human powder keg Three young adults in Meaford, 40 kilometres northwest of Collingwood, were attacked after they set off fireworks on the night of July 4. A man allegedly struck them in the shoulder area with a baseball bat and then used it to smash windows of multiple vehicles. Two of the victims were treated at hospital. The attack happened when the three men returned to a cottage after setting off fireworks at a nearby lake. A Meaford man, 72, was charged with assault with a weapon and mischief. Facing the music If you are breaking a condition of your release from court, blasting music from your car in front of the police station may be ill-advised. On June 30 at 6:30 p.m., an officer heard loud music and yelling from a car parked beside the OPP detachment in Clinton, 20 kilometres southeast of Goderich. Two people were in the car. Turns out a condition of their release from a previous alleged crime was to have no contact with each other. A London woman, 21, and a London youth were charged with failing to comply with a release condition. Driver flees with children in car A man faces 18 charges after he fled in his car at a RIDE checkpoint. On June 27 at 2 a.m., a car with two adults and four children, all under 12, was stopped on Highway 11 in Kapuskasing, 170 kilometres northwest of Timmins. The driver took off in the car, almost hitting officers. Police located the car but it was empty. All six were later found in a trailer. The driver, 31, of Arran-Elderslie, Ont., faces a slew of charges, including fleeing police, dangerous driving and driving while a child passenger is not properly secured. The other adult, 25, of Tara, Ont., faces seven charges, including making a false statement and obstructing police. Family and Children’s Services was notified.  Beer in cup holder, kids in back seat On July 1 at 1:15 p.m., a citizen told Caledon OPP a car on Highway 10 was crossing into oncoming lanes. Police clocked the driver at 127 km/h in an 80 zone. “As the officer approached the vehicle, he observed an open beer bottle in a cup holder between the front seats,” police said. “Two small children, age one and three, were seated in the back with an adult passenger.” An Edmonton man, 31, was charged with impaired driving, speeding and driving with an open container of alcohol. “Peel Children’s Aid was notified to follow up on the incident,” OPP said. Not jumping for joy OPP injected a pun into the report of a June 28 theft in Exeter, 25 kilometres east of Grand Bend. A trampoline mat and all the springs were stolen. “The property owners woke up the next morning to find the frame sitting in the backyard and nothing more,” police said. “Seems like a lot of work for a relatively low payoff, but these thieves jumped at the chance to get themselves a used trampoline mat. Huron OPP is hopeful to receive some tips from the public to help solve this rather unusual theft.” Give me your car or I’ll ...

As society sticks its toe back into the proverbial wading pool — and literally in the real ones — four months into the COVID lockdown, Waterloo Region’s new masking bylaws mandate that, like Hannibal Lecter and The Green Hornet, everyone must cover their face in indoor public settings. When it kicks in Monday there will, of course, be exemptions for age, health, disabilities. But it’s an unexpected pivot that — while crucial in controlling the virus’s spread — has all sorts of cultural implications. On this week’s panel, four of the region’s deep thinkers contemplate a world undercover, where bank robbers, citizens and Jason from “Friday the 13th” blend indiscriminately, with the alluring prospect of a Victorian-styled resurgence in personal modesty: “I can’t show my face — I might cough.” On hand to sort through this psychological morass: radio personalities Angie Hill and Mike Farwell, pop culture priestess Isabel Kuxdorf and University of Waterloo history prof Andrew Hunt.  As someone who believes everything I read on Twitter, I want to cut to the chase: is this a government conspiracy to erode our freedoms and destroy democracy?  Farwell: If it is, governments really need to aim higher than “put this piece of cloth on your face!” Hunt: I saw a video a few days ago about a U.S. woman yelling that face masks were a “Deep State” plot to take away our freedoms. I thought “If this is what totalitarianism 2020-style looks like, we’re gonna have a pretty easy ride compared to people who lived under dictatorships in the last century.” Kuxdorf: Folks, the mask will not erode your freedom. Leave that to the Tech giants and Lobbyists. I sense skepticism, but in Toronto last week, subway protesters chanted “hugs over mask, we don’t have to ask!” Freedom fighting aside, how much do you want an unsolicited hug from a stranger with COVID? Farwell: If I’m going down from COVID, I’m going down hugging. Hunt: I think I’ll take a Pasadena on the Free Hugs Movement. I wasn’t into it pre-COVID. If that makes me Mr. Square, so be it. Hill: Never … Ever … get off me! Jump back six months. You walk into a bank and see someone wearing a mask. What’s your reaction? Hill: Call the cops ... potential robbery Hunt: “I demand fifteen thousand dollars and a 707 to Havana! No, make that twenty thousand!” Is it permissible to yell at someone if you see their nose peeking over the top of their mask? Hunt: No way! It gives them a sort of nonconformist street cred.  Given the exemptions for medical conditions, kids under five, no proof required, why would anyone wear a mask? Farwell: Because they want to feel a part of our pandemic recovery and because, believe it or not, they actually care about other people. Hill: Better safe than sorry — kind of like that kid who doesn’t believe in Santa Claus and gets nothing … you wanna take THAT chance???? You radio people are so rule-abiding. Hunt: This might be like the big controversy over mandatory seatbelt laws back in the ’80s. It calmed down after people realized that if you don’t wear one, you go flying through the windshield face-first into a utility pole. Isabel, you see other benefits?  Kuxdorf: Free facial. Your constant breathing creates a steam bath for your face. Gross but truly pore-opening! Tell me more. Kuxdorf: Think of the money we’ll save on lip plumpers, glosses and facial waxing. We can use masks to hide imperfections, as in the Victorian fan, which among other uses, was used to hide bad teeth. For wheezing gasbags like myself, breathing difficulties kick in after 10 minutes. What impact will this have on shopping? Farwell: Ten minutes? That’s Ironman territory. If there’s any impact on shopping, my guess is it’s on those who won’t enter a store if they don’t see people inside wearing masks. Shoppers gonna shop. Hunt: I overheat. As a result, I get disoriented when I’m shopping. I end up buying things I wouldn’t ordinarily buy, like tiny cocktail parasols and exotic dragon fruits and People magazine. Hill: It’ll make people less likely to browse and more pick it up and run.  Should Halloween masks be considered appropriate protection under the new bylaw? If so, who would you be? Hill: The old man from The Muppets ... and I’d demand the senior discount.  Hunt: I’d dig one of those big dome helmets from “Alien,” complete with a built-in face hugger. Kuxdorf: I find it ironic that Halloween masks were banned in schools but now they’re going to be REQUIRED. You can now officially run around like an upside down Zorro — any day of the year. What about incorporating space helmets? I’m thinking Matt Damon in “The Martian.”  Farwell: Oddly enough, I’m thinking of The Great Gazoo. Is that a “Flintstones” reference? You gotta move into the 21st century, man. I say that as someone who patterned his life after Potsie in “Happy Days.” Kuxdorf: Our governments could generate much needed revenue by selling masks with provincial or state mottos. Wouldn’t you like to run around with Ontario’s new “Open for Business” on your face?  Bylaw enforcement will be complaint driven. I have a neighbour who calls the snitch line if our tree branch hangs an inch too low. Would this be a good opportunity to exact revenge?  Farwell: We’ll bitch about it on Facebook, but actually taking the time to call someone official? You have to remember people are generally really, really good. It’s just that those who are less good make a lot of noise. Hunt: Any means of exacting petty revenge, I’m all for. Is there a danger of getting so comfortable wearing a mask you may not want to take it off? Farwell: Is it September 30th yet? Because as much as I’m willing to do my part, I don’t love wearing a mask. I’m looking forward to our bylaw’s sunset clause and release from the shackles of facial fabric. Hunt: My son made me a mask when the pandemic first hit in March. Not only is it comfy, I have a strong sentimental attachment. Ah, those poignant pandemic moments! At what point do you say “To hell with nose hair/blemishes/washing my face?” Farwell: I’m pretty sure for me that point was 1989. When you look at People magazine and see photos of celebrities strolling along exotic beaches wearing masks, does this justify its $5.99 cover price? Kuxdorf: If this spells the end to the “Instagram pucker” popularized by Kim Kardashian, now seen in school yearbook photos everywhere, then I’m all for it. Can we make mask wearing a requirement on social media? Hunt: The celebrity in question has to be pretty damn cool to sway me. Hardcore cool — the level of Abdul ‘Duke’ Fakir, the last surviving member of The Four Tops. Or Fox Mulder and Dana Scully cool. Or legendary Mad magazine artist Al Jaffee, who recently retired at age 99. You history profs and your pop culture Easter eggs. Wikipedia! Hunt: If you see a guy in the grocery store wearing an Immortan Joe mask from “Mad Max: Fury Road,” don’t be scared. He’s just there for Ruffles and Diet Coke."

The test was originally scheduled for August, but when Rendle received a call from the hospital a few weeks ago, she was optimistic there had been some cancellations and she would get in sooner. Instead, she was told that her test is currently deemed non-essential and the date had been cancelled indefinitely, due to the backlog caused by restrictions in place for the COVID-19 pandemic. “I can’t tell you how many nights I’ve been awake with pain and got down on my knees and just said ‘Please, I just need an answer.’ Then I have this MRI two months away and my hopes are crushed and there’s no hope in sight,” Rendle said. “I’m just desperate. This has really interfered with my quality of life.” On May 26, Ontario said hospitals could resume elective and non-essential surgeries and clinical activities put on hold in March, providing the hospitals met certain criteria. This included appropriate staffing levels, sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) and maintaining an adequate hospital occupancy level. While Cambridge Memorial Hospital is making a gradual return to resuming these services, Sandra Hett, vice-president of clinical programs and chief nursing executive, said it’s “not business as usual yet.” That will likely be the case across Ontario for what could be longer than a year, Dr. Samantha Hill, president of the Ontario Medical Association said. Hospitals can’t get to the levels they were at before COVID because they still need to maintain precautions, Hill said. “That means spacing patients farther apart, that means a deeper clean between patients, it means everything takes longer to be done safely,” she said. “So you started with a system that already had wait lists, hallway medicine, et cetera, and it keeps getting worse.” In May, hospitals were to submit a plan to public health prior to resuming elective services, including a plan to book patients based on a prioritization scale. Hett said this scale is determined by Cancer Care Ontario Grand River and St. Mary’s hospitals confirm they are also undergoing similar processes. Lee Fairclough, president of St. Mary’s and Waterloo Wellington hospital lead for the pandemic response, said triaging and rescheduling will occur over many months and will be based on bed capacity. “This process has always existed, and there are times when procedures and surgeries unfortunately need to be postponed to accommodate more urgent and emergent cases,” she said.  “Under the new reality of COVID-19, some bed capacity must be maintained in case there is a surge in COVID cases, and hospitals must also have sufficient personal protective and other equipment, medications and human resources,” Fairclough said. In an email to the Cambridge Times, Ontario Health said it recognizes this is a difficult and distressing time, especially for patients waiting to receive the services they require; however, addressing the backlog will require different timing from hospital to hospital. Hill said that the best course of action at this point would be to get the Ministry of Health, government officials and representatives from the Ontario Medical Association to come together to work through the current problem. “It’s a real crisis. It’s not something that there is an easy answer for,” she said. “There are mitigating options that we can apply, but we need to figure it out together.” With files from Perth Courier."

The latest comet to blaze across the night sky will be visible just after 10 p.m. each night for the next little while.  “I could see this one in the city, which makes it special,” said Ellen Papenburg, a local amateur astronomer and member of the Kitchener-Waterloo Astronomy Club.  NEOWISE isn’t as bright as some of the comets Papenburg has seen in 50 years of skygazing, but it is still a pleasant surprise after two promising comets, Atlas and Swan, disintegrated before they got close enough to the earth to see. “Comets are quite fickle,” Papenburg said. “I compare comets with cats. They do what they want and they have tails.” That is why it is such a delight to be able to spot one so easily. Papenburg was able to see NEOWISE from her downtown Kitchener home with a pair of binoculars, and then again with a friend early one morning. It has been seven years since she has seen a comet with the naked eye.  Last week, Papenburg woke up at 3 a.m. to go out and find NEOWISE with a friend. The comet was only visible in the early hours of the morning then.  “It was worth it,” she said. “I’m not a morning person so I’m glad it will be visible in the evening now.”  Papenburg has spent most of her life chasing these celestial objects.  “They are like dirty snowballs. They are made of rock and ice and frozen gases,” she said.  She has seen between 15 and 20 comets in her lifetime. Her love for these fickle balls of rock and ice began with her first comet sighting at 16 years old. It was 1970 and she was living in Holland when she watched Comet Bennett brighten in the night sky.  She was hooked after that. Her favourite one was Comet West in 1976.  “That one was so big,” she said. “It had such a long tail it took up almost one-sixth of the sky.”  “I’m still waiting on another one like that.” NEOWISE is about the width of a fist above the northwest horizon, just below the Big Dipper. It will be climbing upward in the coming weeks which also means it will become dimmer in the sky — catch a glimpse before it’s too late.  It was discovered by the Near-Earth Object Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) space telescope on March 27.

They urge everyone in Waterloo Region to watch out for each other to prevent a rise in family violence during this unprecedented and stressful time. “There is so much that can be done just by reaching out to people,” said Karen Spencer, executive director of Family & Children’s Services of the Waterloo Region. Several agencies have joined together to launch the Keep Families Safe campaign to raise awareness about the danger of violence against women and children due to the isolation and stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  “This is still a dangerous time for women and for families,” said Jennifer Hutton, chief executive officer of Women’s Crisis Services of Waterloo Region. Reaching out for help may not be safe for many in abusive homes, and pandemic restrictions mean people are out less in the community where others can spot warning signs. Usually the shelters are full or close to full, but at the pandemic’s start that dropped to about half and calls were also down. Since the region moved into Stage 2 of the reopening plan and added opportunities to leave the home make reaching out easier, more women are seeking safe refuge.  “There is some relief that we’re seeing more,” Hutton said. “We’re still not at what would be typical for us.” That worries her because the current situation points to an escalation of family violence, not a decrease.  The agency added an online chat feature to its website as a discrete way for women to reach out for help. Hutton said it’s seeing good use, with one family reporting they could come into shelter because that option was available.  Normally, Hutton said it is difficult for women to leave an abusive situation but the pandemic has added other barriers to overcome, including uncertainty for the future.  “So then it’s hard to make such a major decision about taking your kids and going into a shelter,” she said. At Family & Children’s Services, calls were down at the start of the pandemic while police were responding to more. But now referrals are back to normal levels and that’s lessened the fear about unreported family violence. “There isn’t that same worry that people aren’t calling us to report concerns about a child’s safety or to request help,” Spencer said.  The agency relies on the community for early intervention because they’re called when something happens to a child or there’s a serious concern about well-being. Spencer is thankful people are looking out for their neighbours, and families are being connected to available support from food hampers to counselling. “I would say the community has really pulled together to make sure families don’t fall through the cracks and get the help they need,” Spencer said. “That’s been a collective community effort.” She hopes that continues, emphasizing that a listening ear or helping hand go a long way to ensure families have what they need to survive this stressful time. There’s a link between a lack of support networks and child welfare concerns, Spencer said. “A lot can be done to prevent child abuse and neglect by simply reaching out.”"
18,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/news/waterloo-region/2020/07/13/neighbours-oppose-housing-proposal-in-beechwood-neighbourhood.html,Neighbours oppose housing proposal in Beechwood neighbourhood,['Bill Jackson'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","WATERLOO — Ray Pearce has lived in Beechwood for more than 30 years and said no one living in the single-family homes across from 555 Beechwood Dr. ever thought the property would be used for an apartment building. The sloped parcel of green space was used for a pumping station until 2016 and has served as passive park space for as long as Pearce can recall. The region recently announced plans to declare the property surplus and issue a request for proposals, requiring future owner(s) to create affordable housing in a building of up to six storeys under current zoning on the land. “They are talking about many, many units — 250 bedrooms,” Pearce said. His wife Lyn noted there are plans for a 12-storey apartment building at 508 Beechwood Dr. and more affordable housing is also proposed as part of an existing housing co-op at 693 Beechwod Dr. “In a short period of time you could be looking at 1,000 more people on this tiny little road,” she said. According to the region’s manager of housing programs and development, Jennifer Murdoch-Martin, the city rezoned the property in 2005 to medium density as part of its nodes and corridors study to permit future residential intensification. Michelle Lee, senior policy planner with the city, said Erb Street West was identified as a minor corridor and various properties on the periphery of established neighbourhoods, and adjacent to public transportation, were identified for intensification. Lee said it was a five-year study involving mail-outs to neighbourhood associations, more than 10 open houses and significant public input, but acknowledged that making residents aware of high-level policy decisions can be challenging. Residents of Beechwood said they were never made aware. The Pearces spread the word after receiving a pamphlet about the project advertising two town halls. “Hello Neighbours!” the pamphlet read. “It takes a community to create homes for all; and while nearly 5,000 individuals and families anxiously wait for affordable housing, your community has an opportunity to make an impact.” Dozens of people attended the two Zoom meetings and the majority are against the proposal, residents contend. According to those who took part in the virtual town hall meetings, they got quite animated, with some accused of being bigots after speaking out in opposition. “(One person) was saying, ‘You’re just against low-income housing,’ and people got really offended and mad, because that’s not the focus of this,” Lyn said.  “It feels like they’re doing this in a bubble — that they’re really not paying attention to the neighbourhood around them,” Lyn said. The decision to declare the land surplus is expected to be made at regional council on July 15. The RFP would be issued later in the month, with the selected proposal coming back to council in September. Regional Coun. Jim Erb, chair of the region’s housing and homelessness steering committee, said the design still needs to be determined and public engagement is ongoing. Erb believes residents have valid concerns relating to building height and traffic, but many residents, including the Westminister United Church next door, support the project, he said. “The zoning permits six storeys; that’s not to say that will be the actual height.” Parkland is to be incorporated. Erb noted the new units in Waterloo would not be classified as supportive housing, but the region — with more than 5,000 people on a waiting list — sees the property as an opportunity to move the needle on affordable housing,"

The boys would light warming fires at the pond’s edge and illuminate the surface by lantern so they could skate themselves into exhaustion. For Irene Bitschy, these were special childhood memories of the 1910s, memories that would only become more colourful as she grew up. Born Irene Harnack on Oct. 18, 1914, on a Shantz Station farm, she was the middle kid in a family of nine. Irene was born months after the outbreak of the First World War and in her 10 decades, she would live through many world events including the Spanish Flu epidemic and Prohibition. Her life became really interesting and a little subversive during the latter. At age 14, Irene took a job at her aunt’s hotel in downtown Kitchener. Thanks to overzealous temperance workers, Prohibition was in full force by 1916, banning the serving of alcohol in public places. So it simply went underground, or in the case of the Kitchener hotel, it went up into a laundry basket. Irene’s main job at the hotel was to wash and iron linens in a second-floor room but she had another, equally important role. The hotel posted a guard at the street entrance and when he spotted police heading toward the hotel for a raid, a chain of events began: the men inside gathered up the liquor and knocked on the ceiling. A trap door would suddenly open, Irene would drop her laundry basket down the hole for the men to place the offending liquor in, then she’d haul it up, close the door and hide the bottles under sheets. Irene admitted that this was the scariest time of her life, always living on the edge, always facing the possibility of arrest. Life on the farm was also somewhat risky. Her father, Joseph Harnack, ran a still on the farm and he was lucky to have a pal on the police force who alerted him to planned raids which would have ruined his bootleg operation. Irene had remembered that times were desperate, her father had many mouths to feed and limited options. There were happy times as well on the farm. Picnics and garden parties were frequent, and it was at one of these events at the Harnack home that Irene met William Bitschy, from Maryhill. William was quite smitten by the pretty Irene, but she wasn’t exactly feeling the same. Uncomfortable with his attentions, Irene left the party and hid in her room. William had to take a different tack. He danced with her grandmother and convinced her to intervene on his behalf. It must have worked because Irene agreed to go out with him and the two married in Kitchener in April 1935. Bill’s priest in Maryhill had refused to marry the couple, given Irene was not a parishioner, so they married in Kitchener. With the Depression in full swing, the newlywed’s wedding brunch was surprisingly generous, serving a rare treat of hotdogs. The young couple honeymooned in Niagara Falls and would go on to have four daughters: Charlotte, Sheila, Marlene and Lynda. In the early part of their marriage, the couple lived at a gas station. Irene served ice cream and pumped gas while Bill delivered coal. They later moved to Breslau where they lived for five years before purchasing a farm. Irene was back to farm life, working alongside her husband. In 1953, Bill landed a job with CN Railway and four years later, the couple moved to Kitchener. With four daughters to raise, Irene was a stay-at-home mom until she learned about a new residence opening at the University of Waterloo. They were looking for a “house mom” to help students, many who were on their own for the first time. Several were foreign students and these kids were often invited for dinner with Irene and Bill, easing their homesickness. Irene retired in 1975 and in 1988, Bill died. Always stoic, Irene sold the family home and moved to an apartment. In 1990, at 76, Irene boarded her first airplane, for an Alaskan adventure. Lynda Tranebo said her mother was kind and loving. “She would do anything for anybody.” Irene was also an exceptional cook, particularly potato salad and popcorn balls that she made every Halloween for dozens of neighbourhood kids. In May, Irene was diagnosed with COVID-19 and made local headlines when the nursing home moved her to hospital for more intensive care. Though she didn’t exhibit symptoms, the illness did weaken her organs. Irene died May 22, 2020, at 105."

Manager Josh Williamson said graffiti on the Kitchener store’s wall facing King Street is a common occurrence, with the latest spray-painted message appearing on Canada Day. That got him thinking that maybe the graffiti could be covered with a mural for everyone passing by to enjoy. “It’s always been in the back of my mind,” Williamson said. “I think we can really make this a good project for the community going forward.” He wants to partner with artists to create removable murals that will be auctioned off for charity once a year. The unique art would fill the four sections at the front of the building, now blank canvasses that attract graffiti.  Williamson put his idea out on Twitter and the response was overwhelming as artists expressed interest and others made recommendations. One spot is already reserved for art students from nearby Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate. He’s talking with local companies to create lighted enclosures to protect the art, and other companies have contacted him asking how they can help. The details aren’t all nailed down yet, and Williamson welcomes suggestions with the aim of having a September unveiling for the first creations.  “I think it could be ongoing to hopefully get that positive message yearly,” he said. “I’m just really excited for the potential.”"

Kitchener Mayor Berry Vrbanovic, who introduced the motion at regional council calling for mandatory face coverings, said wearing a mask is the “ultimate sign of caring for your neighbour.” “We have a long history of both being a resilient community, but more importantly being a very caring and compassionate community,” Vrbanovic said. “I hope people will put that hat on, along with their mask.” He said the bylaws will make sure the region can continue to move forward, and people can get back as much a sense of normalcy as possible in their lives. Some view the bylaws as infringing on their rights, but Vrbanovic pointed out the flip side of that argument.  “With rights also comes our collective responsibility toward each other and our community,” he said. “Your decision to wear a mask will actually help to save lives … Together let’s look out for our community.” Coun. Tom Galloway, who supported mandatory masks from the start, thinks most people will follow the new requirement.  “There are going to be people who might cheat, feign an exemption, but that will be a small number of people,” Galloway said. He said the bylaws are imperfect, but they will help keep the curve flat to avoid closing things again and move to the next stage of reopening as soon as possible. The Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Health Unit made face coverings mandatory inside any commercial or retail establishment in mid-June, when both that area and Waterloo Region moved into Stage 2. Galloway said Guelph has about a 90 per cent compliance rate — and that’s a good goal for here. “That’s going to go a long way,” Galloway said. People are asking why now when local numbers are low, and not months ago. “We are doing well and we want to keep it that way,” Galloway said.  He is concerned that people who are exempt will stay home to avoid confrontations with others who may be bothered they’re not wearing one, but he stressed that some have legitimate reasons.  “There’s no need for individuals to self-enforce this,” he said. “People generally are law abiding.” People who are unable to wear a mask due to a medical condition or disability and children under five are exempt from wearing a face covering, defined as a medical or non-medical mask or other face covering, including a bandana, scarf or other fabric that covers the nose, mouth and chin. Regional Chair Karen Redman stressed that the bylaw does not require someone to show proof of exemption, and many health issues and disabilities are invisible.  “If you see someone not wearing a mask, assume they have a medical reason,” she said. Regional council voted unanimously last Monday night to pass two bylaws requiring face coverings on transit and in indoor public settings. Delegations took 3.5 hours at the start of the special council meeting, arguing both for and against a mask rule. “There’s strong views on all sides,” said chief administrative officer Mike Murray at Friday’s briefing. He said bylaws passed by council was a more democratic route that allowed public input, compared to “just issuing and edict.” “That’s a pretty robust process and it provides an opportunity for the community to weigh in, and it provides an opportunity for our elected officials to make an appropriate policy decision,” Murray said. “I’m hopeful that because of that public process that the community will be supportive of the direction that the regional council has taken.” The bylaws are in effect until Sept. 30, unless extended by council. They will be enforced by complaints.  Signs must be posted at entrances to all public spaces where masks are required. In the Guelph area, businesses were required to enforce the rule or face a hefty fine.  Acting medical officer of health Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang appreciates the bylaws here make it clear everyone is responsible for reducing the spread of COVID-19. “I was really pleased to see the bylaws that are passed does put the responsibility on all of us who can wear masks to wear masks, reinforcing what we’ve been trying to say all along which is that it’s a collective responsibility for us to protect each other,” Wang said. Redman said the region needs to find “the new normal,” and council believes wearing a mask is part of that.  “This is an important step in helping our region safely reopen and move from Stage 2 to Stage 3 in the near future,” Redman said. “When we keep our germs from others by wearing a mask, we help reduce the virus from spreading. It’s a simple and inexpensive action that we can take to take care of each other.” Find out more about the bylaws at regionofwaterloo.ca/en/face-covering-by-law.aspx."

Vuorinen, the conductor of the Grand Philharmonic Choir in Kitchener, artistic director of the Elora Festival and conductor of the Elora Festival Singers, wants health officials and governments to make evidence-based decisions about how and when choirs can resume practising, and perhaps performing live shows streamed to online audiences from empty halls. And to begin with, the focus should be on professional choirs, a tiny minority among the 3.5 million choir singers across the country, said Vuorinen. The COVID-19 pandemic silenced all of them in March.  The internationally renowned Elora Festival normally runs for three weeks in July, but it was cancelled. An online version is scheduled for early August. Professional choir singers rehearse or perform daily during the three-week long festival, and they earn a significant part of their annual income from it. So, Choirs Ontario and Vuorinen want public health officials and governments to start thinking about how to get professional choirs safely back to work. “As the other parts of our society, our economy open up we just want to signal our desire to have a conversation,” said Vuorinen, who chairs the music program at Conrad Grebel University College at the University of Waterloo. As a result, Choirs Ontario have published an open letter calling on governments to make decisions based on medical evidence when ruling if and how choirs can resume practising and performing.  “Scientific study on the transmission of COVID-19 as it relates to singing is in its infancy. To date, there is no body of scientific research that definitively links choral singing with a higher risk of infection in comparison to other group activities,” says the letter. “As such, it is of great concern to choral communities that the development of Ontario public health policy around the safety of singing could be based on anecdotal evidence of a few choirs whose membership has become sick, rather than being firmly based on scientific evidence,” says the letter. The letter is referring to a COVID-19 outbreak among members of the Skagit Valley Chorale in Washington State. On March 6 and March 10 choir members gathered for practice. Some sat close together, some further apart. They had cookies and drinks during a break. Skagit County issued social distancing guidelines on the day of the last rehearsal. An investigation by the Skagit Country Public Health department concluded one person with COVID-19 attended the rehearsals and infected 53 others (33 confirmed, 20 probable). Two members died. COVID-19 outbreaks also struck choirs in Berlin, England and Amsterdam. Maybe with research, choirs could resume practising with Plexiglas shields between members, have fewer singers at rehearsals with two metres between everyone, and have everyone wear masks while singing. “But then of course the big question is: ‘How do you then come together to perform?’” said Vuorinen.  The live streaming concerts to online audiences is used by a growing list of performers during the pandemic, and some countries allow choirs to do that, he said. “I have been able to tune into some of my favourite choirs in Europe and listen to them sing, in ways that I would not have otherwise,” said Vuorinen. “It’s a bit of an exciting opportunity in a way, to think about how can we reach a different audience in a different way,” said Vuorinen. “Live streaming or recording and streaming concerts is one way we are all going to need to adopt.” Vuorinen said the open letter and his comments are about finding ways for professional choirs to resume work. “In Ontario what we are hoping is the government will take a good look at this and help devise guidelines that we can use,” said Vuorinen."

Ontario's Workplace Safety and Insurance Board is reviewing more than 300 previously rejected compensation claims from retirees or their surviving families. The review was ordered last December by WSIB chair Elizabeth Witmer, who was concerned by stories of a cluster of cancer and lung disease among workers exposed to carcinogens in Kitchener's rubber manufacturing industry.  Former workers and their widows say they're angry and deflated after getting calls informing them that after taking a second look, WSIB is sticking with its original rejections of their cases. ""They failed us again. These men, they built this city, they built this province,"" said Kitchener's Gayle Wannan. ""Did their deaths not mean anything?"" Her late husband, Lynden Wannan, worked at Uniroyal for 26 years and died of pancreatic cancer at age 49 after collapsing on the factory floor. She's convinced the chemicals he worked with played a role in his early death.  Wannan says the WSIB, which told her last week it's upholding its original decision to deny compensation, is out of touch with the hardships the workers' deaths have caused many local families. ""They're not in our shoes,"" she said. ""If I have to wait for another appeal, I'll be dead by then."" The WSIB said some claims have been overturned as a result of the review, but was not able to say how many.  ""In conducting our review, we have been able to allow some previously denied claims based on new information, scientific research or information that has changed since the date of the original decision,"" board spokesperson Christine Arnott said in a statement.  ""We want people to receive any benefits and services they are entitled to, and we have to base our decisions on scientific evidence. Unfortunately, in some cases conclusive scientific evidence linking diseases to workplace exposures does not exist."" Dave Schneider, a 79-year-old who began working at BF Goodrich in his 20s, was also told his claim for throat cancer was rejected - again. The physician who studied his case, Dr. Mike Pysklywec, argued Schneider's exposure to carcinogens in the rubber industry was a significant contributing factor with his cancer. But since the Kitchener man used to smoke, the WSIB decided it couldn't determine how much of his cancer could be blamed on his job at the rubber plant. The review panel ultimately upheld that decision.  ""They said, 'There's no change.' I said all those people died doing the same work. Smokers and non-smokers,"" he said.  ""I said, 'I want you to tell me what they died from.' You know it's all work-related. I got angry."" Virginia MacKenzie, whose husband Ross MacKenzie died in 2007 at 70 after three rounds of cancer and chronic lung issues, said she's disappointed to see the WSIB standing firm with its original decisions. Her husband worked at BF Goodrich for 38 years, and MacKenzie has long believed his health problems were job-related.  ""Are they just doing the same thing again?"" she said. ""There has to be something we can do. They just don't seem to be getting the message.""  gmercer@therecord.com Twitter: @MercerRecord "

Three days after learning his Rubber Town series into a pattern of cancer and lung disease among rubber workers in the region was awarded a $45,000 Michener-Deacon Fellowship, Mercer's series earned the National Newspaper Awards prize for local reporting at a gala in Toronto on Friday night. His detailed probe into the serious health problems that afflicted workers from the region's once-booming rubber industry - and the apparent reluctance of workplace safety officials to accept their compensation claims - won out over other nominees from the Brandon Sun and St. Catharines Standard. ""Greg Mercer's work highlights the importance of local journalism,"" said Jim Poling, editor-in-chief of the Waterloo Region Record. ""His inquisitiveness and determination as a journalist has changed the lives of people in our community and given them voice when they didn't have any. Occupational health and disease is serious business and The Record will continue to investigate."" Mercer was also a finalist for the John Wesley Dafoe Award for Politics for exposing how the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party concocted a story that a legislator had sexually harassed a former party intern, in order to nominate a more well-connected party insider. Robert Fife, Steven Chase, Sean Silcoff and Christine Dobby from the Globe and Mail won the award for looking into how Huawei fits in with Beijing's global ambitions, and just how far Canada was willing to go to accommodate the technology juggernaut's quest for expansion. The Waterloo Region Record's John Roe was also a finalist for the Claude Ryan Award for Editorials. Fran�ois Cardinal of La Presse won the award.  The Globe and Mail took top honours overall, winning 10 of 21 categories. The Globe had 20 finalists spread over 13 categories, including all three finalists in the business category. There were 63 finalists in 21 categories, selected from 951 entries for work published in 2018. The competition is open to daily newspapers, news agencies and online news sites approved by the NNA board of governors. This was the 70th year of the awards, which were established by the Toronto Press Club in 1949 to encourage excellence and reward achievement in daily newspaper work in Canada. The awards program has operated under its current administrative structure since 1989. Mercer will continue his work on the Rubber Town series after earning the fellowship from the Michener Awards Foundation. Each fellowship is worth $40,000 to pursue investigative work with a focus on the public good, and an additional $5,000 to cover expenses. Mercer will investigate work-related disease in Canada, exploring why it is under-reported and rarely compensated. Mercer first began his investigation into Waterloo Region's rubber industry last fall. Since then, he has written nearly two-dozen stories on the issue. The fellowships will be presented during the Michener Awards ceremony at Rideau Hall on June 14. All finalist entries for the NNA's can be viewed online at nna-ccj.ca."

So they gave it their best guess — deciding the rubber worker had an extremely rare condition known as Moyamoya Disease, a disorder never before seen in Canada and normally only afflicting children. Because of that best-guess diagnosis, a compensation claim by MacLean's widow was denied by Ontario's Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) this week. ""They told me they're turning the claim down because they can't find anything on the disease,"" said Jill James. ""They said the only way you could prove anything was if you exhume the body."" MacLean, who died in 1999 at the age of 54, spent the last eight years of his life in nearly vegetative state. Doctors told his family his condition was incurable, caused by a disorder that reduces blood flow to the brain and leads to strokes. ""That diagnosis never made sense to me. I think it was mislabelled,"" said James, who submitted a WSIB claim for occupational disease on MacLean's behalf in January. The WSIB, meanwhile, says a medical diagnosis is one of the biggest factors in board decisions on claims. It says the board relies ""on the best science and medical information available, in addition to other relevant factors."" ""We have to rely on the medical information that we have,"" explained Christine Arnott, spokesperson for the WSIB.  ""For a work-related illness claim to be allowed, there must be conclusive scientific evidence linking a person's disease or diagnosis to workplace exposures."" James has the right to appeal, it added. MacLean worked at BF Goodrich and Epton Industries for almost 30 years, starting at age 17. James believes he paid for that job with his life.  When he died, doctors didn't make any link to his work, and no testing for occupational exposure was performed.  James says he was exposed to chemicals that made him sick — focusing her concern on benzene, a colourless chemical used to make rubber, plastic, dyes, detergents, drugs and pesticides.  Benzene, a known carcinogen used at the Kitchener plant, evaporates quickly in the air and is commonly absorbed into the body through inhalation. It's linked to leukemia, blood disorders and immune system problems.  Some medical studies have also found links between chronic benzene poisoning and neurological abnormalities — which is why it's caught James' attention. ""They used to put their hands right in that stuff. They never showered it off,"" she said. ""If there weren't all these people dropping dead and full of cancer, I would have dropped it. That's why I find it hard to believe he's the only one in Canada with this disease."" James said she'll ask the coroner for an autopsy if that could prove workplace exposure played a role in MacLean's death. There is some precedence for such an examination in suspected occupational disease cases in Ontario. Janice Martell, a workers' advocate who has spent years gathering evidence on McIntyre Powder poisoning among northern Ontario miners, used a provision of the Coroner's Act to get an autopsy performed on her father without cost.  She thinks other families should also be allowed to request autopsies when they believe someone's death is a result of workplace exposure. ""They should be doing it, in my mind, for all of them,"" Martell said. ""If it's costing the province of Ontario a bunch of money because the WSIB keeps rejecting all these claims, then they may begin to think about the larger cost to the system."" James says she'll do whatever it takes to get an answer. The official explanations for her late husband's disorder and death have never made sense to her. ""I've gone this far, I'm not going to quit now,"" she said. ""Something needs to be done to prove that these chemicals are doing things to people.""  gmercer@therecord.com Twitter: @MercerRecord"

Kitchener's Dan McAvoy, 69, found out this week his claim for a severe, debilitating and work-related rash that dates back to the early 1980s was reopened and approved by the WSIB.  McAvoy was an electrician at BF Goodrich in 1982 when he broke out in a rash during maintenance on mixing equipment fed by the plant's big Banbury machine.  He filed a claim with the WSIB, citing a doctor's diagnosis that he had an allergic reaction to resins and adhesives used in the rubber-making process, but his claim was denied. His rash was dismissed as simple psoriasis, a common skin condition, and he learned to live with itchy, painful outbreaks for years. After a Record investigation into the rubber industry's toxic legacy, the WSIB announced in December it would take a second look at more than 300 previously unapproved claims from local rubber workers.  McAvoy, who still wages a daily battle against the rash that covers about 80 per cent of his body, is among the first claimants to have a  denial overturned as part of that process.  ""I suspected for a long time this was work-related,"" he said. ""I'm glad they've finally acknowledged it. I knew there was more going on here than just psoriasis, but what could I do about it? They denied it for so long, so I just kept on working."" The WSIB's letter to McAvoy said it investigated Ministry of Labour records from the 1970s and found evidence the Goodrich Drive plant used rosin, a compound made from pine trees (also known as colophony), as a raw material in tire building. As a result of that discovery, the WSIB approved McAvoy's old claim on the basis of ""severe contact dermatitis."" He's waiting to find out how much he's entitled to for what the WSIB deems a ""non-economic loss"" that caused a permanent impairment. The WSIB traced his outbreak to Jan. 2, 1983, after McAvoy spent about a week over Christmas on a maintenance project that left workers covered head-to-toe in old rubber dust.  ""We were in this stuff, working away, all covered in black. The only way you could see who somebody is was to tell them to smile and see the whites of their teeth,"" he said.  McAvoy said he's lucky compared to co-workers who developed cancer or other life-threatening diseases that they believe were work-related. He worked at BF Goodrich until the plant closed in 2006, and put in 30 years with the company. Now he's hoping his is just the first of many more old claims where the WSIB admits it got it wrong. There are too many former rubber workers with too many troubling health issues for them all to be dismissed as unrelated, he said. ""I don't want to be a poster-child for the WSIB. Part of me worries they're just trying to be seen as taking some action,"" he said. ""It's easy to say no to one or two people, but it's much harder to say no to a crowd. Now all of a sudden, the crowd is coming out of the woodwork."" gmercer@therecord.com Twitter: @MercerRecord"

Jim Brophy said while the decision to reverse 31 of approximately 300 previously denied claims following the WSIB review is a ""good first step,"" a royal commission is needed to address occupational health risks and the compensation system across Canada. Brophy is a University of Windsor adjunct professor who has studied occupational disease for more than 30 years. ""The rubber worker stories really cry out for an open, public inquiry into what is happening in terms of occupational disease and the lack of recognition by the compensation system,"" Brophy said in an interview Tuesday. ""I don't think that 31 out of 300 is anything close to what needs to be done."" A royal commission consists of a panel of experts appointed by cabinet to conduct a full investigation into specific problem at the national scale. When an investigation is complete, the findings are reported to cabinet and the prime minister for appropriate action. Former rubber worker Chris Haufe, who spent 25 years working for Dominion Tire, Uniroyal and BF Goodrich in Kitchener, and another six years as president of the United Rubber Workers Local 80, called the decision to reverse just 10 per cent of the cases a ""tragedy"" for workers and their families. ""They're brushing us under the carpet again,"" he said. People who worked in the local rubber industry suspected for years the chemicals used in their job were making them sick. In some cases, workers or their surviving families fought the claims and appeal process for more than a decade, only to have their claims denied. Haufe, who turns 91 in just a few days, retired 30 years ago and had surgery for colon cancer about five years ago. He submitted a claim to the WSIB, but doesn't know if it's one of the 31 that were approved. He said he's waiting to receive a letter from the agency. ""After I retired, life was not much fun anymore,"" he said of his health struggles in recent years. ""When you came out of there, if you only had back pain you were lucky."" The WSIB review was ordered last December by board chair Elizabeth Witmer, who was concerned by stories of a cluster of cancer and lung disease among workers exposed to carcinogens in Kitchener's rubber manufacturing industry. The WSIB announced Monday it had concluded its review and that 31 previously denied claims will now be accepted due in part to new evidence and updated scientific research, while another 24 claims are currently under appeal. That means the vast majority of claims reviewed by the WSIB over the past 10 months (253) will remain denied. An additional 174 claims have been filed since the review was launched, and they are now being adjudicated through the regular claims process. Witmer said she can understand the frustration that some workers or their families feel, especially those who didn't have their denial reversed, but she's confident the panel of experts reviewed each case individually and gave them the attention they deserved. ""They did the best job they possibly could,"" she said. She also noted the province is reviewing occupational cancer in Ontario. It's being led by Dr. Paul Demers, director of the Occupational Cancer Research Centre at Cancer Care Ontario. Demers wasn't available for comment Tuesday. Of the 404 WSIB claims filed between 2002 and 2017 by former employees of some of Kitchener's largest rubber companies, only 15 per cent were accepted. The claims were for a variety of illnesses, including various types of cancer. The WSIB did not release any information related to the 31 claims that were accepted after the review, or the compensation that will be handed out. Brophy said no matter what the number is, it'll never be enough. ""There's no trade or no amount of money that brings back your loved ones. So much of the damage has been done over the past decades - some people lost their homes, retirements were destroyed, families were left devastated,"" he said.  ""So whatever the financial remuneration is, it's not going to be anything what would even be seen as remotely fair."" jjackson@therecord.com Twitter: @JamesDEJ "
