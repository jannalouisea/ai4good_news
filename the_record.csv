After nearly four months living under strict COVID-19 protocols, Waterloo Region will now begin life under the “new normal” of Stage 3 on Friday.  The third and final phase of Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s COVID-19 economic action plan, branded as the “Recover” stage of the provincial framework, will see the province move toward a reopening of most businesses in the approved regions.  “Nearly all businesses and public spaces will be able to gradually reopen in Stage 3, with public health and workplace safety restrictions in place, while some high-risk venues and activities will remain closed until they can safely resume operations,” the provincial framework reads.  Physical distance requirements of two metres will remain in place, but new protocols allow for groups of 50 to gather inside and groups of 100 to gather outside.  Restaurants, gyms, bars, movie theatres — all will be given the opportunity to follow the new framework to reopen back to the public.  And for businesses that have been bleeding cash for months, the announcement comes just in time.  “We are so excited to finally be able to reopen our doors,” said Brittany McLean, co-owner of the fitness studio F45 Kitchener Sportsworld. “Like anything, there are some worries but we know that happens when moving through uncharted territory. We have some incredible systems in place to be able to provide a safe workout environment for our community, and right now that’s all that matters.” Their studio will utilize individual squares, socially distanced, with no two people sharing the same equipment at any time. Masks will not be required for anyone working out.  Minto Schneider, chief executive officer of Waterloo Regional Tourism Marketing Corporation, will host a panel discussion Thursday on best practices for restaurants in the region.  Nick Benninger of the Fat Sparrow Group, Alex Kastner of Cambridge Mill, Jody Palubiski of the Charcoal Group, as well as representatives from public health and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, will participate.  But as has become customary with government announcements in the time of COVID-19, Palubiski said they are still awaiting specific guidelines on how restaurants can resume service inside.  All of his restaurant locations in the region will be reopen on Friday. He said they are planning with the assumption they will be allowed to have more than 50 people if they properly space the tables, and will scale that plan down if the province states 50 is the maximum regardless of space.  “We definitely will open to whatever capacity is allowed, whether that’s 50 people or spaced appropriately,” he said. “We’re going to be prepared either way, but we’re anxiously awaiting the clarity.” In the eyes of longtime food critic and writer Andrew Coppolino, the question now turns to whether customers will show up. “There’s two different things at play here,” he said. “On the one hand, of course restaurants are going to be excited to reopen so they can pay the bills. But will customers use a month to watch and see what happens? We just don’t know how they are going to react.” Palubiski is hoping trends will continue.  Based on what he has seen with patio attendance, customers have been turning up in higher numbers week over week with the increased patio space.  “I’m optimistic,” he said. “We’ve been so gratified by the level of support we’ve received. I think people are going to want to go out and connect. I think people are going to want to feel normal again.”  More to come ..."

But the Kitchener man may have been truthful about one thing: He said he had advanced prostate cancer and was worried he would die in prison. McColl, 66, died on Sunday at Beaver Creek Institution in Gravenhurst “of apparent natural causes following an illness,” Correctional Service Canada said in a news release. “As in all cases involving the death of an inmate, Correctional Service Canada will review the circumstances.” McColl killed Kate Reid, 51, in her apartment on Burn Place, near the corner of Belmont Avenue West and Highland Road West, on Jan. 2, 2015. He was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced in 2017 to life in prison with no chance of parole for 13 years. McColl, who sublet a room in Reid’s apartment, struck her in the head with a hammer as many as 14 times and then concealed her body on her third-floor balcony, where it froze. He left her body there until late January, when he tossed it to the ground, dragged it near a dumpster and covered it with snow. Her body was not found until March 20, 2015. McColl continued living in the apartment for weeks after the killing. Reid, a former waitress who was on disability support, moved here years ago from New Brunswick. McColl, a former film producer and son of a United Church minister, maintained Reid came at him with a hunting knife in a dispute over rent. He said he struck her with the hammer in self-defence. The jury didn’t buy it. McColl admitted that after killing Reid, he impersonated her in a call to MasterCard to get a new PIN for her credit card. He used the card to buy two iPads and get money from an ATM. McColl also forged Reid’s signature on her cheques to pay bills to make it look like she was still alive and told Reid’s 17-year-old daughter her mom had gone to New Brunswick, even though Reid’s dead body was on the balcony. He then went about trying to cover up the crime, cutting up bloody parts of a couch and disposing of all of her belongings.  “Fifty-one years of memories, pictures and treasures thrown in the trash as garbage,” her sister, Leslie Reid, said at McColl’s sentencing hearing. “A small, red recipe book that Kate began when she was 13, filled with notes from her grandmother, is now lost forever because you wanted to erase a life. “For selfless reasons, you, Mr. McColl, not only killed my sister but you also murdered any chance of my family keeping a single physical reminder of Kate’s life in Ontario.”"

The woman was taken by ambulance to Hamilton General Hospital with serious injuries. The family dog was killed, said Sgt. Scott Griffiths of Waterloo Regional Police. The collision between the pedestrian and a garbage truck occurred at 8:45 a.m. in the area of Countryside Crescent and Tuerr Drive in Kitchener. Roads in the area will remain closed as Waterloo Regional Police continue to investigate.  Griffiths said officers are on scene and speaking to residents in the Country Hills neighbourhood who may have witnessed the crash between the pedestrian and the truck. Griffiths said officers will be canvassing the area. They are also looking for any video that neighbours may have captured of the crash. A commercial vehicle inspection will be conducted on the garbage truck, he said. Chaitram “Steve” Persaud, who lives on Tuerr Drive, said he was in the kitchen making coffee when he looked out his front window and saw someone lying on the ground along with a dog. “My neighbour was comforting the person,” said Persaud. Persaud said the woman struck is his neighbour across the street and “she is a very sweet lady.” He said he worries about drivers speeding on Tuerr Drive and motorists not fully stopping at the stop sign. Anyone with information on the crash is asked to call traffic services at 519-650-8500, ext. 8856. Emergency road signs are blocking off the area at Countryside Crescent and Tuerr Drive in the residential neighbourhood in the Country Hills area off Strasburg Road.  More to come. "

City council chose contractors Monday for portions of upgrades that will cost almost $10 million in total. The recreation complex on Parkside Drive is getting a skateboard park, basketball court, splash plaza, climbing structure, seating areas, and public art in the form of outdoor benches.  “I’m so excited,” Coun. Angela Vieth said. She figures it will turn the community centre, with its library and two ice pads, into more than a place for children who can afford to play hockey. The complex is part of a neighbourhood with lower incomes. “It’s getting closer to becoming what I would consider a community hub,” Vieth said. “It’s been a long time coming.”  The upgrade will go where visitors currently park in 33 spaces. Lost spaces will be replaced by new parking spaces elsewhere at the complex. Construction is to start this summer and largely finish by the fall.  At Silver Lake and Waterloo Park in the downtown, council intends to realign Laurel Creek, remove the aging Lion’s Lagoon water park, and dredge and reconfigure the lake. The park is getting new pathways, a new boardwalk, fountain features, and a beach area.  Work on Silver Lake is expected to start this month and conclude in six months, weather permitting. Work on Laurel Creek was approved in May. Other work on Waterloo Park is to be advertised this summer. It’s expected that the overall lake and park project will be completed by the fall of 2021.  Council also voted Monday to reduce more speed limits or install signs or traffic-calming measures as part of its bid to make streets friendlier to pedestrians and cyclists during the COVID-19 pandemic. Various changes will be made on Sundew Drive, in the Old Abbey Road neighbourhood, and Waterloo Street.  Speed limits past five schools will be reduced to 30 km/h within the Eastbridge and Westvale neighbourhoods. Council has reduced other streets in those neighbourhoods to 40 km/h. "

He was dropping his daughter off at her bus stop, and a neighbour had brought post cards raising concerns about water bottling permits to send to the Ontario Ministry of Environment. Today Case is the board chair for the Wellington Water Watchers and last week witnessed the ousting of Nestlé from the county. “Good for us that we raised enough of a stink to make it uncomfortable for Nestlé to do business here,” he says. “But let’s finish the job by pushing our government to start phasing out permits to take water for bottling completely,” Case says. “It’s great Nestlé is leaving, but it’s still the same problem.” The sale of the Nestlé infrastructure to Ice River Springs water bottling company is still under review by the Competition Bureau of Canada, the federal organization that reviews all company sales to protect competition in the marketplace. Case speculates that once Ice River Springs takes over Nestle’s Ontario plants and well, they’ll have a monopoly on water bottling in the province.  Ice River Springs, a private company, portrays itself as a family-owned business invested in sustainability and environment. The company says all their bottles are made from 100 per cent recycled plastic made at their Shelburne recycling plant and plans to do the same at the former Nestlé plants. They report they use 85 per cent of the PET recycled material in Ontario’s blue box program.  Sandy Gott, Ice River Springs’ executive VP and co-owner says the company has invested $30 million in plastics recycling, and takes in 65 million pounds of plastic per year. But Case doesn’t buy it. “It looks like a lot of greenwashing if you ask me,” he says. “Water doesn’t require plastic.” Though he admits, “It’s interesting that they’ve found ways to recycle plastic.”  The Grand River Source Water Protection Committee and Centre Wellington, a township next to the Middlebrook well, reported in May that private permits to take water do not have a major impact on municipal water levels, because they are usually too far from municipal wells. But Case feels this misses the point. “I approach it with a more precautionary, conservation lens,” he says. “The question of affecting water flows is only one part of the equation.” Case feels that regardless of the amount of water taken, people need to ask why the water is being taken, for whose benefit and at what cost. “Water is for life, not profit,” he says. The sale involves all of Nestle’s Purelife brand bottled water infrastructure including a factory in Puslinch, Ontario and Hope, BC, as well as the Middlebrook well in Erin, Ontario."

The woman announced to her estranged husband in late June that she and their five-year-old daughter were flying to San Antonio on July 6. The woman’s boyfriend lives in Texas. The girl resides primarily with her mother but spends alternate weekends with her father. Neither parent has sole decision-making powers over their child. The father opposed the U.S. trip and the case went to court. “The COVID-19 situation causes significant concern for father vis-à-vis the possibility of (the child) being exposed to the virus,” Superior Court Justice Jennifer Breithaupt Smith wrote in a ruling on July 2, four days before the proposed trip. The judge also noted that after returning to Canada, the child would have to self-isolate for two weeks. “This will result in further periods of missed parenting time between father and (the child),” the judge wrote, adding the girl will “effectively be denied parenting time with her father for the full month of July.” Breithaupt Smith said she would deny the Texas trip even without a pandemic. “This is in fact simply a case of inappropriate unilateral decision-making by one parent to the detriment of the other, and by extension of the child,” she said “COVID-19 adds a layer of desperation to the matter, but ... mother must receive the clear message that her actions would not be tolerated even if COVID-19 were not a factor.” The parents separated in 2018. The man had told his estranged wife he wanted to spend more time with their daughter. Text messages in late June had a “nasty” tone after the woman told him about the Texas trip, the judge said. Father: “You have put (our child) in a very bad situation because of your personal needs.” Mother: “Lol. Well since it’s a pandemic I guess she’ll have to isolate with me until it’s over. Thank you goodbye.” She went on to say: “We’ll be issuing a court order for permission to travel. You won’t have a say in this anymore.” The judge said the woman has previously travelled to the U.S. with her daughter without the father’s advance consent. When the trip took place was not specified. “International travel during a period of closed or uncertain border controls between a child’s habitual residence and the country being visited requires unequivocal agreement of both parents based upon a clear and collaborative plan,” Breithaupt Smith said. “It is not a decision that can be unilaterally made by one parent over the other’s objections, particularly where all parenting issues are the subject of active litigation.” Breithaupt Smith ruled neither parent can take the child out of Canada without the written consent of the other or a court order. The judge ordered the girl’s passport be deposited with the office of the father’s lawyer and said it “shall be retained there until it is released upon the written consent of the parties or further order of the court.”"

On July 9, pair of youths from Guelph and Kitchener — both 14 years old females — were at Turkey Point Beach, when they met a group of people they didn’t know from Brantford. They were invited back to a vehicle where they consumed drugs, Norfolk County OPP said. The teenagers returned to the beach but started feeling sick. A concerned passerby called 911 when they saw the pair vomiting and falling asleep. They were taken to hospital for treatment and have since been released. Media relations officer Const. Ed Sanchuk said it’s not known what substance these youth were given or who led them over to the vehicle. Police are asking anyone with information to contact the OPP at 1-888-310-1122, or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.

But her application was rejected three times by the Ontario government. Each time, a white businessperson was chosen instead. Hogarth is Black. She is a professor of social work whose research focuses on race and discrimination. For several years, she worked closely with Waterloo Regional Police Chief Bryan Larkin. “We talked about race, we talked a lot about discrimination, we talked about diversifying the police force,” said Hogarth, who teaches at Renison University College at the University of Waterloo. She had discussions with Larkin, too, after a 2016 investigation by the Record’s Jeff Outhit discovered that Black people were four times more likely to be stopped and questioned by police, without being accused of a crime, than white people were. So “I don’t know what makes me unsuitable” to join the police board, she said. It is painfully obvious that someone with Hogarth’s background would be ideal to help steer the changes that are needed for the police. Across North America, police are under a microscope as never before. Communities have erupted for six weeks over systemic racism against Black people. It started after the murder of an African-American man, George Floyd, by a white police officer in Minneapolis on May 25. But, as dreadful as it was, Floyd’s fate was only the last straw of a long, heavy, painful history of violence against Black people. Waterloo Region is part of this. The Black Lives Matter demonstration in downtown Kitchener on June 3 brought thousands of people together, demanding less funding for police and more for social agencies that could better help people who are in mental health crisis, who are homeless, poor or racialized. After that march, Regional Chair Karen Redman, who also chairs the police board, advocated for a Black person to be appointed to the remaining vacant position.  There are seven people on the police board. Three are elected regional councillors, all white. One is Rosita Tse, who is Waterloo Region’s appointment and the only non-white person. Three others are selected by the province. This year, the province appointed three white people to the board: Ian McLean, president of the Greater Kitchener Waterloo Chamber of Commerce. Tony Giovinazzo, chief executive officer of Activa. And most recently, Karin Schnarr, business professor at Wilfrid Laurier University. They have many skills and experiences. But none of them is an expert on racism. None of them could possibly understand what it is like to be followed more often, stopped more often, to be more fearful of violence from the armed keepers of public order — only because of your skin colour. Some Black activists have said there should not be a Black person on the police board, that this person would never be anything more than a token, forced to be part of a team that takes no significant action. Hogarth doesn’t agree. “If we are having a Black person on a police board as a token, then we don’t need to be there,” she said. “If, however, you are even remotely interested in change, then absolutely, get us there. “Your participation is severely limited if you are not represented.” The provincial Lieutenant Governor makes the selections for police board appointments. Hogarth never received a letter advising her that she had been rejected, or explaining why she had not been chosen. A full month after the Black Lives Matter demonstration in Kitchener, the province announced Schnarr’s appointment. There can only be two reasons for yet another white person to have been named to the police board. One is if there just weren’t any qualified Black candidates for the position. Thanks to Hogarth’s application, we know that isn’t true. That leaves the other explanation: That the selection process is itself part of a culture of systemic racism and white supremacy. Clearly, this process needs to change. Local residents — the people who are actually being policed — should be the ones to decide, through local elections, who is chosen to oversee the police service. Not the remote, unresponsive provincial government. "

An 81-year-old man on a three-wheeled electric scooter was charged with impaired driving. His driver’s licence was suspended for 90 days. He has a court date in November. Holy smokes! On July 5 police pulled over two vehicles on Highway 17 near Dryden, between Thunder Bay and Winnipeg, and seized $1.6 million worth of illegal cigarettes. OPP found 386 cases of smokes. A case holds 50 cartons and a carton has 200 cigarettes, so if our math is correct, that’s 3.8 million cigarettes. Three people from Winnipeg and one from Brampton, ranging in age from 27 to 40, were charged with trafficking in contraband tobacco. Human powder keg Three young adults in Meaford, 40 kilometres northwest of Collingwood, were attacked after they set off fireworks on the night of July 4. A man allegedly struck them in the shoulder area with a baseball bat and then used it to smash windows of multiple vehicles. Two of the victims were treated at hospital. The attack happened when the three men returned to a cottage after setting off fireworks at a nearby lake. A Meaford man, 72, was charged with assault with a weapon and mischief. Facing the music If you are breaking a condition of your release from court, blasting music from your car in front of the police station may be ill-advised. On June 30 at 6:30 p.m., an officer heard loud music and yelling from a car parked beside the OPP detachment in Clinton, 20 kilometres southeast of Goderich. Two people were in the car. Turns out a condition of their release from a previous alleged crime was to have no contact with each other. A London woman, 21, and a London youth were charged with failing to comply with a release condition. Driver flees with children in car A man faces 18 charges after he fled in his car at a RIDE checkpoint. On June 27 at 2 a.m., a car with two adults and four children, all under 12, was stopped on Highway 11 in Kapuskasing, 170 kilometres northwest of Timmins. The driver took off in the car, almost hitting officers. Police located the car but it was empty. All six were later found in a trailer. The driver, 31, of Arran-Elderslie, Ont., faces a slew of charges, including fleeing police, dangerous driving and driving while a child passenger is not properly secured. The other adult, 25, of Tara, Ont., faces seven charges, including making a false statement and obstructing police. Family and Children’s Services was notified.  Beer in cup holder, kids in back seat On July 1 at 1:15 p.m., a citizen told Caledon OPP a car on Highway 10 was crossing into oncoming lanes. Police clocked the driver at 127 km/h in an 80 zone. “As the officer approached the vehicle, he observed an open beer bottle in a cup holder between the front seats,” police said. “Two small children, age one and three, were seated in the back with an adult passenger.” An Edmonton man, 31, was charged with impaired driving, speeding and driving with an open container of alcohol. “Peel Children’s Aid was notified to follow up on the incident,” OPP said. Not jumping for joy OPP injected a pun into the report of a June 28 theft in Exeter, 25 kilometres east of Grand Bend. A trampoline mat and all the springs were stolen. “The property owners woke up the next morning to find the frame sitting in the backyard and nothing more,” police said. “Seems like a lot of work for a relatively low payoff, but these thieves jumped at the chance to get themselves a used trampoline mat. Huron OPP is hopeful to receive some tips from the public to help solve this rather unusual theft.” Give me your car or I’ll ...

As society sticks its toe back into the proverbial wading pool — and literally in the real ones — four months into the COVID lockdown, Waterloo Region’s new masking bylaws mandate that, like Hannibal Lecter and The Green Hornet, everyone must cover their face in indoor public settings. When it kicks in Monday there will, of course, be exemptions for age, health, disabilities. But it’s an unexpected pivot that — while crucial in controlling the virus’s spread — has all sorts of cultural implications. On this week’s panel, four of the region’s deep thinkers contemplate a world undercover, where bank robbers, citizens and Jason from “Friday the 13th” blend indiscriminately, with the alluring prospect of a Victorian-styled resurgence in personal modesty: “I can’t show my face — I might cough.” On hand to sort through this psychological morass: radio personalities Angie Hill and Mike Farwell, pop culture priestess Isabel Kuxdorf and University of Waterloo history prof Andrew Hunt.  As someone who believes everything I read on Twitter, I want to cut to the chase: is this a government conspiracy to erode our freedoms and destroy democracy?  Farwell: If it is, governments really need to aim higher than “put this piece of cloth on your face!” Hunt: I saw a video a few days ago about a U.S. woman yelling that face masks were a “Deep State” plot to take away our freedoms. I thought “If this is what totalitarianism 2020-style looks like, we’re gonna have a pretty easy ride compared to people who lived under dictatorships in the last century.” Kuxdorf: Folks, the mask will not erode your freedom. Leave that to the Tech giants and Lobbyists. I sense skepticism, but in Toronto last week, subway protesters chanted “hugs over mask, we don’t have to ask!” Freedom fighting aside, how much do you want an unsolicited hug from a stranger with COVID? Farwell: If I’m going down from COVID, I’m going down hugging. Hunt: I think I’ll take a Pasadena on the Free Hugs Movement. I wasn’t into it pre-COVID. If that makes me Mr. Square, so be it. Hill: Never … Ever … get off me! Jump back six months. You walk into a bank and see someone wearing a mask. What’s your reaction? Hill: Call the cops ... potential robbery Hunt: “I demand fifteen thousand dollars and a 707 to Havana! No, make that twenty thousand!” Is it permissible to yell at someone if you see their nose peeking over the top of their mask? Hunt: No way! It gives them a sort of nonconformist street cred.  Given the exemptions for medical conditions, kids under five, no proof required, why would anyone wear a mask? Farwell: Because they want to feel a part of our pandemic recovery and because, believe it or not, they actually care about other people. Hill: Better safe than sorry — kind of like that kid who doesn’t believe in Santa Claus and gets nothing … you wanna take THAT chance???? You radio people are so rule-abiding. Hunt: This might be like the big controversy over mandatory seatbelt laws back in the ’80s. It calmed down after people realized that if you don’t wear one, you go flying through the windshield face-first into a utility pole. Isabel, you see other benefits?  Kuxdorf: Free facial. Your constant breathing creates a steam bath for your face. Gross but truly pore-opening! Tell me more. Kuxdorf: Think of the money we’ll save on lip plumpers, glosses and facial waxing. We can use masks to hide imperfections, as in the Victorian fan, which among other uses, was used to hide bad teeth. For wheezing gasbags like myself, breathing difficulties kick in after 10 minutes. What impact will this have on shopping? Farwell: Ten minutes? That’s Ironman territory. If there’s any impact on shopping, my guess is it’s on those who won’t enter a store if they don’t see people inside wearing masks. Shoppers gonna shop. Hunt: I overheat. As a result, I get disoriented when I’m shopping. I end up buying things I wouldn’t ordinarily buy, like tiny cocktail parasols and exotic dragon fruits and People magazine. Hill: It’ll make people less likely to browse and more pick it up and run.  Should Halloween masks be considered appropriate protection under the new bylaw? If so, who would you be? Hill: The old man from The Muppets ... and I’d demand the senior discount.  Hunt: I’d dig one of those big dome helmets from “Alien,” complete with a built-in face hugger. Kuxdorf: I find it ironic that Halloween masks were banned in schools but now they’re going to be REQUIRED. You can now officially run around like an upside down Zorro — any day of the year. What about incorporating space helmets? I’m thinking Matt Damon in “The Martian.”  Farwell: Oddly enough, I’m thinking of The Great Gazoo. Is that a “Flintstones” reference? You gotta move into the 21st century, man. I say that as someone who patterned his life after Potsie in “Happy Days.” Kuxdorf: Our governments could generate much needed revenue by selling masks with provincial or state mottos. Wouldn’t you like to run around with Ontario’s new “Open for Business” on your face?  Bylaw enforcement will be complaint driven. I have a neighbour who calls the snitch line if our tree branch hangs an inch too low. Would this be a good opportunity to exact revenge?  Farwell: We’ll bitch about it on Facebook, but actually taking the time to call someone official? You have to remember people are generally really, really good. It’s just that those who are less good make a lot of noise. Hunt: Any means of exacting petty revenge, I’m all for. Is there a danger of getting so comfortable wearing a mask you may not want to take it off? Farwell: Is it September 30th yet? Because as much as I’m willing to do my part, I don’t love wearing a mask. I’m looking forward to our bylaw’s sunset clause and release from the shackles of facial fabric. Hunt: My son made me a mask when the pandemic first hit in March. Not only is it comfy, I have a strong sentimental attachment. Ah, those poignant pandemic moments! At what point do you say “To hell with nose hair/blemishes/washing my face?” Farwell: I’m pretty sure for me that point was 1989. When you look at People magazine and see photos of celebrities strolling along exotic beaches wearing masks, does this justify its $5.99 cover price? Kuxdorf: If this spells the end to the “Instagram pucker” popularized by Kim Kardashian, now seen in school yearbook photos everywhere, then I’m all for it. Can we make mask wearing a requirement on social media? Hunt: The celebrity in question has to be pretty damn cool to sway me. Hardcore cool — the level of Abdul ‘Duke’ Fakir, the last surviving member of The Four Tops. Or Fox Mulder and Dana Scully cool. Or legendary Mad magazine artist Al Jaffee, who recently retired at age 99. You history profs and your pop culture Easter eggs. Wikipedia! Hunt: If you see a guy in the grocery store wearing an Immortan Joe mask from “Mad Max: Fury Road,” don’t be scared. He’s just there for Ruffles and Diet Coke."

The test was originally scheduled for August, but when Rendle received a call from the hospital a few weeks ago, she was optimistic there had been some cancellations and she would get in sooner. Instead, she was told that her test is currently deemed non-essential and the date had been cancelled indefinitely, due to the backlog caused by restrictions in place for the COVID-19 pandemic. “I can’t tell you how many nights I’ve been awake with pain and got down on my knees and just said ‘Please, I just need an answer.’ Then I have this MRI two months away and my hopes are crushed and there’s no hope in sight,” Rendle said. “I’m just desperate. This has really interfered with my quality of life.” On May 26, Ontario said hospitals could resume elective and non-essential surgeries and clinical activities put on hold in March, providing the hospitals met certain criteria. This included appropriate staffing levels, sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) and maintaining an adequate hospital occupancy level. While Cambridge Memorial Hospital is making a gradual return to resuming these services, Sandra Hett, vice-president of clinical programs and chief nursing executive, said it’s “not business as usual yet.” That will likely be the case across Ontario for what could be longer than a year, Dr. Samantha Hill, president of the Ontario Medical Association said. Hospitals can’t get to the levels they were at before COVID because they still need to maintain precautions, Hill said. “That means spacing patients farther apart, that means a deeper clean between patients, it means everything takes longer to be done safely,” she said. “So you started with a system that already had wait lists, hallway medicine, et cetera, and it keeps getting worse.” In May, hospitals were to submit a plan to public health prior to resuming elective services, including a plan to book patients based on a prioritization scale. Hett said this scale is determined by Cancer Care Ontario Grand River and St. Mary’s hospitals confirm they are also undergoing similar processes. Lee Fairclough, president of St. Mary’s and Waterloo Wellington hospital lead for the pandemic response, said triaging and rescheduling will occur over many months and will be based on bed capacity. “This process has always existed, and there are times when procedures and surgeries unfortunately need to be postponed to accommodate more urgent and emergent cases,” she said.  “Under the new reality of COVID-19, some bed capacity must be maintained in case there is a surge in COVID cases, and hospitals must also have sufficient personal protective and other equipment, medications and human resources,” Fairclough said. In an email to the Cambridge Times, Ontario Health said it recognizes this is a difficult and distressing time, especially for patients waiting to receive the services they require; however, addressing the backlog will require different timing from hospital to hospital. Hill said that the best course of action at this point would be to get the Ministry of Health, government officials and representatives from the Ontario Medical Association to come together to work through the current problem. “It’s a real crisis. It’s not something that there is an easy answer for,” she said. “There are mitigating options that we can apply, but we need to figure it out together.” With files from Perth Courier."

The latest comet to blaze across the night sky will be visible just after 10 p.m. each night for the next little while.  “I could see this one in the city, which makes it special,” said Ellen Papenburg, a local amateur astronomer and member of the Kitchener-Waterloo Astronomy Club.  NEOWISE isn’t as bright as some of the comets Papenburg has seen in 50 years of skygazing, but it is still a pleasant surprise after two promising comets, Atlas and Swan, disintegrated before they got close enough to the earth to see. “Comets are quite fickle,” Papenburg said. “I compare comets with cats. They do what they want and they have tails.” That is why it is such a delight to be able to spot one so easily. Papenburg was able to see NEOWISE from her downtown Kitchener home with a pair of binoculars, and then again with a friend early one morning. It has been seven years since she has seen a comet with the naked eye.  Last week, Papenburg woke up at 3 a.m. to go out and find NEOWISE with a friend. The comet was only visible in the early hours of the morning then.  “It was worth it,” she said. “I’m not a morning person so I’m glad it will be visible in the evening now.”  Papenburg has spent most of her life chasing these celestial objects.  “They are like dirty snowballs. They are made of rock and ice and frozen gases,” she said.  She has seen between 15 and 20 comets in her lifetime. Her love for these fickle balls of rock and ice began with her first comet sighting at 16 years old. It was 1970 and she was living in Holland when she watched Comet Bennett brighten in the night sky.  She was hooked after that. Her favourite one was Comet West in 1976.  “That one was so big,” she said. “It had such a long tail it took up almost one-sixth of the sky.”  “I’m still waiting on another one like that.” NEOWISE is about the width of a fist above the northwest horizon, just below the Big Dipper. It will be climbing upward in the coming weeks which also means it will become dimmer in the sky — catch a glimpse before it’s too late.  It was discovered by the Near-Earth Object Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) space telescope on March 27.

They urge everyone in Waterloo Region to watch out for each other to prevent a rise in family violence during this unprecedented and stressful time. “There is so much that can be done just by reaching out to people,” said Karen Spencer, executive director of Family & Children’s Services of the Waterloo Region. Several agencies have joined together to launch the Keep Families Safe campaign to raise awareness about the danger of violence against women and children due to the isolation and stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  “This is still a dangerous time for women and for families,” said Jennifer Hutton, chief executive officer of Women’s Crisis Services of Waterloo Region. Reaching out for help may not be safe for many in abusive homes, and pandemic restrictions mean people are out less in the community where others can spot warning signs. Usually the shelters are full or close to full, but at the pandemic’s start that dropped to about half and calls were also down. Since the region moved into Stage 2 of the reopening plan and added opportunities to leave the home make reaching out easier, more women are seeking safe refuge.  “There is some relief that we’re seeing more,” Hutton said. “We’re still not at what would be typical for us.” That worries her because the current situation points to an escalation of family violence, not a decrease.  The agency added an online chat feature to its website as a discrete way for women to reach out for help. Hutton said it’s seeing good use, with one family reporting they could come into shelter because that option was available.  Normally, Hutton said it is difficult for women to leave an abusive situation but the pandemic has added other barriers to overcome, including uncertainty for the future.  “So then it’s hard to make such a major decision about taking your kids and going into a shelter,” she said. At Family & Children’s Services, calls were down at the start of the pandemic while police were responding to more. But now referrals are back to normal levels and that’s lessened the fear about unreported family violence. “There isn’t that same worry that people aren’t calling us to report concerns about a child’s safety or to request help,” Spencer said.  The agency relies on the community for early intervention because they’re called when something happens to a child or there’s a serious concern about well-being. Spencer is thankful people are looking out for their neighbours, and families are being connected to available support from food hampers to counselling. “I would say the community has really pulled together to make sure families don’t fall through the cracks and get the help they need,” Spencer said. “That’s been a collective community effort.” She hopes that continues, emphasizing that a listening ear or helping hand go a long way to ensure families have what they need to survive this stressful time. There’s a link between a lack of support networks and child welfare concerns, Spencer said. “A lot can be done to prevent child abuse and neglect by simply reaching out.”"
18,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/news/waterloo-region/2020/07/13/neighbours-oppose-housing-proposal-in-beechwood-neighbourhood.html,Neighbours oppose housing proposal in Beechwood neighbourhood,['Bill Jackson'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","WATERLOO — Ray Pearce has lived in Beechwood for more than 30 years and said no one living in the single-family homes across from 555 Beechwood Dr. ever thought the property would be used for an apartment building. The sloped parcel of green space was used for a pumping station until 2016 and has served as passive park space for as long as Pearce can recall. The region recently announced plans to declare the property surplus and issue a request for proposals, requiring future owner(s) to create affordable housing in a building of up to six storeys under current zoning on the land. “They are talking about many, many units — 250 bedrooms,” Pearce said. His wife Lyn noted there are plans for a 12-storey apartment building at 508 Beechwood Dr. and more affordable housing is also proposed as part of an existing housing co-op at 693 Beechwod Dr. “In a short period of time you could be looking at 1,000 more people on this tiny little road,” she said. According to the region’s manager of housing programs and development, Jennifer Murdoch-Martin, the city rezoned the property in 2005 to medium density as part of its nodes and corridors study to permit future residential intensification. Michelle Lee, senior policy planner with the city, said Erb Street West was identified as a minor corridor and various properties on the periphery of established neighbourhoods, and adjacent to public transportation, were identified for intensification. Lee said it was a five-year study involving mail-outs to neighbourhood associations, more than 10 open houses and significant public input, but acknowledged that making residents aware of high-level policy decisions can be challenging. Residents of Beechwood said they were never made aware. The Pearces spread the word after receiving a pamphlet about the project advertising two town halls. “Hello Neighbours!” the pamphlet read. “It takes a community to create homes for all; and while nearly 5,000 individuals and families anxiously wait for affordable housing, your community has an opportunity to make an impact.” Dozens of people attended the two Zoom meetings and the majority are against the proposal, residents contend. According to those who took part in the virtual town hall meetings, they got quite animated, with some accused of being bigots after speaking out in opposition. “(One person) was saying, ‘You’re just against low-income housing,’ and people got really offended and mad, because that’s not the focus of this,” Lyn said.  “It feels like they’re doing this in a bubble — that they’re really not paying attention to the neighbourhood around them,” Lyn said. The decision to declare the land surplus is expected to be made at regional council on July 15. The RFP would be issued later in the month, with the selected proposal coming back to council in September. Regional Coun. Jim Erb, chair of the region’s housing and homelessness steering committee, said the design still needs to be determined and public engagement is ongoing. Erb believes residents have valid concerns relating to building height and traffic, but many residents, including the Westminister United Church next door, support the project, he said. “The zoning permits six storeys; that’s not to say that will be the actual height.” Parkland is to be incorporated. Erb noted the new units in Waterloo would not be classified as supportive housing, but the region — with more than 5,000 people on a waiting list — sees the property as an opportunity to move the needle on affordable housing,"

The boys would light warming fires at the pond’s edge and illuminate the surface by lantern so they could skate themselves into exhaustion. For Irene Bitschy, these were special childhood memories of the 1910s, memories that would only become more colourful as she grew up. Born Irene Harnack on Oct. 18, 1914, on a Shantz Station farm, she was the middle kid in a family of nine. Irene was born months after the outbreak of the First World War and in her 10 decades, she would live through many world events including the Spanish Flu epidemic and Prohibition. Her life became really interesting and a little subversive during the latter. At age 14, Irene took a job at her aunt’s hotel in downtown Kitchener. Thanks to overzealous temperance workers, Prohibition was in full force by 1916, banning the serving of alcohol in public places. So it simply went underground, or in the case of the Kitchener hotel, it went up into a laundry basket. Irene’s main job at the hotel was to wash and iron linens in a second-floor room but she had another, equally important role. The hotel posted a guard at the street entrance and when he spotted police heading toward the hotel for a raid, a chain of events began: the men inside gathered up the liquor and knocked on the ceiling. A trap door would suddenly open, Irene would drop her laundry basket down the hole for the men to place the offending liquor in, then she’d haul it up, close the door and hide the bottles under sheets. Irene admitted that this was the scariest time of her life, always living on the edge, always facing the possibility of arrest. Life on the farm was also somewhat risky. Her father, Joseph Harnack, ran a still on the farm and he was lucky to have a pal on the police force who alerted him to planned raids which would have ruined his bootleg operation. Irene had remembered that times were desperate, her father had many mouths to feed and limited options. There were happy times as well on the farm. Picnics and garden parties were frequent, and it was at one of these events at the Harnack home that Irene met William Bitschy, from Maryhill. William was quite smitten by the pretty Irene, but she wasn’t exactly feeling the same. Uncomfortable with his attentions, Irene left the party and hid in her room. William had to take a different tack. He danced with her grandmother and convinced her to intervene on his behalf. It must have worked because Irene agreed to go out with him and the two married in Kitchener in April 1935. Bill’s priest in Maryhill had refused to marry the couple, given Irene was not a parishioner, so they married in Kitchener. With the Depression in full swing, the newlywed’s wedding brunch was surprisingly generous, serving a rare treat of hotdogs. The young couple honeymooned in Niagara Falls and would go on to have four daughters: Charlotte, Sheila, Marlene and Lynda. In the early part of their marriage, the couple lived at a gas station. Irene served ice cream and pumped gas while Bill delivered coal. They later moved to Breslau where they lived for five years before purchasing a farm. Irene was back to farm life, working alongside her husband. In 1953, Bill landed a job with CN Railway and four years later, the couple moved to Kitchener. With four daughters to raise, Irene was a stay-at-home mom until she learned about a new residence opening at the University of Waterloo. They were looking for a “house mom” to help students, many who were on their own for the first time. Several were foreign students and these kids were often invited for dinner with Irene and Bill, easing their homesickness. Irene retired in 1975 and in 1988, Bill died. Always stoic, Irene sold the family home and moved to an apartment. In 1990, at 76, Irene boarded her first airplane, for an Alaskan adventure. Lynda Tranebo said her mother was kind and loving. “She would do anything for anybody.” Irene was also an exceptional cook, particularly potato salad and popcorn balls that she made every Halloween for dozens of neighbourhood kids. In May, Irene was diagnosed with COVID-19 and made local headlines when the nursing home moved her to hospital for more intensive care. Though she didn’t exhibit symptoms, the illness did weaken her organs. Irene died May 22, 2020, at 105."

Manager Josh Williamson said graffiti on the Kitchener store’s wall facing King Street is a common occurrence, with the latest spray-painted message appearing on Canada Day. That got him thinking that maybe the graffiti could be covered with a mural for everyone passing by to enjoy. “It’s always been in the back of my mind,” Williamson said. “I think we can really make this a good project for the community going forward.” He wants to partner with artists to create removable murals that will be auctioned off for charity once a year. The unique art would fill the four sections at the front of the building, now blank canvasses that attract graffiti.  Williamson put his idea out on Twitter and the response was overwhelming as artists expressed interest and others made recommendations. One spot is already reserved for art students from nearby Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate. He’s talking with local companies to create lighted enclosures to protect the art, and other companies have contacted him asking how they can help. The details aren’t all nailed down yet, and Williamson welcomes suggestions with the aim of having a September unveiling for the first creations.  “I think it could be ongoing to hopefully get that positive message yearly,” he said. “I’m just really excited for the potential.”"

Kitchener Mayor Berry Vrbanovic, who introduced the motion at regional council calling for mandatory face coverings, said wearing a mask is the “ultimate sign of caring for your neighbour.” “We have a long history of both being a resilient community, but more importantly being a very caring and compassionate community,” Vrbanovic said. “I hope people will put that hat on, along with their mask.” He said the bylaws will make sure the region can continue to move forward, and people can get back as much a sense of normalcy as possible in their lives. Some view the bylaws as infringing on their rights, but Vrbanovic pointed out the flip side of that argument.  “With rights also comes our collective responsibility toward each other and our community,” he said. “Your decision to wear a mask will actually help to save lives … Together let’s look out for our community.” Coun. Tom Galloway, who supported mandatory masks from the start, thinks most people will follow the new requirement.  “There are going to be people who might cheat, feign an exemption, but that will be a small number of people,” Galloway said. He said the bylaws are imperfect, but they will help keep the curve flat to avoid closing things again and move to the next stage of reopening as soon as possible. The Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Health Unit made face coverings mandatory inside any commercial or retail establishment in mid-June, when both that area and Waterloo Region moved into Stage 2. Galloway said Guelph has about a 90 per cent compliance rate — and that’s a good goal for here. “That’s going to go a long way,” Galloway said. People are asking why now when local numbers are low, and not months ago. “We are doing well and we want to keep it that way,” Galloway said.  He is concerned that people who are exempt will stay home to avoid confrontations with others who may be bothered they’re not wearing one, but he stressed that some have legitimate reasons.  “There’s no need for individuals to self-enforce this,” he said. “People generally are law abiding.” People who are unable to wear a mask due to a medical condition or disability and children under five are exempt from wearing a face covering, defined as a medical or non-medical mask or other face covering, including a bandana, scarf or other fabric that covers the nose, mouth and chin. Regional Chair Karen Redman stressed that the bylaw does not require someone to show proof of exemption, and many health issues and disabilities are invisible.  “If you see someone not wearing a mask, assume they have a medical reason,” she said. Regional council voted unanimously last Monday night to pass two bylaws requiring face coverings on transit and in indoor public settings. Delegations took 3.5 hours at the start of the special council meeting, arguing both for and against a mask rule. “There’s strong views on all sides,” said chief administrative officer Mike Murray at Friday’s briefing. He said bylaws passed by council was a more democratic route that allowed public input, compared to “just issuing and edict.” “That’s a pretty robust process and it provides an opportunity for the community to weigh in, and it provides an opportunity for our elected officials to make an appropriate policy decision,” Murray said. “I’m hopeful that because of that public process that the community will be supportive of the direction that the regional council has taken.” The bylaws are in effect until Sept. 30, unless extended by council. They will be enforced by complaints.  Signs must be posted at entrances to all public spaces where masks are required. In the Guelph area, businesses were required to enforce the rule or face a hefty fine.  Acting medical officer of health Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang appreciates the bylaws here make it clear everyone is responsible for reducing the spread of COVID-19. “I was really pleased to see the bylaws that are passed does put the responsibility on all of us who can wear masks to wear masks, reinforcing what we’ve been trying to say all along which is that it’s a collective responsibility for us to protect each other,” Wang said. Redman said the region needs to find “the new normal,” and council believes wearing a mask is part of that.  “This is an important step in helping our region safely reopen and move from Stage 2 to Stage 3 in the near future,” Redman said. “When we keep our germs from others by wearing a mask, we help reduce the virus from spreading. It’s a simple and inexpensive action that we can take to take care of each other.” Find out more about the bylaws at regionofwaterloo.ca/en/face-covering-by-law.aspx."

Vuorinen, the conductor of the Grand Philharmonic Choir in Kitchener, artistic director of the Elora Festival and conductor of the Elora Festival Singers, wants health officials and governments to make evidence-based decisions about how and when choirs can resume practising, and perhaps performing live shows streamed to online audiences from empty halls. And to begin with, the focus should be on professional choirs, a tiny minority among the 3.5 million choir singers across the country, said Vuorinen. The COVID-19 pandemic silenced all of them in March.  The internationally renowned Elora Festival normally runs for three weeks in July, but it was cancelled. An online version is scheduled for early August. Professional choir singers rehearse or perform daily during the three-week long festival, and they earn a significant part of their annual income from it. So, Choirs Ontario and Vuorinen want public health officials and governments to start thinking about how to get professional choirs safely back to work. “As the other parts of our society, our economy open up we just want to signal our desire to have a conversation,” said Vuorinen, who chairs the music program at Conrad Grebel University College at the University of Waterloo. As a result, Choirs Ontario have published an open letter calling on governments to make decisions based on medical evidence when ruling if and how choirs can resume practising and performing.  “Scientific study on the transmission of COVID-19 as it relates to singing is in its infancy. To date, there is no body of scientific research that definitively links choral singing with a higher risk of infection in comparison to other group activities,” says the letter. “As such, it is of great concern to choral communities that the development of Ontario public health policy around the safety of singing could be based on anecdotal evidence of a few choirs whose membership has become sick, rather than being firmly based on scientific evidence,” says the letter. The letter is referring to a COVID-19 outbreak among members of the Skagit Valley Chorale in Washington State. On March 6 and March 10 choir members gathered for practice. Some sat close together, some further apart. They had cookies and drinks during a break. Skagit County issued social distancing guidelines on the day of the last rehearsal. An investigation by the Skagit Country Public Health department concluded one person with COVID-19 attended the rehearsals and infected 53 others (33 confirmed, 20 probable). Two members died. COVID-19 outbreaks also struck choirs in Berlin, England and Amsterdam. Maybe with research, choirs could resume practising with Plexiglas shields between members, have fewer singers at rehearsals with two metres between everyone, and have everyone wear masks while singing. “But then of course the big question is: ‘How do you then come together to perform?’” said Vuorinen.  The live streaming concerts to online audiences is used by a growing list of performers during the pandemic, and some countries allow choirs to do that, he said. “I have been able to tune into some of my favourite choirs in Europe and listen to them sing, in ways that I would not have otherwise,” said Vuorinen. “It’s a bit of an exciting opportunity in a way, to think about how can we reach a different audience in a different way,” said Vuorinen. “Live streaming or recording and streaming concerts is one way we are all going to need to adopt.” Vuorinen said the open letter and his comments are about finding ways for professional choirs to resume work. “In Ontario what we are hoping is the government will take a good look at this and help devise guidelines that we can use,” said Vuorinen."

Ontario's Workplace Safety and Insurance Board is reviewing more than 300 previously rejected compensation claims from retirees or their surviving families. The review was ordered last December by WSIB chair Elizabeth Witmer, who was concerned by stories of a cluster of cancer and lung disease among workers exposed to carcinogens in Kitchener's rubber manufacturing industry.  Former workers and their widows say they're angry and deflated after getting calls informing them that after taking a second look, WSIB is sticking with its original rejections of their cases. ""They failed us again. These men, they built this city, they built this province,"" said Kitchener's Gayle Wannan. ""Did their deaths not mean anything?"" Her late husband, Lynden Wannan, worked at Uniroyal for 26 years and died of pancreatic cancer at age 49 after collapsing on the factory floor. She's convinced the chemicals he worked with played a role in his early death.  Wannan says the WSIB, which told her last week it's upholding its original decision to deny compensation, is out of touch with the hardships the workers' deaths have caused many local families. ""They're not in our shoes,"" she said. ""If I have to wait for another appeal, I'll be dead by then."" The WSIB said some claims have been overturned as a result of the review, but was not able to say how many.  ""In conducting our review, we have been able to allow some previously denied claims based on new information, scientific research or information that has changed since the date of the original decision,"" board spokesperson Christine Arnott said in a statement.  ""We want people to receive any benefits and services they are entitled to, and we have to base our decisions on scientific evidence. Unfortunately, in some cases conclusive scientific evidence linking diseases to workplace exposures does not exist."" Dave Schneider, a 79-year-old who began working at BF Goodrich in his 20s, was also told his claim for throat cancer was rejected - again. The physician who studied his case, Dr. Mike Pysklywec, argued Schneider's exposure to carcinogens in the rubber industry was a significant contributing factor with his cancer. But since the Kitchener man used to smoke, the WSIB decided it couldn't determine how much of his cancer could be blamed on his job at the rubber plant. The review panel ultimately upheld that decision.  ""They said, 'There's no change.' I said all those people died doing the same work. Smokers and non-smokers,"" he said.  ""I said, 'I want you to tell me what they died from.' You know it's all work-related. I got angry."" Virginia MacKenzie, whose husband Ross MacKenzie died in 2007 at 70 after three rounds of cancer and chronic lung issues, said she's disappointed to see the WSIB standing firm with its original decisions. Her husband worked at BF Goodrich for 38 years, and MacKenzie has long believed his health problems were job-related.  ""Are they just doing the same thing again?"" she said. ""There has to be something we can do. They just don't seem to be getting the message.""  gmercer@therecord.com Twitter: @MercerRecord "

Three days after learning his Rubber Town series into a pattern of cancer and lung disease among rubber workers in the region was awarded a $45,000 Michener-Deacon Fellowship, Mercer's series earned the National Newspaper Awards prize for local reporting at a gala in Toronto on Friday night. His detailed probe into the serious health problems that afflicted workers from the region's once-booming rubber industry - and the apparent reluctance of workplace safety officials to accept their compensation claims - won out over other nominees from the Brandon Sun and St. Catharines Standard. ""Greg Mercer's work highlights the importance of local journalism,"" said Jim Poling, editor-in-chief of the Waterloo Region Record. ""His inquisitiveness and determination as a journalist has changed the lives of people in our community and given them voice when they didn't have any. Occupational health and disease is serious business and The Record will continue to investigate."" Mercer was also a finalist for the John Wesley Dafoe Award for Politics for exposing how the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party concocted a story that a legislator had sexually harassed a former party intern, in order to nominate a more well-connected party insider. Robert Fife, Steven Chase, Sean Silcoff and Christine Dobby from the Globe and Mail won the award for looking into how Huawei fits in with Beijing's global ambitions, and just how far Canada was willing to go to accommodate the technology juggernaut's quest for expansion. The Waterloo Region Record's John Roe was also a finalist for the Claude Ryan Award for Editorials. Fran�ois Cardinal of La Presse won the award.  The Globe and Mail took top honours overall, winning 10 of 21 categories. The Globe had 20 finalists spread over 13 categories, including all three finalists in the business category. There were 63 finalists in 21 categories, selected from 951 entries for work published in 2018. The competition is open to daily newspapers, news agencies and online news sites approved by the NNA board of governors. This was the 70th year of the awards, which were established by the Toronto Press Club in 1949 to encourage excellence and reward achievement in daily newspaper work in Canada. The awards program has operated under its current administrative structure since 1989. Mercer will continue his work on the Rubber Town series after earning the fellowship from the Michener Awards Foundation. Each fellowship is worth $40,000 to pursue investigative work with a focus on the public good, and an additional $5,000 to cover expenses. Mercer will investigate work-related disease in Canada, exploring why it is under-reported and rarely compensated. Mercer first began his investigation into Waterloo Region's rubber industry last fall. Since then, he has written nearly two-dozen stories on the issue. The fellowships will be presented during the Michener Awards ceremony at Rideau Hall on June 14. All finalist entries for the NNA's can be viewed online at nna-ccj.ca."

So they gave it their best guess — deciding the rubber worker had an extremely rare condition known as Moyamoya Disease, a disorder never before seen in Canada and normally only afflicting children. Because of that best-guess diagnosis, a compensation claim by MacLean's widow was denied by Ontario's Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) this week. ""They told me they're turning the claim down because they can't find anything on the disease,"" said Jill James. ""They said the only way you could prove anything was if you exhume the body."" MacLean, who died in 1999 at the age of 54, spent the last eight years of his life in nearly vegetative state. Doctors told his family his condition was incurable, caused by a disorder that reduces blood flow to the brain and leads to strokes. ""That diagnosis never made sense to me. I think it was mislabelled,"" said James, who submitted a WSIB claim for occupational disease on MacLean's behalf in January. The WSIB, meanwhile, says a medical diagnosis is one of the biggest factors in board decisions on claims. It says the board relies ""on the best science and medical information available, in addition to other relevant factors."" ""We have to rely on the medical information that we have,"" explained Christine Arnott, spokesperson for the WSIB.  ""For a work-related illness claim to be allowed, there must be conclusive scientific evidence linking a person's disease or diagnosis to workplace exposures."" James has the right to appeal, it added. MacLean worked at BF Goodrich and Epton Industries for almost 30 years, starting at age 17. James believes he paid for that job with his life.  When he died, doctors didn't make any link to his work, and no testing for occupational exposure was performed.  James says he was exposed to chemicals that made him sick — focusing her concern on benzene, a colourless chemical used to make rubber, plastic, dyes, detergents, drugs and pesticides.  Benzene, a known carcinogen used at the Kitchener plant, evaporates quickly in the air and is commonly absorbed into the body through inhalation. It's linked to leukemia, blood disorders and immune system problems.  Some medical studies have also found links between chronic benzene poisoning and neurological abnormalities — which is why it's caught James' attention. ""They used to put their hands right in that stuff. They never showered it off,"" she said. ""If there weren't all these people dropping dead and full of cancer, I would have dropped it. That's why I find it hard to believe he's the only one in Canada with this disease."" James said she'll ask the coroner for an autopsy if that could prove workplace exposure played a role in MacLean's death. There is some precedence for such an examination in suspected occupational disease cases in Ontario. Janice Martell, a workers' advocate who has spent years gathering evidence on McIntyre Powder poisoning among northern Ontario miners, used a provision of the Coroner's Act to get an autopsy performed on her father without cost.  She thinks other families should also be allowed to request autopsies when they believe someone's death is a result of workplace exposure. ""They should be doing it, in my mind, for all of them,"" Martell said. ""If it's costing the province of Ontario a bunch of money because the WSIB keeps rejecting all these claims, then they may begin to think about the larger cost to the system."" James says she'll do whatever it takes to get an answer. The official explanations for her late husband's disorder and death have never made sense to her. ""I've gone this far, I'm not going to quit now,"" she said. ""Something needs to be done to prove that these chemicals are doing things to people.""  gmercer@therecord.com Twitter: @MercerRecord"

Kitchener's Dan McAvoy, 69, found out this week his claim for a severe, debilitating and work-related rash that dates back to the early 1980s was reopened and approved by the WSIB.  McAvoy was an electrician at BF Goodrich in 1982 when he broke out in a rash during maintenance on mixing equipment fed by the plant's big Banbury machine.  He filed a claim with the WSIB, citing a doctor's diagnosis that he had an allergic reaction to resins and adhesives used in the rubber-making process, but his claim was denied. His rash was dismissed as simple psoriasis, a common skin condition, and he learned to live with itchy, painful outbreaks for years. After a Record investigation into the rubber industry's toxic legacy, the WSIB announced in December it would take a second look at more than 300 previously unapproved claims from local rubber workers.  McAvoy, who still wages a daily battle against the rash that covers about 80 per cent of his body, is among the first claimants to have a  denial overturned as part of that process.  ""I suspected for a long time this was work-related,"" he said. ""I'm glad they've finally acknowledged it. I knew there was more going on here than just psoriasis, but what could I do about it? They denied it for so long, so I just kept on working."" The WSIB's letter to McAvoy said it investigated Ministry of Labour records from the 1970s and found evidence the Goodrich Drive plant used rosin, a compound made from pine trees (also known as colophony), as a raw material in tire building. As a result of that discovery, the WSIB approved McAvoy's old claim on the basis of ""severe contact dermatitis."" He's waiting to find out how much he's entitled to for what the WSIB deems a ""non-economic loss"" that caused a permanent impairment. The WSIB traced his outbreak to Jan. 2, 1983, after McAvoy spent about a week over Christmas on a maintenance project that left workers covered head-to-toe in old rubber dust.  ""We were in this stuff, working away, all covered in black. The only way you could see who somebody is was to tell them to smile and see the whites of their teeth,"" he said.  McAvoy said he's lucky compared to co-workers who developed cancer or other life-threatening diseases that they believe were work-related. He worked at BF Goodrich until the plant closed in 2006, and put in 30 years with the company. Now he's hoping his is just the first of many more old claims where the WSIB admits it got it wrong. There are too many former rubber workers with too many troubling health issues for them all to be dismissed as unrelated, he said. ""I don't want to be a poster-child for the WSIB. Part of me worries they're just trying to be seen as taking some action,"" he said. ""It's easy to say no to one or two people, but it's much harder to say no to a crowd. Now all of a sudden, the crowd is coming out of the woodwork."" gmercer@therecord.com Twitter: @MercerRecord"

Jim Brophy said while the decision to reverse 31 of approximately 300 previously denied claims following the WSIB review is a ""good first step,"" a royal commission is needed to address occupational health risks and the compensation system across Canada. Brophy is a University of Windsor adjunct professor who has studied occupational disease for more than 30 years. ""The rubber worker stories really cry out for an open, public inquiry into what is happening in terms of occupational disease and the lack of recognition by the compensation system,"" Brophy said in an interview Tuesday. ""I don't think that 31 out of 300 is anything close to what needs to be done."" A royal commission consists of a panel of experts appointed by cabinet to conduct a full investigation into specific problem at the national scale. When an investigation is complete, the findings are reported to cabinet and the prime minister for appropriate action. Former rubber worker Chris Haufe, who spent 25 years working for Dominion Tire, Uniroyal and BF Goodrich in Kitchener, and another six years as president of the United Rubber Workers Local 80, called the decision to reverse just 10 per cent of the cases a ""tragedy"" for workers and their families. ""They're brushing us under the carpet again,"" he said. People who worked in the local rubber industry suspected for years the chemicals used in their job were making them sick. In some cases, workers or their surviving families fought the claims and appeal process for more than a decade, only to have their claims denied. Haufe, who turns 91 in just a few days, retired 30 years ago and had surgery for colon cancer about five years ago. He submitted a claim to the WSIB, but doesn't know if it's one of the 31 that were approved. He said he's waiting to receive a letter from the agency. ""After I retired, life was not much fun anymore,"" he said of his health struggles in recent years. ""When you came out of there, if you only had back pain you were lucky."" The WSIB review was ordered last December by board chair Elizabeth Witmer, who was concerned by stories of a cluster of cancer and lung disease among workers exposed to carcinogens in Kitchener's rubber manufacturing industry. The WSIB announced Monday it had concluded its review and that 31 previously denied claims will now be accepted due in part to new evidence and updated scientific research, while another 24 claims are currently under appeal. That means the vast majority of claims reviewed by the WSIB over the past 10 months (253) will remain denied. An additional 174 claims have been filed since the review was launched, and they are now being adjudicated through the regular claims process. Witmer said she can understand the frustration that some workers or their families feel, especially those who didn't have their denial reversed, but she's confident the panel of experts reviewed each case individually and gave them the attention they deserved. ""They did the best job they possibly could,"" she said. She also noted the province is reviewing occupational cancer in Ontario. It's being led by Dr. Paul Demers, director of the Occupational Cancer Research Centre at Cancer Care Ontario. Demers wasn't available for comment Tuesday. Of the 404 WSIB claims filed between 2002 and 2017 by former employees of some of Kitchener's largest rubber companies, only 15 per cent were accepted. The claims were for a variety of illnesses, including various types of cancer. The WSIB did not release any information related to the 31 claims that were accepted after the review, or the compensation that will be handed out. Brophy said no matter what the number is, it'll never be enough. ""There's no trade or no amount of money that brings back your loved ones. So much of the damage has been done over the past decades - some people lost their homes, retirements were destroyed, families were left devastated,"" he said.  ""So whatever the financial remuneration is, it's not going to be anything what would even be seen as remotely fair."" jjackson@therecord.com Twitter: @JamesDEJ "

In a statement sent Wednesday to The Record, the Waterloo-based company said the recent incident may have involved unauthorized access to an employee’s email inbox. “Our investigation revealed that the incident may have exposed a small number of individuals’ personal information,” the statement said. “We want to stress that we are not aware of any misuse of this information, and have notified individuals who may have been impacted and offered to cover the cost of credit monitoring for 12 months.” In a brief phone conversation, vice-president and chief financial officer Michele Falkins said the data breach affected less than 1.5 per cent of policyholders, but she would not disclose the total number of policyholders. Heartland’s website says it has more than 50,000 policies provincewide, but it’s not clear if that statistic is up to date. The Record obtained a copy of a letter, dated July 2 and printed on Heartland letterhead, stating the incident occurred between March 27 and April 3, and may have exposed names, addresses, banking information, social insurance and credit card numbers, driver’s licence information and, in some cases, passport information. “Protecting personal information is a top priority for us,” the statement released Wednesday said. Heartland said it immediately took steps to block the unauthorized access and secure the information, brought in a team of cybersecurity experts, and “engaged all relevant authorities.” “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Heartland Farm Mutual Inc. is committed to further improving its security in order to prevent this from happening again.” Falkins said Heartland would not be commenting further.

Now, in the midst of the pandemic that’s ramped up stress levels and obliterated the line between work and home for many, the YMCAs of Cambridge & Kitchener-Waterloo are extending that mission to the workplace. A new program for workplaces will be developed by three people with extensive experience in workplace culture and employee well-being — Jim Moss, Dave Whiteside and Nate Robertson, all formerly of Plasticity Labs. Financial problems forced the Kitchener tech company out of business in April. Founded in 2013 by Moss and his wife, Jennifer, the firm developed a platform to improve workplace happiness and employee engagement and performance. As a Plasticity customer, the YMCA saw the benefits the platform brought to the charity’s own employees, said chief executive officer Peter Sweeney (the two YMCAs share a common organizational structure). “They helped us understand, through the insights of our employees, how best to make this a great place to work.” While the YMCA program won’t be focused on technology, the trio of ex-Plasticity staffers bring the experience needed as the Y embarks on this experiment. “They know how to work within the workplace context to uncover the emotional needs of employees,” said Sweeney, who reached out to Moss to propose the idea. COVID-19 has exposed some of the cracks in society, and some of those are rooted in the workplace, Sweeney said. Remote work has left many employees craving connection. Child care is a major strain on families right now. Front-line workers in sectors ranging from health care to retail are under unprecedented stress. “Would other organizations benefit from a non-profit like the Y coming in to help them understand what their employees need?” Sweeney asked. “This is an opportunity to test a theory.” For Moss, the new program presents an exciting challenge that turns the page on the difficult decision to close Plasticity Labs, one that left him feeling he’d failed employees that found themselves out of work. “I spent some time to distill what I learned about myself from the Plasticity experience,” he said. High on that list was the understanding that he cared deeply about improving the workplace experience for others. Specifics about how the program will work and what services may be offered are being considered, but they know a one-size-fits-all approach won’t work. “If you don’t come into it with an open mind, you’re in trouble,” Moss said. “We don’t pretend to have all the answers that workplaces need,” Sweeney added. “We’re willing to take a risk to try it.” Moss will lead the project, as vice-president, workplace well-being. Whiteside is a “powerhouse” in data collection and interpretation, Moss said, while Robertson, a skilled problem-solver with a background in design, will join the team part-time. The program will serve the local YMCAs’ coverage area, which includes Waterloo Region, Guelph and Stratford. As a social enterprise, proceeds from program fees will be reinvested in the charity. While it will be fee-based, the YMCA wants to ensure that all organizations, including non-profits, can participate. As the Y itself adapts to a changing COVID-19 landscape, “we have to be thinking about different ways to diversify our offerings,” Sweeney said. “We think it’s an innovative way for us to support our community.”"

Its technology, simplifying the photo and video production and editing process, has already been used behind-the-scenes in blockbusters like the 2019 remake of “The Lion King.” It’s in use for other film and television projects, too, ones that Monogram’s chief executive officer, Calvin Chu, says they’re “super-excited” about but can’t disclose due to confidentiality agreements. “We’re seeing more and more enterprises and larger studios using our tools,” he said. “It’s been spreading through word-of-mouth.” A new collaboration with Epic Games, the video gaming giant behind “Fortnite” and “Gears of War,” could further expand Monogram’s reach. The Monogram Creative Console, the modular system that swaps out a keyboard and mouse for a customizable series of dials, sliders and other controllers, will be integrated with Epic’s Unreal Engine. Unreal Engine is a game engine — essentially, the development software used to create the video games — but it’s gaining popularity among film and TV productions because of its ability to create and manipulate incredibly-realistic virtual locations and elements that can be blended in real time with traditional techniques.  The Star Wars series “The Mandalorian” is one example of a production that’s used Unreal Engine to create virtual sets. Epic Games awarded the Kitchener company a $50,000 grant to help develop Monogram’s Unreal Engine solution, allowing users to assign different Unreal Engine controls or connect their own custom plug-ins to Monogram modules.  “Monogram’s customizable hardware controller can unlock powerful tactile experiences in virtual worlds created in Unreal Engine,” Epic’s David Morin said in a release. Monogram technology was already compatible with popular photo, video and music production applications such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Lightroom Classic and Capture One. Whether it’s controlling lighting or colour balance, or even focusing or moving a virtual camera, the Creative Console can provide a customized workflow for production teams. The intuitive controls feel familiar to directors and cinematographers, said AJ Sciutto of Magnopus, the company in charge of creating a virtual production workflow for “The Lion King” last year. “It simplified the on-set experience, making it one of the crucial tools to our virtual production workflow,” Sciutto said in the release. Virtual production, which includes combining digital elements in real time with live action, rather than strictly in postproduction, was already gaining in popularity thanks to efficiencies and cost savings that don’t sacrifice quality.  Travel restrictions and physical distancing requirements brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic are proving the benefits of virtual production even more, with traditional shoots placed on hold. “We wanted to build the best tools that fit this new type of creator and new workflows that are constantly being invented,” Chu said. Virtual production blends leading-edge digital technology with cinematography techniques that have been refined for a century. “We’re excited to be at the cutting edge, and being able to work with the first handful of people who’ve started to pioneer this,” he said. Monogram is partnering with Sheridan College’s Screen Industries Research and Training Centre, located at Pinewood Toronto Studios, in the use of virtual production techniques. Monogram has also just moved to a new office at 305 King St. W. in downtown Kitchener, with a layout that offers more separate rooms and opportunity for distancing than their prior location. The company currently has 15 permanent employees and a few others on contract. Founded in 2013 as Palette, the company rebranded last year with the announcement of a new and improved version of its system, the Monogram Creative Console. Production and supply chain delays caused by the pandemic have slowed its release, but Chu said it’s expected to launch in a few weeks. “We’re just about ready to ship.” The Monogram hardware used in film and television production is identical to the consumer version; there will be an enterprise version of the software that’s a bit more specific to the studios’ needs. “All of the functionality we’ve built for Hollywood, making the hardware extremely reliable and professional quality, we’re bringing that to everybody,” Chu said."

The Kitchener-Waterloo Association of Realtors said sales were up 57.6 per cent over May’s statistics, with 673 homes sold last month. That’s even a 2.1 per cent increase over June 2019, and 8.5 per cent higher than the previous 10-year June average. “After a pandemic-induced delay to the typical spring market, home sales sprung back to life in a big way in June,” association president Colleen Koehler said in a news release. “As Waterloo Region entered stage two of reopening, we saw many buyers and sellers resuming their home buying and selling plans.” Sales plummeted in March following the declaration of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 crisis. April sales were the lowest the association had seen in a single month since December 2008. But things began to turn around in May, which saw an 80 per cent increase in the number of homes sold compared to April’s results. The average price of all residential properties sold in June rose 12.8 per cent compared to June 2019 to $601,285 — this is the first time the Kitchener-Waterloo association has seen the average price top $600,000. The average price for a detached home is quickly closing in on $700,000, rising 13.2 per cent year-over-year to $698,736. The median price for all properties rose 14.4 per cent in June to $564,000, while the median price for a detached home climbed nearly 12 per cent to $650,000. The June average price stood at $372,392 for an apartment-style condo, up 13.2 per cent. Townhomes rose 11.4 per cent to an average of $457,851, while semi-detached homes were up more than 17 per cent, to $504,816. It will still take some time for sales to completely recover from the impact of COVID-19. Open houses are still prohibited in Ontario, and face-to-face real estate business is discouraged; virtual tours and other technologies are taking their place. The association said total home sales in the second quarter were down 33 per cent compared to last year, and down 15.6 per cent on a year-to-date basis.　 “I expect for the remainder of 2020 (we’ll) see the number of home sales returning to near historical levels,” Koehler said. “There will be some catching up to do in the coming weeks, but I don’t think you will see the market taking a hiatus this summer.” Low inventory continues to drive prices higher. Although 920 new listings came on the market in the Kitchener and Waterloo area last month — the most new listings in a single month in more than a year — there were still only 640 homes available for sale at the end of June, down 28.7 per cent compared to last year. Homes took an average of 16 days to sell in June, compared to 20 days a year ago."

Finance Minister Carole James said the numbers are staggering with job losses of 235,000 since February and a predicted GDP decline of 6.8 per cent by the end of this year. “We were preparing for economic moderation, we were well-equipped to be able to weather the challenges,” James said at a news conference Tuesday. “What came next was unprecedented. Mere weeks after Budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed.” The government has provided $6.26 billion in financial aid to businesses and individuals. Among the losses it anticipates this fiscal year because of the pandemic are close to $1 billion in personal income tax, $973 million in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax, James said. The projected GDP decline in 2020 would be the worst on record going back to the 1980s, although it is also projected to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2021. James said for context, B.C.’s real GDP has only declined twice in the past 40 years, falling by 2.4 per cent in 2009 and 6.4 per cent in 1982. “As those numbers remind us, this could be the worst downturn experienced in our province recent history,” she said. B.C.’s restart plan is showing signs of hope for the economy as consumer confidence increases, she said. The unemployment rate is slowly rebounding and fewer wildfires and floods have helped the bottom line. However, she warned that the province’s financial forecast could change depending on many risk factors, including the possibility of a second wave of infections, the possibility of a vaccine, as well as the success of relief measures and central bank policy. Regardless of how B.C. copes with the pandemic, James said its economy is also subject to the economic health of other jurisdictions, particularly those that buy from the province. James said it wouldn’t help the economic recovery to pull back on spending, but the government will review every cent spent as it heads into the next budget year. The B.C. government has tabled legislation giving itself room for three years of deficits, which James said will be re-examined each year. James said she believes people care about provincial deficits because they understand it’s taxpayer money, but they also understand the emergency the pandemic created. She declined to predict how long the recovery would take, given the many moving pieces at play. “There is no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the economy of British Columbia and that’s not short term,” she said. The job losses have been widespread but some have been disproportionately affected, depending on a worker’s age, gender or which sector they work in, James said. Young workers are among the hardest hit, with the unemployment rate rising sharply from 9.1 per cent in February to 29.1 per cent in June for those aged 15 to 24. Women, who dominate the service industries and many of whom have also left jobs to care for family members, are another group more affected. Their unemployment rate rose from 4.8 per cent in February to 13.4 per cent in June. The hardest hit industries include wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services, construction, culture and recreation. The overall unemployment rate of 13 per cent remains at its highest level since 1987. While the job losses in March and April were record breaking, the figures for May and June have seen modest recovery as the economy started to reopen. “The projected numbers are staggering but they’re not without hope. Things are getting better each and every day when we follow the provincial health officer’s advice,” James said. The NDP government’s fiscal update was met with calls for an economic recovery plan by its political opponents, with the Opposition B.C. Liberals asking what happens when federal benefits like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit run out. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson also suggested the government should reconsider its pre-pandemic spending priorities. “People in every corner of B.C. have had to adjust to a new normal and adapt their household budgets, so why is this government pretending it’s business as usual?” he asked in a statement. The Green party said the province should transition to a green economy by helping traditional industries become more sustainable, spending on training and building local businesses into the supply chain. “We can seize the once in a generation opportunity to strategically drive stimulus spending towards a future British Columbians want: an innovative, low-carbon, sustainable, just and inclusive economy for all,” interim leader Adam Olsen said. — By Amy Smart in Vancouver.

They offer classes to members on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 7:30 a.m. in Liberty Village and Regent Park. They have spots for nine people in each session. All F45 locations are looking forward to reopening safely when the province gives the nod, Webster said, adding that they may continue outdoor classes if the demand is there. “We are going to prioritize the in-studio experience and the safety protocols there, but if there’s a way for us to continue doing the F45 Track, or the outdoor boot camps, then we may,” Webster said. F45 isn’t the only gym in the city that has adapted for COVID-19 protocols to retain and engage their clientele. At Sweat and Tonic on Yonge and Shuter streets, the first outdoor classes in mid-June were such a hit, the gym added more to its weekly schedule. Classes have nine participants, all social distancing, and range from HIIT, to yoga, to running. They take place either at 50 Gould St. on Ryerson’s Campus or at the Underpass Park at 29 Lower River St. Bolo, at 364 Richmond St. W., holds a strength and agility class Friday mornings at Stanley Park, outdoor boxing on Mondays at 6 p.m. at Canoe Landing and a run on Tuesday evenings. RedLeaf Fitness launched its outdoor programs June 25 outside the gym at 662 Caledonia Rd., and posted the socially distancing workout groups to its Instagram account. Some of these classes are open to non-members who can pay per class or for a number of classes. It’s different for every gym. Prices range from $20 and $45 per session depending on the activity. Sweat and Tonic charges $20 per outdoor fitness class. "

Energy and materials led the S&P/TSX composite index despite flattish oil prices and a dip in gold. Meanwhile, the heavyweight financials sector also climbed. In all, the Toronto index closed up 269.04 points or 1.7 per cent to 15,908.45. That’s the largest daily gain since June 5. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 556.79 points at 26,642.59. The S&P 500 index was up 42.30 points at 3,197.52, while the Nasdaq composite was up 97.73 points at 10,488.58. Second-quarter bank results were mixed but provisions for credit losses were much higher than expected at nearly US$27 billion for three banks. Shares of JPMorgan Chase increased after the drop in profits was less than expected on gains in capital markets while Citigroup shares dropped on a steep decline in profits. Wells Fargo sank 4.6 per cent after cutting its dividend and posting its first quarterly loss since the 2008 financial crisis. Bank executives said in conference calls that they underestimated how long the pandemic would last and its impacts on the overall economy. “I think you’re seeing weakness in the banks generally as some of the smaller regional banks are more heavily weighted towards lending and have less capital markets exposure so less of an offset as we proceed through earnings,” said Natalie Taylor, a portfolio manager with CIBC.  Meanwhile, she said there seems to be some flattening in the growth of COVID-19 infections outside of Florida despite larger outbreaks in some states. “The sense is that maybe the worst in the surge is either near or has already occurred,” she said in an interview. Taylor also said investor sentiment has improved on increased certainty that the U.S. Congress will pass another fiscal stimulus package by the end of the month to extend some income benefits and provide some support to state and local governments. “The market has continued to look through the spike in cases that we’re seeing in the states basically because we’re probably not going to see a broad shutdown of the economy again like we did in March and that there’s going to be stimulus on the other side,” she said. The Canadian dollar traded for 73.44 cents US compared with 73.71 cents US on Monday. Ten of the 11 major sectors on the TSX were higher with only real estate decreasing. Energy rose 4.1 per cent despite slight increases in crude oil and natural gas prices. Seven Generations Energy Ltd. rose 7.9 per cent while Whitecap Resources Inc. and Crescent Point Energy Corp. were up about six and 5.4 per cent respectively. The August crude contract was up 19 cents at US$40.29 per barrel and the August natural gas contract was up 0.7 of a cent at nearly US$1.75 per mmBTU. Taylor said the crude oil market is being affected by OPEC discussions about reducing product cuts, which she said would be “manageable in the context of the market.” In addition, former U.S. vice-president Joe Biden’s clean energy initiative unveiled Tuesday may not be as punitive for the oil and gas industry as may have been expected. Materials climbed three per cent with Kinross Gold Corp. up 5.4 per cent and B2Gold Corp. up 4.3 per cent despite lower metals prices.

Stage 3 of Ontario’s reopening allows indoor gatherings of up to 50 people with two-metre physical distancing still in effect. But gym and studio owners say operating at a significantly reduced capacity with little federal financial support might not be feasible and many may choose to stay closed or shut their doors for good. Jennifer Lau, owner of Toronto studio FitSquad, said the nature of the business means many independent gyms and studios don’t qualify for the federal wage subsidy, since their trainers are often contractors. With limitations still unclear, she said the smallest of these businesses may not be able to fit more than a handful of clients in their space. Some are tearing down walls to make more space to make it worthwhile, she said.  “We’re just waiting for the actual guidelines because right now it’s a little vague and there’s so much room for misinterpretation,” Lau said. “We’re doing our best.”  Lau is also the founder of the Save Health and Wellness Coalition, which has been advocating on behalf of studios like hers for a rent relief extension, among other things. The next six months to a year will be a struggle, she said, as it may be a while before gyms can allow more clients in. The coalition had pushed for studios to be included in Stage 2, since they are appointment-based — she likened them to tattoo studios, which were allowed to open. But to no avail. “Our industry is going to be hit so hard,” she said. When her 6,000-sq.-ft. studio does reopen, it will be at 30 to 40 per cent capacity, or a maximum of 20 people including staff, more than many studios that have smaller square footage. She said trainers and clients will work in pods, and classes will be limited to between eight and 10 people. But many studios are trying to decide whether reopening will save their business or prolong its inevitable closure. That’s the situation in which Portia Albrecht finds herself. Albrecht owns the Generate fitness studio in Bloor West Village, a larger independent gym at around 6,000 sq. ft. that offers barre, yoga and spinning classes and has a weight training and equipment area as well. Albrecht, who is currently working as a nurse in Boston, doesn’t know whether or not she’ll be able to reopen her studio, even with the federal rent relief program.  “It doesn’t look good,” she said. It’s not just the reduced capacity or the increased costs — she’s also not sure people are ready to return to the gym. Albrecht surveyed her clients and found that fewer than 30 per cent were willing to return to the gym right away. And for those who are willing, she’s concerned nervousness about the pandemic could overtake the feeling of community and cause friction between clients. She believes the rent relief program should be extended, though even that might not be enough for Generate, she said — her rent alone is $25,000 a month, but there are many other costs as well, and it’s not a hugely profitable industry to begin with. “It’s going to take a long time to build the numbers back up to where they need to be.”  Alex Kucharski, a director of the Ontario Independent Fitness Studio Association and an F45 studio owner in Toronto, said many gyms and studios have pivoted to online and outdoor classes to stay afloat, but that these offerings are not sustainable. He believes small studios have an advantage over the big gyms because they are generally a more controlled environment, with planned classes instead of walk-ins. Kucharski said independent fitness studios are often beloved members of the business community — and many have already closed their doors for good, including Toronto Newsgirls Boxing Club, a boxing gym that focused on women and trans people as clients. Some gyms have taken to their community to stay afloat. For example, Bloor Street Fitness & Boxing has a GoFundMe campaign with a goal of $80,000 — donor comments call the gym inclusive and socially focused.  Kevin Charles, who owns an F45 studio in Toronto, said the rent relief program and federal $40,000 loan could help his studio stay open, since the wage subsidy doesn’t apply to his subcontracted employees. Both he and his landlord are in the process of applying to these programs. He has been offering online classes “out of necessity” to help cover his bills, and hopes the rent relief and loan programs will kick in soon, as he will be operating at a third of his usual capacity when he can reopen the studio. Charles is doing everything he can to help his clients feel safe returning. He recently purchased an electrostatic sprayer to more efficiently and effectively disinfect the space and equipment. He hopes the rent relief program is continued to help small businesses like his weather the next several months."

The 77-year-old Bollywood patriarch’s image is ubiquitous across the country on advertisements for everything from hair oil to cement, and his infection — along with actor son Abhishek, daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai and granddaughter Aaradhya — ignited something akin to an outpouring of national grief. Bachchan’s illness also highlighted one of India’s most acute and chronic inequalities that’s been accentuated by the pandemic: access to quality health care. He and his son were hospitalized in one of Mumbai’s best private hospitals, although they had only mild symptoms, at a time when ordinary citizens have been struggling to find a bed in crowded state-run hospitals, or are being denied medical care by private facilities outright. As India struggles to contain the world’s third-largest outbreak — adding nearly 30,000 new cases every day — such inequalities will make it even harder to stem the pathogen’s spread. “The double standard is the rich get treated in India and the poor don’t,” said Leena Menghaney, a lawyer and public health activist based in New Delhi. “That’s very starkly played out in the fact Amitabh Bachchan has survived tuberculosis, he’s survived hepatitis B, and now he will get some of the best treatment for COVID-19.” As the outbreak intensified in recent months, government hospitals have become overwhelmed — especially in Mumbai and New Delhi, the two worst-hit cities. Widely reported instances of some private hospitals and doctors refusing to treat COVID-19 patients have been blamed for deepening the crisis. The private sector accounts for around 60 per cent of India’s total hospital bed capacity. Shocking stories abound: a patient in Mumbai was asked to sleep on the floor until a bed was available in state-run facility, while another woman suffering brain damage was turned away by private hospitals which would not treat her unless she had a certificate proving she was virus-free. A pregnant woman died in May after being denied help by three private hospitals in the outskirts of Mumbai. Virus Dashboard The health care facilities in Mumbai have since been bolstered, with the local government taking over 80 per cent of the beds in private hospitals, drafting doctors into compulsory virus duty and setting up a dashboard showing the availability of beds for COVID-19 patients. But the speed and ease with which citizens can access these facilities differs. In June, a government survey conducted by Ayushman Bharat, an agency that administers a health insurance scheme for the poor, found that 22 of 101 private hospitals had provided so few services that they were deemed inactive. Out of a group of 96 private hospitals asked if they’d provided any COVID-19 treatment, 81 said no. The Bachchans encountered no such difficulties when they fell ill and were admitted to Mumbai’s Nanavati Hospital, a private facility close to their home. Bachchan emerged as Bollywood’s premier superstar in the 1970s and is seen as India’s answer to Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino, playing “angry young men” characters battling corrupt establishments. While other actors of his generation have seen their fame fade away, Bachchan has only grown in stature. Besides dozens of endorsement deals and critically acclaimed film work, he also hosts the Indian edition of “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” and cameod in the 2013 Hollywood film, “The Great Gatsby.” His son Abhishek, also a superstar, is married to actor and former beauty queen Aishwarya Rai in one of Asia’s most famous and photogenic unions. “He’s considered to be sort of a national treasure so if something happens to Amitabh Bachchan it’s considered to be a failure of the government,” said Menghaney, the health care activist in Delhi. Slum Dwellers Despite the Bachchans’ infection, COVID-19 remains largely a disease of the poor in India, with hot spots concentrated in slums and tenements where social distancing is all but impossible. Many there depend on daily wages and cannot work from home. And even if beds are available in private hospitals, few can afford them. As the lockdown is eased across India and Mumbai’s elite start allowing their cleaners, cooks and drivers to return to their homes, the health of the city’s richest people will remain intertwined with its poorest. “The private health-care system has completely failed on this occasion. The message is that if you don’t pay to take care of the health of the poorest, the richest are also not going to be safe,” said T. Sundararaman, the New Delhi based global co-ordinator of the People’s Health Movement, a health care access advocacy group. “Therefore universal access to health care should be seen as a universal public good.”"

As senior director of principal gifts for the University of Texas at Austin, he helped set goals for his team of fundraisers, assisted them in meeting those goals and celebrated their successes when they did. He aimed to be supportive and encouraging, but delving into staffers’ personal lives? Inquiring about their support networks? That wasn’t part of the job description. But as the country abruptly shut down in one unimaginable week in March, Spearman, like many managers at companies large and small, found himself taking on new roles: counsellor, supporter, wellness coach. Goals and metrics temporarily went out the window. The mental and physical health of his staff became the priority. As Spearman scheduled one-on-one meetings with each member of his team, he wrote a checklist of things to talk about: Where are you living? How comfortable are you going out? Are you getting food delivery? Do you feel safe? He also invited each team member to share their biggest fears. “That was a watershed moment,” he said. One of his employees is married to an assistant manager at a grocery store, and the thought of him going to work every day terrified her. Another feared that her partner, who worked in the hospitality industry, would lose his job. One person was scared of being sick and alone, another worried about an elderly parent living in another state. At the same time Spearman shared his biggest fear: that he would get sick and not be able to get a test for the virus. It was the most vulnerable he’d ever been with his staff. “I wanted to let them know I’m in the same boat,” he said. As businesses grapple with the economic fallout and disruption caused by the coronavirus, experts say the pandemic may have a silver lining: Helping to create a new breed of managers — those who talk less and listen more. “There is an element of this crisis that is forcing managers to be the kind of managers people always wanted, which is really caring about their team’s welfare, and really listening,” said David Rock, director of the Neuroleadership Institute and author of “Your Brain at Work.” Inquiring after the well-being of employees and understanding their unique challenges has always been part of good management strategy, said Samuel Culbert, author of the book “Good People/Bad Managers” and a professor at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management. Before the pandemic, it may have been easier to gloss over. Today, however, knowing who may have recently lost a loved one, and who is chasing after a toddler half the day, has become essential information for any team leader. “Most managers may intend to help their employees, but they don’t start off with the most basic questions: What do you need? How can I help you?” Culbert said. A manager may not be able to solve everyone’s problems, he added, “but you can listen, give, support and back them up.” As the weeks passed and Spearman’s team settled into their new reality, he gradually turned the focus back to fundraising goals. But the more intimate relationships he established in the early days of the pandemic remained. “This has been a transformative experience for me,” he said. “We talk about productivity, but we also talk about canoeing and coffee with friends. I’m learning to manage that whole person, not just the performer.” Studies suggest that the stresses associated with COVID-19 are affecting people on every rung of the corporate ladder. In a global survey of 2,700 people, the technology company Qualtrics found that self-reported declines in mental health in the early days of the pandemic were equally likely across all seniority levels — from executives (40.5 per cent) to individual contributors (44 per cent). “Nobody is going through this unscathed,” said Ryan Smith, chief executive of Qualtrics. Supervisors may worry that inquiring after the mental health of their employees is inappropriate, or none of their business, but the data suggest otherwise. The Qualtrics survey found that 57.7 per cent of respondents said they are comfortable with their manager proactively asking them about their mental health, and 41 per cent said they want their managers to ask them about it. And when respondents were asked who they would rather talk to about mental health issues, 35.6 per cent said a co-worker or peer, 33.5 per cent said a manager or supervisor, and just 19.5 per cent said somebody from Human Resources. “Traditionally, mental health has been one of those taboo topics — don’t ask, don’t tell,” said Michael Thompson, president and CEO of National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, a non-profit employer group. “But when you break the silence, employees like it. They think more highly of you as an employer.” At the same time, many managers are experiencing their own fears and challenges, and experts say it is important for them to monitor their mental health as well. “You have to get your own stress level low enough so you can focus on someone else,” Culbert said. He recommends a buddy system in which managers check in on one another and share challenges and stressors. Smith is already doing this. Before the pandemic he had a standing weekly call with 12 other tech CEOs, but after COVID-19 upended everything the conversation took on a new tone. “It’s turned into a therapy group,” he said. Felicia Jadczak was expecting 2020 to be a year of growth for She+ Geeks Out, the Boston company she co-founded that helps companies create a more inclusive workforce and runs networking events in tech and tech-adjacent fields. As the country went into lockdown, Jadczak’s anxiety grew as client meetings got cancelled, contracts vanished and sponsors began pulling out of She+ Geeks Out events. At the same time, she and her co-CEO, Rachel Murray, had to transition their small staff to working from home, which meant ensuring everyone had a functioning internet connection and a suitable space to work. But the biggest hurdle was emotional, Jadczak said, “just understanding what everyone was going through — not just the team but me and my business partner, too.” Some employees had small children at home, others were supporting older family members. “Every meeting started with, how are you? Is your family safe? Are you OK? And really listening,” Jadczak said. The two women say they don’t mind taking on these additional responsibilities, but they require emotional energy. As Jadczak put it, “It’s a lot of lift.” After the news of the police killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor began circulating, Jadczak and Murray added a weekly meeting to the team’s agenda that they call “the hang” — as in hang out. “We found that our team needed some time to come together and process and chat like we were in the office, around the coffee machine,” she said. They also experimented with giving everyone, including themselves, a four-day workweek. Even as the demand for their training services has skyrocketed in the wake of the national reckoning on racism sparked by George Floyd’s killing, Jadczak and Murray plan to continue with four-day workweeks. “We don’t want anyone to burn out,” Jadczak said. Tracy Keogh, chief human resources officer at HP Inc., which has 55,000 employees worldwide, said her team has also worked to alleviate burnout by urging employees to shift 30-minute Zoom calls to 25 minutes, and hour-long calls to 55 minutes. It may not seem like much, but the small breaks make a difference. Here in Los Angeles, Merrick Lackner, co-founder of Rently, a company that helps renters see homes and apartments without a listing agent, said the coronavirus has helped him to get to know his 50 employees in a whole new way. “Ironically, it’s easier to make surface-level assumptions about people when you see them every day,” he said. “But with everyone apart, we’ve been having deeper, more honest conversations.” Since the pandemic started, Lackner has made more of an effort to reach out beyond his direct reports to find out how other staffers are doing, and hear what they think should be happening at the company. “To be frank, I should have been doing it all along,” he said. As for Spearman, he’s learned that he doesn’t have to pry into his employees’ lives to let them know he’s available to talk if that’s what they need. It’s like having someone to your house and offering them coffee and a cookie, he said. They don’t need to take it, but it’s nice to know it’s there."

On a single income of $70,000, is it time to leave the city?",['Evelyn KwongToronto Star'],"Mon., Jan. 13, 2020","They’re both just 26 years old, but Amy and Jake are already the parents of a 10-month-old baby and a French bulldog. Their family lives in Toronto’s High Park area, renting a place for $1,830 per month. They had to find it quickly — they were kicked out of their previous apartment when the landlord’s daughter needed a place to stay after university. “(We) really struggled to find an apartment that fit our budget that could accommodate Jake being six-foot-two,” Amy says. “We ended up paying way more than we wanted, but we don’t plan to stay long.” With no debts, they have dreams of buying a home outside the Greater Toronto Area to start their family. But recently Amy suffered health problems that prevented her from returning to work after the pregnancy. Read more Millennial Money here.  Now, they live on a single income of $70,000 — earned by Jake who’s a software developer. “We live a very modest lifestyle, but things are still tight living on one income,” she says. On top of the goal of buying a home within two to five years, the couple is also hoping they can start an Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) for their baby. They say that they’re not big spenders and make frugal day-to-day choices to boost their savings. “We try to home cook as much as possible,” says Amy. Breakfast and dinner are almost always made at home. For lunches, Jake takes leftovers to work, but occasionally grabs a sandwich to go or heads to a restaurant with colleagues. Sometimes, with his stressful work schedule, he’ll opt for a snack from the vending machine. At home, Amy’s schedule is also jam-packed. With the doctor’s checkups, taking the baby to free play groups, walking the dog and grabbing groceries, the errands can pile up.  On the weekend the couple have a bit more time to indulge their interests, such as geocaching — an outdoor activity using GPS to play hide-and-seek with containers marked in specific locations — and taking part in free community events with the baby.  The two want to move out of their expensive rental spot soon and hope a financial adviser can provide some clear direction on how to start. We asked them to share everything they bought in a typical week: The advice: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners, says it sounds like Jake and Amy are having a tough time financially with the decrease in income due to Amy’s health problem and the added stress of a new baby to provide for, coupled with a new, more expensive rental. Here’s his advice: > Living outside the GTA could have a big impact on their cost of living. There are surrounding suburbs and towns with considerably lower real estate prices. The potential commute into the GTA is a real consideration, though. There’s a cost to that — both literal and figurative — especially when you’re raising a family.  > Amy’s health problems highlight a real risk for them. What happens if something prevents Jake from working? They’re paying health premiums, but don’t appear to have life or disability insurance — they should get on that.  > I’d also question the health premiums. They’re paying out of their bank accounts, so this makes me think it’s not a company or group plan, but rather an individual health insurance plan. I’d take a close look at what is actually being covered currently, and what could actually be covered based on the plan maximums. > The RESP is a great idea for their little one. That said, given cash flow is tight, and their child isn’t even a year old, I’d maybe hold off for a while. RESPs provide 20 per cent government grants on your contributions up to $2,500 per year. But you can catch up on a full previous year in a future year. > They may not have a car payment now, but they will eventually have to budget for a replacement. Especially if they move outside the GTA. > Despite the common advice to start saving for retirement while you’re young, I’d really be focused on getting through these lean years with a newborn and hopefully getting Amy back to work and getting into a cheaper rental. Overall, there are pros to the way they are living, Heath says. “Good on them for cutting costs with mostly home cooking. Their minimal spending on coffees and lunches will help keep their expenses low at a time when their cash flow is tight.” The results: They actually spent more in the second week (but it was the holidays!) Spending in week 1: $611.16. Spending in week 2: $821.45. What she thought: Amy and Jake say that despite spending more, they did “quite well” seeing as it was the holiday season — therefore gifts galore! “This week was a bit unusual for us leading into Christmastime with buying gifts for family, drinks for a Friendsmas party and extra gas for driving to our parents’ houses.” Take-aways: Being a cautious pair, the couple says that Heath’s advice helped affirm several things they were already hoping to do. First, they’ve decided to cancel their health insurance after crunching the numbers. Also, following the advice, they’re holding off on the RESP contributions for the baby until they have more cash flow.  Another big change? They’ve moved up their timeline to leave Toronto. “We love it here, but it really doesn’t make financial sense to live here anymore, especially now that Jake has five years of post-university work experience and can apply to a wider range of jobs in less expensive cities,” Amy adds. After doing the #MillennialMoney challenge, they say it was reassuring to find out that they’re doing a good job of limiting their spending.  “It’s nice to have an expert affirm things that we felt in our gut.”"

With a bit of time and effort, you can be — and it will almost certainly lead to a stronger financial position. Here are five ways to become money smart:  Make a date with yourself every week to work on your finances Financially literate people spend at least 20 minutes a week learning about money matters and staying on top of their finances. They read about wealth, meet with advisers, work on their budget and pay bills.  Whether they like the subject of money or not, immersing themselves in financial learning every week helps the financially literate stay on top of financial goals.  Carve out time every week to start learning about money. There are literally thousands of free resources online, and hundreds of documentaries to watch. Start with a search about how to save more money. Investigate lenders before committing to one In a recent survey conducted by Loans Canada, nearly 40 per cent of respondents — all of whom were already indebted — skipped out on comparing offers from lenders. Unfortunately, loan stacking — having multiple loans from multiple vendors — tends to be a result of not being strategic about what you borrow for, and from which lender. And that stack of debt can be tough to handle efficiently. Comparing loan terms, rates, frequency and amount of payments allows you to make an informed decision and gives you leverage to negotiate with competitive offers. And it’s fairly easy to do through online loan and rate comparison websites.  Work your budget A 2019 Government of Canada financial capability survey found that Canadians who stick to a budget — about half of those surveyed — are better able to stay on top of their spending. People who budget also tend to have squirreled away enough savings for emergencies and retirement plans. One of the biggest barriers that non-budgeters say gets in the way is a lack of time. There are, however, hundreds of digital tools to speed up the process compared to even a decade ago. And if you prefer to keep your banking separate from your budget, you could use a free Google budgeting template. Keep a pulse on your credit score Financially literate people keep an eagle eye on their credit score to prevent fraud and to monitor their progress toward improving it. Generally speaking, a score less than 600 is suboptimal with 900 being the highest. Paying bills on time and in full and reining in your credit cards is the best way to improve your credit score.  And there are plenty of free credit score tracking services like CreditKarma.  Seek the advice of a qualified professional  When it comes to your personal finances, never guess. There’s just too much at stake. If you don’t know what to do about your finances, or you are just unsure, get help.  Having low financial self-awareness is dangerous and generally leads to poor money decisions. Working with a professional, even if it’s just for the short-term, can help improve your financial self-awareness and increase your financial literacy. "

Can they afford a home?",['Evelyn KwongToronto Star'],"Mon., March 2, 2020","Emily and Tom are both 26 years old. Emily, a registered nurse makes $69,000 a year, while Tom, an apprentice tradesman, makes $44,000. Their monthly spending adds up to around $6,000, and the $300 to $800 left over goes straight into paying off debt. “We’re looking to buy a house ASAP,” Emily said. What’s the rush? The couple, who currently rent a home in Scarborough, just found out they’re expecting. “Ideally we’d settle in Whitby, but our budget for homes is under $300,000,” she said. The two also say London is a good option to look at, but before real estate becomes a reality, Emily still has to pay off $12,000 in OSAP debt and Tom has to pay off $5,000 remaining of a consolidation loan from a fitness membership that went wrong.  “Hopefully we can pay it off by the middle of next year,” Emily said, adding they are eager to start their family life. They’ve tried to be frugal to make their dreams a reality. In a typical workday, Emily and Tom pack a lunch. Emily will treat herself to a Starbucks drink three times a month while Tom buys a coffee and breakfast once a week. “Also, we both eat out from a fast-food restaurant once or twice a month.”  On the weekends, the two are typically homebodies unless they’re going to a friend’s house. Also for their date nights, they try to find ways to budget. “We never go out to drink, we go on dates maybe once every three months and typically spend just shy of $100 per date with food included.”  Their two largest monthly spends? $1,695 split between the two of them on rent, more than $700 on car insurance, about $550 on groceries and $400, which is non-negotiable, for charity. On top of their more realistic goals, the couple is hoping to finally go on vacation for the first time. “We’d also like to go to either Disney World, Ireland, or the Caribbean for our first vacation sometime in the next few years,” Emily says. We asked the couple to send in a sample of their weekly expenses for a #MillennialMoney expert to examine. Here’s what happened. The expert: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners Inc., has advice for the couple, who he says, has an exciting year ahead. > It sounds like the home budget is pretty modest at $300,000. They will need a minimum 5% down payment or $15,000. > As they are considering a home purchase, remember that with babies come changes in income and expenses. I’m sure some sort of a parental leave for one or both of them will reduce their combined income for a period of time. EI maternity and parental benefits will replace only a portion of their incomes. > I would focus the extra $300 to $800 leftover cash each month on Tom’s consolidation loan. It is likely the interest rate is higher than Emily’s OSAP loan rate.  > Debt repayment may be a better option than investing given the interest rates they’re paying, especially given their time horizon for a home purchase seems short. It’s not wise taking risk to invest if you may need your money in a short period of time. > One thing to consider while Emily is off work is she may have the opportunity to buy back service in her pension plan. This is often a good opportunity to take advantage of and she should consider it during or after her maternity leave. > Having a baby is a good time to re-evaluate insurance coverage and estate planning. Both Emily and Tom may need more life insurance. If they don’t already have wills and powers of attorney, they should consider them in advance of their new addition to the family. > It’s hard to criticize generous philanthropists, but this couple should consider whether an expected decrease in income and increase in expenses should cause them to reconsider their $400 per month in donations, even if it is just temporarily.  The results: They spent less. Spending in week 1: $2,262. Spending in week 2: $551.91. What Emily thought: Compared to last week, the couple is proud of how little they spent. “We will save from there,” Emily said. Next goals: “We’d like to reduce spending on snacks and coffee.” Added bonus, Tom will no longer need to use the 407 toll to go to work as he did in week 2, which will mean more savings.  Take-aways: With help from the Millennial Money expert, now Emily and Tom have shifted into looking more seriously into how to buy a home. “We will likely have to rent to save up for a down payment and maybe will need to pay off debts before purchasing a house as well,” Emily said.  In addition to that, the two had already planned to transfer any child tax benefits into an RESP, so they were glad to hear this affirmed by the financial coach as the “best investment strategy.” Despite the desperation to pay off debts, the couple agree their charitable contributions are still not debatable, and that they will continue to give just as much.  Instead, they’ve found different areas to save money. “Emily’s family lives here, and they have offered child care which would offset child care costs with her return to work,” Tom added. "
45,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/business/2019/02/08/how-a-home-equity-line-of-credit-works-and-what-it-might-really-cost.html,How a home equity line of credit works - and what it might really cost,['The Canadian Press'],"Fri., Feb. 8, 2019","OTTAWA - A home equity line of credit may be a cheap and easy way to borrow money to pay off your lingering holiday bills or consolidate high-interest debt, but experts caution that you need a plan to repay the money. They say it is all too easy to only make the minimum monthly payments to cover the interest and never make any progress on reducing the amount you owe. ""It is so easy to stay in debt for a long, long period of time,"" says Scott Hannah, chief executive of the Credit Counselling Society. Hannah says consolidating high-interest debt using a home equity line of credit that charges a lower rate of interest can be a good plan, but you need to understand how much you can afford to borrow, the interest rate you are going to be charged and how are you going to repay it. Too often, he says, a HELOC is used by those who are spending more than they earn to cover daily expenses. ""It can really mask spending behaviour, it can really mask the fact that a person may not be managing their financial affairs well,"" Hannah says. A HELOC is secured by the value of your home while the interest rate charged is normally linked to the big bank prime rates and fluctuates as that rate changes. The Bank of Canada has raised its key interest rate target five times since the middle of 2017, moves that have driven up the cost of borrowing. A report by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada says HELOCs are the largest contributor to nonmortgage consumer debt, more than double that of either credit cards or auto loans. However, Michael Toope, a spokesperson for the agency, says the survey found many consumers don't understand how the lines of credit work. ""People are not very familiar with the terms and conditions of the loans, these lines of credit, and they generally don't have great plans for paying them back,"" he said. Just 15 per cent of HELOC holders knew that a financial institution can increase an interest rate at its discretion, while 45 per cent knew there are fees to transfer a HELOC to another institution. The FCAC survey also found that one in five HELOC holders borrowed more than they intended. The most popular use of a HELOC, according to the survey, was for home renovations at 49 per cent, while 22 per cent said they used their HELOC for debt consolidation. Toope says if you are going to use a HELOC you need to know what the money is going to be used for and how you are going to pay it back. ""You need to know why you are borrowing that money or why do you need that line of credit,"" he said. Hannah says if you have a plan and understand the risks, a HELOC can be helpful. ""A low rate line of credit is a good product if used properly and with a specific purpose,"" he says."

Resolve to make contributions to an RESP (registered education savings plan) that allows the funds to grow on a tax-deferred basis."" - James McCreath, portfolio manager, The McCreath Group, BMO Nesbitt Burns Private Client Division  ""This winter, resolve to keep warm by dressing for the temperature. Don't leave your car running to keep it warm. If you are parked and waiting, turn off your vehicle. Idling can burn one to two litres of gas per hour, while restarting your car only uses about 10 seconds worth of fuel."" - Kristine D'Arbelles, senior manager of public affairs, Canadian Automobile Association  ""Budget permitting, resolve to maximize your charitable tax credit by giving more than $200 for the year. For every dollar you give beyond that amount, you get a 29 per cent tax credit federally, and you may reach over 50 per cent tax credit when you factor in the provincial credit. Remember that this credit is also transferable between spouses and can be carried forward for five years."" - Gerry Vittoratos, Canadian tax software company UFile  ""Resolve to be patient with yourself. Purchasing a gym membership will seem like a great investment when you achieve results. Also, choose a location that is convenient for you, speak to a fitness professional about your options and check to see if your employer has a corporate rate."" - Jason Sheridan, senior vice-president of operations, GoodLife Fitness  ""Resolve to save money, live comfortably and reduce pollution by upgrading your lighting, insulation and appliances at home and at work to energy-efficient alternatives to reduce your utility bills. Use the sun's free energy with renewable energy technologies to meet your heating and power demands."" - Saeed Kaddoura, analyst, Pembina Institute  ""Book your flights early.

We’re not even close to that moment when it comes to Ottawa’s COVID-19 spending, but that feeling is starting to set in. So far, deficit spending has reached $343 billion this year covering everything from wage subsidies and unemployment benefits to money for seniors, students, rent relief and loans to business. It may look like some politicians believe we can spend our way out of the economic shock, recession, and, perhaps, depression headed our way. But what if tax dollars aren’t the only way to free up much needed investment dollars? What if there was a way to encourage Canadians to use their own capital to provide stimulus and support Canadian business? Wealthy Canadians and corporations are holding cash and there are few incentives for them to invest in private Canadian businesses.  While the 2008 global economic crisis hit the big banks hardest, today’s calamity has struck a death blow to small business with little in the way of assistance coming from Ottawa. That’s not to say a few small loan programs haven’t been helpful; they just haven’t moved the needle, and many small business owners have been reluctant to take on the risk of additional debt. A recent survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business found that 25 per cent of small businesses will close their doors if they sustain a 50-per-cent drop in revenue for a month. Many Canadian business owners are already well past that point. This is a tragedy. Small businesses are the heart and soul of the Canadian economy. If you are a successful small business owner who has built a nest egg over many years, it is unlikely you will double down during a pandemic and reinvest your savings to keep your business afloat. If you are evaluating an investment in, for example, a tech company looking for additional capital, the risks have increased significantly.  Unlocking private capital would provide additional support from Canadians who are not only looking for a return, but are also emotionally invested in the business’s success. We’ve seen grassroots, microscale economic support for small business in communities across the country, including from community crowdfunding platform Distantly.ca, which enables individuals to send funds directly to local businesses. The platform was conceived to make sure Mainstreet was still open post lock down. Businesses such as restaurants, salons and gyms, which are closing their doors daily, would benefit greatly from an incentive for Canadians to make a much bigger commitment with that support. Small businesses have a desperate need for capital to invest in digital transformation, working capital, personal protective equipment and other modifications required to comply with new pandemic regulations. If Canada is going to emerge from this crisis stronger and more resilient, we need tax policy to encourage Canadians to invest in our small businesses. We are not looking for anything unique or groundbreaking here. A handful of Canadian provinces have tax policy that encourages private investment in small business. New Brunswick has the Small Business Investor Tax Credit program, the most generous in the country. If you live in New Brunswick and invest in a small business, you get a personal income tax credit of 50 per cent of your investment up to maximum of $125,000 annually. Corporations, trusts, co-ops and local economic development agencies are entitled to similar benefits upon investment. In the last five years, the program has generated almost $450 million of investment, supporting 2,200 small businesses in New Brunswick.  The federal government needs a bold, game-changing tax policy that will encourage Canadians with capital, including small business owners, to step off the sidelines and invest in small business. We must establish qualifying parameters that encourage small businesses to grow. We must set the bar high in defining “small business,” so we don’t discourage growth.  The U.S. does this well. Section 1202 of its tax code allows for tax-free capital gains of up to $10 million or 10-times the investment if it is in a private business with up to $50 million in assets. It’s a bold idea. That is easy to implement, were Ottawa so inclined. As New Brunswick did, the federal government could provide an income tax credit to Canadians for investment in small- and medium-sized businesses. Business owners who double down and reinvest in their own business, could get a tax holiday on income earned, or charge no tax on dividends paid, for up to three-times the invested capital. For investors looking to back potential high-growth entrepreneurs, the program could provide tax-free capital gains — up to tenfold.  Ottawa has the power to do all of the above.  High-income earners in Canada pay more than half of their income to the government, not including municipal and sales tax. Why not create a plan where Canadians can choose to provide private stimulus and invest in the small businesses and entrepreneurs so vital to the Canadian economy? "
48,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/business/personal_finance/opinion/2020/07/13/a-biden-presidency-what-would-it-mean-for-the-markets.html,"If Joe Biden becomes the next U.S. president, what would that mean for the markets?",['Gordon PapeContributing Columnist'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","If the public opinion surveys are right, the majority of Canadians would prefer to see Joe Biden defeat Donald Trump in the November U.S. elections. And if the pollsters in the States are correct, that’s exactly what is going to happen. Biden appears to have a wide lead at this point. Of course, a lot can happen in four months. But if the status quo holds, what would a Biden win mean for investors and the Canadian economy? Potentially, a lot. So far, the former vice-president hasn’t unveiled much in terms of his platform. But his first major policy statement sent shock waves through the oilpatch and cheered environmentalists. In mid-May, the Biden campaign announced that one of his first acts as president would be to rescind the permit allowing TC Energy to build the Keystone XL pipeline. That action would kill the project once and for all. President Barack Obama rejected Keystone on the grounds that it would contribute significantly to climate change. As his VP, Biden strongly supported the move, so it’s no surprise he would act quickly to reverse Trump’s approval of the project. That would be a huge blow to heavy oil producers and to the province of Alberta, which is investing $1.5 billion to cover construction costs to the end of 2020. That’s a lot of tax dollars down the drain if Biden indeed pulls the plug. The Keystone XL announcement is a clear tip-off to what else we might expect from a Biden presidency. It would probably be the greenest administration in U.S. history, especially if the Democrats are able to retain control of the House and wrest the Senate from the Republicans. The Green New Deal put forward by the party’s left wing is a smorgasbord of ideas aimed at tackling climate change on a grand scale. Some of the proposals are probably unworkable, such as upgrading every building in the U.S. to meet specific environmental standards. But it is likely that a Biden administration would promote some of its key goals, including the use of green energy at the expense of fossil fuels, and subsidizing electric vehicles and low-emission high-speed trains. Under Biden, the U.S. would almost certainly rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and we should expect a lot of reregulation in the environmental sector, reversing the deregulation of the Trump years. Relations with Canada should improve significantly. Biden does not believe in using tariffs as a political lever. He and Prime Minister Trudeau share many of the same views and profess to be good friends.  In other areas, I would expect a Biden government to roll back some or all of Trump’s prized $1.5 trillion (all figures U.S.) in corporate and personal tax cuts. The plan was passed in 2017, when the Republicans still controlled the House. Not one Democrat voted for it. The cuts provided a huge boost for corporate profits but, instead of investing the money in plants, equipment and jobs as the government hoped, billions were spent on share buybacks and raising dividends. That caused a backlash that extended to Capitol Hill and is still simmering. The Trump administration was running a huge deficit even before the emergency spending for the pandemic. The Congressional Budget Office now projects a shortfall of close to $4 trillion this year. That means the cupboard will be bare if Biden takes office in January. What better way to start replenishing it than by rolling back those tax cuts? Canada would be an indirect beneficiary if that were to happen as it would restore the tax advantage we offered to corporations before the Trump cuts. How would stocks react to all this? If recent history is any indication, the markets would rise in the first year of a Biden presidency. That has been the pattern in every year but one since 1985. The exception was 2001, the first year that George W. Bush was in office, when Sept. 11 sent the market tumbling. Stocks will not respond well to a boost in corporate taxes or an overaggressive climate policy. But they would get a big lift if a coronavirus vaccine is developed and an economic recovery appears to be underway if and when Biden takes office. One thing we can say with certainty: a Biden presidency would be light years removed from the turmoil of the Trump years. That would come as a relief for a lot of people."

It’s Canada’s problem, too. The range of potential harms to Canada include supply-chain disruptions and renewed American protectionist sanctions against Canadian industry. That’s in addition to the hammer-blow the prolonged pandemic has already dealt to Canada’s vast tourism, hospitality and conventions sector, deprived of U.S. business and vacation travellers. Americans getting sicker instead of healthier — opposite to what their northern neighbours have achieved — has so far not significantly diminished the roughly $1 billion in daily trade between the two countries. But that changes if the “rocket-ship” economic recovery that U.S. President Donald Trump promised Americans last month fails to materialize, with U.S. elections just four months away. A promising U.S. economic rebound from mid-April into June has stopped far short of full recovery. And some sectors, notably retail, are back in decline. Fear of infection is keeping Americans out of stores that have reopened after lockdown. So is the lack of a second round of U.S. pandemic relief cheques, in sharp contrast to the continued flow of federal income supports in Canada and the European Union (EU).  Weakness in U.S. consumer sentiment will eventually inflict damage on Canadian online retail and business-to-business sales in the U.S. market. It will also harm Canadian firms doing business directly in the U.S., including Canadian banks, insurers, retailers and property developers. If the stall-out in the U.S. economic recovery continues into the fall, the economic pain for Canada will spread from tourism and retailing into the Canadian manufacturing, resource and agricultural sectors. Americans buy Western Canadian livestock, B.C. timber and almost every drop of Alberta oil. Demand and prices for each have already been weakened by the pandemic.  Economic conditions in both the U.S. and Canada are deeply worrisome. The U.S. jobless rate in June was 11.1 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent just before the pandemic, and not far shy of the peak 11.9 per cent during the Great Recession of 2008-2010. The Canadian jobless rate peaked at about 14 per cent in the second quarter, Bill Morneau, the federal finance minister, said this week. It is expected to fall back to pre-pandemic levels of about seven per cent by the end of next year. The U.S. economy is forecast to shrink by about six per cent this year. Canada’s economy will shrink by 6.8 per cent, by the feds’ reckoning, before rebounding by about 5.5 per cent in 2021. But Ottawa’s projections for a robust economic recovery are pinned on a strong U.S. rebound. A Canadian export-driven economy tied to the U.S. market will, of course, fail to reach those recovery targets if the U.S. pandemic continues to drain America of economic vigour.  In contrast to the pandemic progress made by many major economies, the U.S. continues to report record numbers of new COVID-19 cases. Last month, Canada’s rolling seven-day average of daily new cases fell by 75 per cent. In the U.S., it rose by 37 per cent, reaching all-time highs of 50,000 or more new daily cases this week. As Paul Krugman, the Nobel-laureate economist, pointed out last week, Arizona, population seven million, has been reporting more new daily cases than the entire EU, population 446 million. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infection-disease expert, warned this week that, at the current rate of growth in new U.S. cases, America could be reporting upward of 100,000 new COVID-19 cases per day. The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that for every reported case of COVID-19, there probably are at least another 10 that have gone unreported. The U.S. already leads the world in reported COVID-19 cases and fatalities.  While many countries are preparing for an expected second wave of the virus, “We are still knee-deep in the first wave,” Fauci said. It is troubling for Canada’s economic prospects that the Trump administration is in denial about America’s failed response to the pandemic. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said this week that “The world is looking at us as a leader in COVID-19.” Trump himself said this week that COVID-19 will “sort of just disappear.” That isn’t the view in California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, where COVID-19 appears to be raging out of control and hospitals are close to overcapacity with COVID-19 cases. As to world opinion, a recent survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations found that just two per cent of European respondents believe the U.S. has been “helpful” in the fight against COVID-19. Given the resourcefulness of Americans, one has to believe conditions will improve, just as especially hard-hit jurisdictions including South Korea, Germany and New York City were able to stop the spread. But for now, Canada needs to brace for potential disruptions in U.S. supply chains. For example, Canadian grocers should be looking now for alternatives to California and Florida in citrus supplies. These are largely harvested in those U.S. states by migrant labour more vulnerable to COVID-19 than the general population. Otherwise, Canadians might be hit this winter with higher prices for oranges and other citrus products, and the economy will suffer a rise in food-related inflation.  We also need to brace for a new round of Trump protectionism. With his re-election prospects gloomy, Trump has returned to launching trade disputes. Their purpose is to deflect attention from the pandemic and to show concern about a faltering economy. That too is a worry for Canada. Coming into 2020, there was some hope among Canadian lumber producers and the U.S. homebuilders they supply that America’s long-standing punitive tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber might finally be lifted. Instead, the pandemic and Trump’s renewed protectionism have turned softwood lumber talks into dead letter. And the White House is musing about a renewed tariff assault on Canadian aluminum imports.  Canada is hardly the only target of Trump’s resurgent protectionism. His latest “America First” trade sanctions are also aimed at the EU as a whole, EU member Germany in particular, and Vietnam and other U.S. allies. All that against the backdrop of Trump’s trade war with China. Even before the pandemic, U.S. trade disputes, since ramped up, were depressing global GDP growth. “If the U.S. cannot get a handle on the virus, and if its leadership chooses a protectionist route to economic recovery, Canada’s return to normalcy will be that much harder,” Philippe Lagassé and Srdjan Vucetic, international affairs professors at Carleton University and the University of Ottawa, respectively, wrote recently. If only a get-well card to America signed by Canadians would make a difference. Be well. Remember that a new City of Toronto bylaw requires the use of masks in enclosed public spaces."

The region was the only office market in Canada to see a decrease in vacancy in the second quarter, according to a new report from commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE. Nationwide, the office vacancy rate rose from 10.3 to 10.8 per cent. Nearby London saw its rate climb from 14.7 to 15.7 per cent. The local results may not be indicative of what’s to come in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, if more companies decide to give up or reduce office footprints in a shift to permanent work-from-home or a hybrid model. But the statistics show the office market is still healthy for now, said Ted Overbaugh, CBRE’s Southwestern Ontario managing director. “We had a good quarter and I think that’s positive, and I kind of worry it’s not telling the whole story.” It can take months to plan a large office move, so it’s difficult to directly link rising vacancy rates in other markets to a pandemic that only began significantly impacting Canadian workplaces in early to mid-March. “We’re really only three months into this,” Overbaugh said. “It’s tough to say if those deals were already inked.” The percentage of vacant space that is sublet is trending upwards across the country, including in Waterloo Region, and that may hint at future moves, Overbaugh said. “It is a bit of a sign of companies rethinking their operations and their size and needs.” But as some companies shed space, others may find they need more in order to accommodate permanent physical distancing measures. “I don’t think the office market is dead, by any means,” he said. Most of Waterloo Region’s available sublet space is in the suburbs, the report found, and represents only 5.8 per cent of all vacant office space, the third lowest in Canada. The completion of projects including the new office building at 345 King St. W. in Kitchener will add office space to the core; CBRE said that building, which will be anchored by law firm Gowling WLG, is 40 per cent pre-leased. Overbaugh said the industrial sector remains active overall, despite a bit of a pause in the second quarter; he believes it will be the strongest performer this year. “There’s still good value to be had,” he said. “K-W is very stable. The values haven’t completely shot up like neighbouring markets.”  CBRE said more food and beverage firms are looking for industrial space in midwestern Ontario, while logistics and warehousing needs for the surging e-commerce segment continue to rise. “E-commerce was already trending, and retail was on the down slope,” Overbaugh said. “We’ve probably sped that up three to five years.”"

The number of homes sold through the Kitchener-Waterloo Association of Realtors in May spiked 80 per cent over April, with 419 residential properties changing hands last month. April’s sales were the lowest the association had seen in a single month since December 2008, as pandemic fears caused many buyers and sellers to put their plans on hold. “Consumer confidence, I think, is coming back,” said association president Colleen Koehler. With the market virtually paused for the second half of March and April, “we honestly didn’t know” what May would bring, she said. “I think it’s a little more significant than we anticipated.” There’s still quite a hill to climb to return to pre-pandemic sales levels; May’s sales represented a 40.5 per cent drop compared to results in May 2019. Average prices continue to rise year-over year. The average for all properties rose 6.5 per cent to $568,275, while the average for a detached home rose 5.4 per cent to $657,274. Those averages were virtually unchanged compared to April. The May median price for all properties rose 10.1 per cent over May 2019 to $545,000, while the median price of a detached home increased 9.6 per cent to $630,000. Apartment-style condos saw the lowest price growth; the May average sale price of $330,336 was up just 0.6 per cent compared to May 2019 results. Townhomes saw the average price rise 13 per cent to $454,197, while semi-detached homes were up 11.4 per cent to $482,479. A recent Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) report forecasts a tough road ahead for Canadian real estate, with predictions that housing prices nationwide could fall 9 to 18 per cent from first-quarter levels this year before starting to recover next year. In Ontario, CMHC predicts that decline won’t reverse until the third quarter next year; it could be the latter part of 2022, or later, before prices return to pre-pandemic averages. “The precise timing and speed of the recovery is highly uncertain because the virus’s future path is not yet known,” CMHC’s chief economist, Bob Dugan, said in a release. Koehler doesn’t believe the worst-case pricing scenarios will play out in Waterloo Region. “Time will tell. Obviously, what happens in the next six months will be crucial,” she said. “We still have a fairly strong economy here.” Historically-low inventory levels are helping to maintain higher prices, with homes in lower price categories still attracting multiple offers, Koehler said. While the association saw more new listings come on to the market last month than in April, with 577 residential properties put up for sale, it’s still a far cry from the previous 10-year average of 1,035 new listings in May, and represents a nearly 50 per cent drop over new listings in May 2019. Although traditional open houses are still prohibited in Ontario, virtual open houses and tours are proving popular, and the Ontario Real Estate Association has issued extensive health and safety guidelines when in-person showings and meetings are necessary. “We’re seeing more sellers feeling more comfortable about listing their properties now,” Koehler said."

The retail and office sectors could see the biggest changes as Waterloo Region emerges from pandemic lockdowns. In the past few weeks, several area businesses, ranging from bars and restaurants to tech firm Plasticity Labs, have already announced they won’t ever reopen. This week, Shopify — with hundreds of locally based employees and a large footprint at two Waterloo offices — said it will prioritize a work-from-home model going forward that throws its long-term need for substantial square footage into question. Shopify will maintain “recruitment hubs” in cities including Waterloo, the company said, but it’s not clear how much of its more than 100,000 square feet in Waterloo that will require. “Office space demand is a widely contested debate and consensus sees the future of office as having a mix of both options for staff to either work from home (WFH), from a dedicated office space, or combination of both,” Mitchell Blaine, of commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE, wrote in an email. “Both WFH and dedicated office spaces have their pros and cons and decisions by tenants over the next many months will be highly dependent upon the companies’ culture, financial health and future growth prospects.” Before March, the absorption rate of office space had been increasing, Ginger Whitney of Whitney & Company Realty said Thursday during an online discussion hosted by Communitech. Since then, the absorption rate has been in a holding pattern. “We don’t have the same velocity we once had,” Whitney said. “We are keen to see a correction happen, and to see what’s next with office space.” Blaine said he’s found that office leasing — and renewals in particular — has been continuing, while most sales have been extended or paused. “Large office expansions have been put on pause for the most part as many office tenants work to determine their optimum balance of WFH and dedicated office space needs,” he added. Spacing considerations might actually increase square footage needs if companies retain physical offices, Whitney and colleague Steph Snyder both noted in the online forum. New standards will probably eliminate bench-style seating, dividers and barriers may be required, HVAC systems might be outfitted with filters, and offices might be subject to random inspections, Whitney predicted. The retail market was already experiencing challenges pre-pandemic with the rise of online shopping, and those are now being heightened, Blaine said. Aside from grocery stores and pharmacies, retail properties “are the hardest hit and will likely be last to recover,” he said. Industrial/warehouse and apartment properties remain a bright spot, with strong momentum continuing, Blaine noted. Demand — and related investment — for logistics and e-commerce warehousing is on the rise. Commercial tenants may find opportunities as landlords work to avoid or fill vacancies, Snyder said. A sublease could provide short-term, flexible space at a good price, for example. Other firms may look to lower costs by sharing offices where staff from different companies come in on a rotation, and the space is intensively cleaned in between, said Whitney. “No landlord wants vacancies right now,” Snyder said. “There’s just so much uncertainty as to when those vacancies are going to fill.”"

She’s the grandmother of Ashley Thomson, who was just four months old when she was ripped from her car seat and sucked up as high as a three-storey building by the twister at Pine Lake on July 14, 2000. The twister set her down, completely naked, a few hundred metres away on a golf driving range. She had little more than a cut to her left foot. “It is a miracle,” Thomson, who’s now 73, told The Canadian Press at her family farm northwest of Pine Lake. “Her mommy finds the car upside down with the car seat hanging there, with the clips all still done up, but no baby. “The car did several flips down the hill and her father remembers just seeing her little bare feet go out the window.” The child dubbed “Miracle Baby” in news headlines is now a business student at a college in nearby Red Deer. The 20-year-old didn’t learn about her near-death experience until she was five or six. “As I got older, it sparked an interest in me to hear everyone’s stories,” she said in a text message. “I was even more curious what happened to me. “What happened to me that day no one, including me, will ever know. The one thing I do know is that I had someone looking over me and my entire family.” Thirteen Thomson family members were at the Green Acres RV park that day. Heather Thomson said she had gathered about a half dozen nieces, nephews and grandchildren into their fifth-wheel trailer when the storm hit, bringing with it hail the size of baseballs. “I look out the window and I see two little boys running but they’re not going anywhere ... then these big chunky hailstones start to fall. I said to all these kids, ‘You guys all get down on the floor. Grandma’s never seen hailstones this big!” she said. “We’re lifted up in the air and we’re thrown down. The refrigerator came and hit my husband in the face. The microwave came out of the cupboard. The dishes all fell on top of us. And then the stronger part of the tornado, the back, turned us upside down.” She suffered broken ribs and a shoulder injury. Her husband, Butch Thomson, now 75, had blood gushing down his face where the fridge had struck him. With a finger, he traces a scar barely visible from his forehead, to the side of his nose, and down to his jaw. “I bet in 20 seconds it was over ... We were just up and down and upside down and that was it,” he said “I was kind of stunned there for the longest time. I didn’t know what the hell had happened.” Jillisa Thomson was five. She remembers being in the trailer with her grandparents. “I remember them lying over top of me and then us flipping and flipping ... We stayed for a bit and then we walked up this hill,” she said. “I remember Grandma trying to carry us up this hill and she’s just broken.” Dean and Rachel Thomson were also injured. He had stayed in the car with their baby, while his wife went into the campground office to check in. She was sucked up by the tornado and slammed into trees before she dropped to the ground. He was banged up in the car, then frantically searched for their missing daughter before finding her on the golf course. Ashley Thomson said she may not remember the tornado, but her parents and the rest of her family do. “This anniversary shows me their strength and bravery and I couldn’t be more blessed,” she said. “This experience changed my life. I believe that whoever was watching over me that day wants me to do great things.” Forest growth has covered most of the scars at the campground. Trees have been replanted and rows of trailers sit at campsites A large rock stands as a memorial near the lake and is surrounded by one tree for each person the tornado took from the world. “A tribute to a community which suffered great loss but showed great support, courage and heroism. Remembering those who lost their lives,” reads a plaque with the names of the dead. Heather Thomson said she and her family feel blessed. “Because we should have lost people. Other families lost family members. “We’re all alive and really no lasting physical effects from it. Maybe some mental ones, but we’re all pretty healthy.”"

The call for answers comes as the government tries to chart a way forward for the new Canada Student Services Grant, which has been in limbo after WE Charity withdrew from administering the program amid controversy over its links to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family. The Liberals have billed the grant program as a way to reward tens of thousands of students who want to help with the COVID-19 pandemic and can’t find paid work. Participants were told they could earn up to $5,000 toward their education costs by volunteering the maximum 500 hours. Opposition parties say the Liberals could have accomplished the same task without controversy by putting the money into the Canada Summer Jobs program, through which thousands of positions for students are subsidized by the federal government every year. “The government chose specifically to ignore the opportunity of the Canada Summer Jobs and instead went for this,” Conservative economic development critic Dan Albas said of the Canada Student Services Grant. “It makes no sense ... They put a ton of money — $912 million — towards an untested concept when they have a ready-to-go program.” The Liberals have expanded the summer-jobs program by increasing the wage subsidy available to companies and not-for-profit groups to 100 per cent of the local minimum wage, expanding what types of positions qualified and extending the eligible work period to early next year. Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough’s office also noted the Liberals injected an extra $60 million to create 10,000 more positions than last year for students. The move brought the total budget for the program to $323 million and the expected number of summer jobs to 80,000. “This additional investment is helping more youth stay connected to the labour market, save money for their return to school, and find quality jobs in safe, inclusive, and healthy work environments,” Qualtrough spokesperson Ashley Michnowski said in an email. “By adapting the program this year, our government is making sure that we have the resources needed to support Canadian workers, businesses, and communities dealing with the social and economic impacts of COVID-19.” But the opposition says the available funding is not enough to cover demand in a normal year. The federal Employment and Social Development Department itself says on its website that in 2019, “requests for funding totalled more than three times the program budget.” Neither the government nor WE have said how many volunteer positions they were expecting to fill through the $912-million grant program. There has been criticism that participants receive only $10 per hour — less than the minimum wage in any province. There have also been questions about many positions advertised as available through the volunteer scheme, including thousands for students to shoot videos, make websites and create other content in placements apparently created by WE to meet the requirements of the volunteer program. NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus said that stands in contrast to the summer jobs program after the government asked members of Parliament across the country to identify potential positions in their ridings in the spring — many of which did not get funding. “We had really legitimate organizations ready to hire students to do legitimate work, and all of that was sidelined,” Angus said. “These were a lot more credible positions than making a video showing how to do exercises.” The Liberals have indicated they plan to move ahead with the volunteer program despite WE’s withdrawal, saying the federal Employment Department has taken over and is looking at ways to make it happen. But the Conservatives, NDP and Greens all say the government should learn its lesson and put the money into the Canada Summer Jobs program, which is already managed by the government and has a history of success. That starts with revisiting what the Tories and New Democrats suggested was the large number of summer jobs requested by businesses and not-for-profits and not funded because of a shortage of money. “The government should be focused on a program that is transparent, that is fair, that is broadly supported by all parties, and that already has a number of applications that have been ranked and have not been filled just because there’s not enough money,” Albas said. Green MP Elizabeth May said organizations that applied for positions through the student-volunteer program should also be allowed to transfer their requests to the summer-jobs program. And if that is not possible, Angus said, the government should be looking at taking the money and putting it into direct financial support for students, including by adding the funds to the Canada Emergency Student Benefit for those unable to find work due to COVID-19. “They have two options: One is to put that money into Canada Summer Jobs and one is to put it straight into the support for university students so they have the funds necessary to go to school and cut out all these schemes they worked out with WE,” he said. “I think they need to move on this immediately. The summer is getting close to half over. It may be at this point too difficult to get the Canada Summer Jobs up, but there are a lot of organizations that we submitted names for.” Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet, meanwhile, repeated a call on Tuesday for Trudeau to step aside in favour of his deputy Chrystia Freeland while the WE affair is fully investigated. But Blanchet said that based on what’s known now, he doesn’t believe the Liberal government should fall over it."

The girl known publicly as Amira was found on the side of a road last year after her parents and siblings were killed in an airstrike, and she was taken to a refugee camp. Her uncle, known as Ibrahim, has been trying to get her out of Syria and to Canada but the federal government has refused to help. His lawyers filed a lawsuit in Federal Court on Tuesday saying that in failing to assist the child, the government is violating her rights. “Ibrahim has done everything humanly possible, including travelling to Syria on his own without security or protection, in an effort to bring his niece home to Canada,” the application says. “The respondents, despite their statutory and international law obligations and the rights of the applicant Amira, guaranteed by the charter, have for more than a year been unwilling to take a single step to enable the repatriation of Amira to take place.” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been asked on June 29 why the federal government wasn’t doing more to get Canadians out of the region. Trudeau said while there are countries that have diplomats on the ground in Syria, Canada is not one of them and it remains a dangerous place. “We will continue to ensure that we’re keeping as a priority the protection of Canadians working abroad, particularly in this COVID context, but in every context,” he said. In the court application, lawyers note that other countries with no consular services in Syria have leaned on other countries or humanitarian groups to help repatriate their citizens. The court documents state that Amira is one of 47 Canadians, 26 of whom are children, stuck in northeastern Syria. The regional government has urged countries to repatriate their citizens. In the court documents, lawyers say Ibrahim met personally with officials to plead Amira’s case. The documents say he was assured that upon Canada’s request, and coupled with the attendance of a delegate or representative of the Canadian government, the local government “would be only too pleased to facilitate the repatriation of Amira to Canada.”"

The government says research suggests the alerts have disproportionately targeted racialized families, and it’s committed to creating a more culturally appropriate child welfare system. It says that while birth alerts have never been required under provincial law, they have been inconsistently applied across children’s aid societies. The government says the practice must end by October 15, and societies must instead work with hospitals and community-based service providers to come up with pre and postnatal plans that better support families. The announcement comes two weeks after the Manitoba government officially ended birth alerts in that province, a move that took effect on July 1."

While he declined to answer questions from media, in a emailed statement Tuesday, Chief Scott Woods said while he was “deeply disappointed” in the actions and attitudes of the two officers, he took “some consolation in knowing that they have been held accountable.” Sgt. Jason Carrier and Const. Keon Woronuk had their ranks bumped down for one and two years, respectively, after a disciplinary hearing found them guilty of multiple counts of misconduct. Back in 2017, the two on-duty, uniformed officers surreptitiously took photos of then-environment minister Shannon Phillips as she took a meeting at a Lethbridge cafe. Afterwards, Carrier watched her leave the cafe from his vehicle, while Woronuk set up to surveil the cafe, and followed one of the diners — though it’s not clear who — and ran their plates. They both admitted later that they’d been upset about Phillips’s plan to protect nearby wilderness.  The revelations have sent shockwaves to the very top of Alberta’s political leadership, with Premier Jason Kenney calling the incident “deeply disturbing” in a tweet Monday night. The justice minister has directed Alberta’s police watchdog to review the incident, including whether or not there are grounds for a criminal investigation. The incident was only revealed to the public after it was reported on by Chat News Now in Medicine Hat, which obtained a copy of the disciplinary report. That report has not been made public. Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer tweeted that he’d only learned of the incident on Monday night, after news had broke.  In the statement, Woods said, although these matters had been conducted in public hearings — and those notices are posted on the police website — the service is “limited” in what information it can release to the public. “The misconduct and discipline regime under the Police Act and Police Service Regulation incorporates a significant human resources element into the process — it is not purely punitive in nature,” he wrote. “Police Services do not have clear authority to release the full details of discipline hearings and outcomes.” There is a mention of the outcome on the police website that notes two officers had been sanctioned, though it doesn’t include details of the incident or names of the officers involved.  Now that the events have been reported on publicly, Woods said in the statement, he had more leeway to speak about them publicly.  “The actions for which these officers — Sgt. Jason Carrier and Cst. Keon Woronuk — were disciplined cannot be excused. The fact that they admitted to the charges of misconduct indicates that they acknowledge this reality,” he wrote. According to the disciplinary report, both officers did ultimately admit to multiple charges.  However, at their first hearing in September 2019, they entered “deny pleas” to all accounts. According to the agreed statement of facts, Woronuk admits he wasn’t totally forthcoming with police officials about their actions. When Calgary police began investigating, the disciplinary report said, Woronuk told them about a series of internet searches he did that evening to “ascertain the identity of one of the stakeholders,” but didn’t tell them he’d run any plates. He later said that he didn’t mention the plates because he was only responding to Phillips complaint about her photos being posted, though acknowledged that could be seen as “misleading.” Carrier meanwhile, has maintained that he was not involved in any surveillance or traffic enforcement of Phillips, but acknowledged that he did not report Woronuk’s search of the police database to a superior, which was a breach of policy exacerbated by the fact that he was a sergeant in a leadership position.  Wood’s statement goes on to say that Lethbridge police took the initiative in referring the incident for investigation, and it was investigated thoroughly by an outside agency, and outside counsel was retained to “vigorously prosecute” the charges. An “experienced, well-respected retired senior officer from another Services” presided over the hearings.  “The sanctions that were imposed against the officers were, to use the words of the Presiding Officer, ‘significant and on the high end of what may be considered appropriate.’” Woods added that the outcome does not relieve the “embarrassment and shame” that has been brought on Lethbridge police.  It also doesn’t “mitigate the justified anger and profound disappointment of Ms. Phillips and others in our community who have a right to expect so much better from their Police Service.” Woronuk admitted to five counts of misconduct, according to a notice posted to the Lethbridge police website, including using his position to his personal advantage and discrediting the reputation of the police service. He is being demoted two grades to a Constable Level 1 for two years. Carrier was found guilty of two counts, including neglecting his duties as a police officer, and is being demoted one grade to Senior Constable, Level 2, for one year.  Both demotions also mean a temporary reduction in pay."

Whether the federal government will heed that call is the subject of much debate and speculation, even within the ranks of the 67 members of Parliament who signed Tuesday’s letter urging action. The letter calls for Magnitsky legislation to be brought against China’s officials complicit in human rights “atrocities” in Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong. “As a leader on the international human rights discussion, to invoke Magnitsky sanctions against these officials is a strong and symbolic action that is consistent with how Canada has applied this act in the past,” reads the letter.  So-called Magnitsky legislation allows for Canada to impose sanctions, economic or otherwise, against specific people or organizations known to be responsible for human rights violations or corruption in other countries. Liberal MP John McKay pointed to recent actions Canada has taken by Ottawa over the new national security law in China, which include suspending an extradition treaty with Hong Kong and restrictions on certain “sensitive” exports to the region, as examples of a different attitude in Ottawa. “I think it’s an increasing possibility,” he said of sanctions. “I think the progress has been quite rapid in terms of a changing attitude.”  McKay said he thinks speaking out on the China issue has been welcomed by many in his party.  But a fellow signatory, Conservative MP Kenny Chiu, is much less optimistic, arguing Ottawa’s stance on the issue has been weak. “I have seen to date just a bunch of lip service, posturing and I have not seen much of any action,” he said. While he agrees with actions taken regarding Hong Kong after the national security law was brought in, the measures are “defensive” in nature and don’t go far enough, he said.  Chiu said sanctions on Chinese Communist Party officials could affect those with ties to Canada, and prevent them from freely coming to the country or doing business here could have an impact.  The government’s previous action on the issue doesn’t give him much hope sanctions are coming, Chiu said. Last week, Canada’s minister of global affairs, François-Philippe Champagne, suggested Canada was considering such sanctions against some mainland China officials in response to human rights abuses in the country, particularly in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. “Yes, we are considering all the options when it comes to standing up for human rights,” Champagne told the House of Commons in response to questions about whether the government would consider such sanctions. Later in the week, a Reuters story quoted a government source as saying Ottawa was not actually considering the sanctions.  The new calls for human rights sanctions increased recently after paper by academic Adrian Zenz released via the Washington, D.C.-based Jamestown Foundation using Chinese government documents reported forced sterilization was being practised in Xinjiang against its ethnic Uighur population. Such acts are considered genocide according to the United Nations convention addressing such crimes. Meanwhile, critics also say Canada hasn’t taken enough action to support pro-democracy efforts in Hong Kong, which was recently brought further under Beijing’s control with the imposition of a new national security law that opponents say breaches the British-Chinese joint declaration. The declaration is the document laying out the conditions of Hong Kong’s takeover by China, which occurred in 1997; part of it stipulated Hong Kong would enjoy relative autonomy until 2047.  Cherie Wong of the pro-democracy group Alliance Canada Hong Kong, which is a signatory to the letter, said the “inaction” by Ottawa amounts to flip-flopping. “We at Alliance Canada Hong Kong (ACHK) are frustrated with the deliberate inaction,” Wong said in an email. International human rights lawyer David Matas told the Star such sanctions pressure those involved personally in human rights abuses rather than just make a widespread condemnation of a government. “What Magnitsky legislation does is it puts a name and a face to violations,” Matas said. “It’s an attribution of responsibility.”  Such sanctions could include freezing assets, barring those sanctioned from coming to Canada or even opening them up to prosecution should they arrive here, he said.  Last week, the United States named several people and one organization related to human rights abuses in China for sanctions.  Meanwhile, regardless of the likelihood of Canada imposing such sanctions, Chiu and McKay both want to see them introduced. “The question after that is what’s the reaction of the government of China to the naming of individual human rights abusers,” he McKay said. “We’ll see.” "

Provincial police spokeswoman Sgt. Ann Mathieu says officers on the ground and in the air are concentrating on a 50-square-kilometre area around St-Apollinaire, Que., where the bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and six, were located. The girls had last been seen Wednesday and became the subject of an Amber Alert the next day. Police have said they and their father, Martin Carpentier, are believed to have been in a serious crash on Highway 20 in St-Apollinaire on Wednesday evening at about 9:30 p.m. But police say they did not find any occupants inside the car when they arrived on scene. They say they have found “pertinent elements” in the area on Sunday that were sent to a laboratory for analysis to see if they are linked to Carpentier. Police did not specify what the items were, but as the search entered its sixth day, police have raised the possibility Carpentier could be unconscious or dead. Mathieu said it also cannot be ruled out that he remains alive. “You know that someone who is healthy, someone who is mobile, can easily move by walking several kilometres a day,” she told reporters. “We also have to consider that he could have found a means of transport, something as simple as a bicycle.” She said the area being searched was delineated based on reports from the public, and she urged people to remain on the lookout for Carpentier."

Finance Minister Carole James said the numbers are staggering with job losses of 235,000 since February and a predicted GDP decline of 6.8 per cent by the end of this year. “We were preparing for economic moderation, we were well-equipped to be able to weather the challenges,” James said at a news conference Tuesday. “What came next was unprecedented. Mere weeks after Budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed.” The government has provided $6.26 billion in financial aid to businesses and individuals. Among the losses it anticipates this fiscal year because of the pandemic are close to $1 billion in personal income tax, $973 million in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax, James said. The projected GDP decline in 2020 would be the worst on record going back to the 1980s, although it is also projected to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2021. James said for context, B.C.’s real GDP has only declined twice in the past 40 years, falling by 2.4 per cent in 2009 and 6.4 per cent in 1982. “As those numbers remind us, this could be the worst downturn experienced in our province recent history,” she said. B.C.’s restart plan is showing signs of hope for the economy as consumer confidence increases, she said. The unemployment rate is slowly rebounding and fewer wildfires and floods have helped the bottom line. However, she warned that the province’s financial forecast could change depending on many risk factors, including the possibility of a second wave of infections, the possibility of a vaccine, as well as the success of relief measures and central bank policy. Regardless of how B.C. copes with the pandemic, James said its economy is also subject to the economic health of other jurisdictions, particularly those that buy from the province. James said it wouldn’t help the economic recovery to pull back on spending, but the government will review every cent spent as it heads into the next budget year. The B.C. government has tabled legislation giving itself room for three years of deficits, which James said will be re-examined each year. James said she believes people care about provincial deficits because they understand it’s taxpayer money, but they also understand the emergency the pandemic created. She declined to predict how long the recovery would take, given the many moving pieces at play. “There is no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the economy of British Columbia and that’s not short term,” she said. The job losses have been widespread but some have been disproportionately affected, depending on a worker’s age, gender or which sector they work in, James said. Young workers are among the hardest hit, with the unemployment rate rising sharply from 9.1 per cent in February to 29.1 per cent in June for those aged 15 to 24. Women, who dominate the service industries and many of whom have also left jobs to care for family members, are another group more affected. Their unemployment rate rose from 4.8 per cent in February to 13.4 per cent in June. The hardest hit industries include wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services, construction, culture and recreation. The overall unemployment rate of 13 per cent remains at its highest level since 1987. While the job losses in March and April were record breaking, the figures for May and June have seen modest recovery as the economy started to reopen. “The projected numbers are staggering but they’re not without hope. Things are getting better each and every day when we follow the provincial health officer’s advice,” James said. The NDP government’s fiscal update was met with calls for an economic recovery plan by its political opponents, with the Opposition B.C. Liberals asking what happens when federal benefits like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit run out. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson also suggested the government should reconsider its pre-pandemic spending priorities. “People in every corner of B.C. have had to adjust to a new normal and adapt their household budgets, so why is this government pretending it’s business as usual?” he asked in a statement. The Green party said the province should transition to a green economy by helping traditional industries become more sustainable, spending on training and building local businesses into the supply chain. “We can seize the once in a generation opportunity to strategically drive stimulus spending toward a future British Columbians want: an innovative, low-carbon, sustainable, just and inclusive economy for all,” interim leader Adam Olsen said."

It is just the latest twist in Mohamed Mahjoub’s two-decade legal odyssey. The government is trying to remove Mahjoub, 60, using a national security certificate, claiming he was a high-ranking member of a terrorist organization. Security certificates are rarely used federal tools for removing foreign nationals suspected of links to terrorist activity or espionage. Mahjoub, married with three children, came to Canada in 1995 and attained refugee status. He once worked as deputy general manager of a farm project in Sudan run by Osama bin Laden, who would later spearhead the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Mahjoub was arrested under a security certificate in June 2000 after being interviewed by Canada’s spy agency on six occasions between August 1997 and March 1999. Each time, he denied any involvement in extremism. The Supreme Court of Canada struck down the certificate regime as unconstitutional, but the government revamped the process and issued a new certificate against Mahjoub in 2009. It has subsequently been affirmed by the courts. In January, federal officials gave Mahjoub the results of two assessments — one examining the nature and severity of his acts, the other looking at the risks he might face upon removal from Canada. A designated government official will review the assessments in deciding whether Mahjoub should be deported. But before that happens, Mahjoub wants to see all the information underpinning the assessments. Last month the Canada Border Services Agency told Mahjoub and his lawyers it would not disclose “any of the requested documents or provide any further information,” says his recent filing in the Federal Court of Canada. The information is important because, if deported, Mahjoub would be sent to Egypt, “a country where he is likely to face persecution, torture and possible death,” the filing says. The severity of the potential consequences mean Mahjoub is entitled to see “all relevant information,” whether the government intends to rely on it or not, given the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, his submission says. In addition, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms requires the government to disclose any information related to proceedings that have potentially severe effects on Mahjoub’s life, liberty and security, it adds. Mahjoub wants the court to prohibit the immigration minister and his delegate from issuing an opinion on his deportation until the information has been disclosed and he has had a chance to make submissions on it. The government has yet to file a response to Mahjoub’s arguments."

The Ontario Council of Hospital Unions, a division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, says it’s pushing back against the province’s emergency order because it suspends their collective bargaining agreement. Union president Michael Hurley says his members are going to start by sending their MPPs emails this week, explaining how the order damages their workplace rights. The union says it’s also planning legal challenges and will hold rallies outside of its workplaces on Friday. Members of the union will vote on Monday night to see if it will be necessary to have a brief work stoppage the next day. Hurley says that while the emergency orders were acceptable in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s now a detriment to health-care workers and the emergency is over in most of the province. A spokeswoman for the union confirmed on Monday that 98 per cent of its membership voted in favour of political action over the weekend. Hurley says that his members are “angry” and will be holding a series of news conferences in Hamilton, Sudbury, Ottawa and Toronto this week to bring attention to the issues at the community level. The Progressive Conservative government introduced a bill last week that would allow it to keep some emergency measures in place in the months ahead. Hurley said the suspended agreement means hospital staff may have their shifts changed, be moved from site to site, or have vacation requests denied."

Given current COVID-19 trends, the private child-care operators say they can do so safely — and save their centres at the same time. “We need your help to urge the government to allow child-care centres to open safely at full capacity so we can provide child care for parents going back to work and who have nowhere else to turn,” says their website and petition at saveourspaces.ca. “Operating at partial capacity simply isn’t sustainable for the long term, especially with arbitrary direction and little to no financial support from the government. Reopening the economy requires safe and available child care for all.” The group of six female operators, calling themselves Concerned Childcare Providers, say the government’s announcement Monday to boost the “cohort” or grouping numbers to 15 later this month as the province moves into Stage 3 still means fewer spaces for families. “We would like the government to understand that for many the economics of operating child-care facilities at a reduced capacity after months of closures — with little to no financial support from the government — simply does not work, risking the closure and loss of thousands of spaces,” they said. Deborah Renwick opened Ellington Montessori School in Scarborough in 1990, but “when COVID-19 hit, it was unlike anything I had ever experienced in my 30 years of operating this centre.” She had to cover $22,000 in monthly rent, with no parent fees coming in with the shutdown. “Now, I have to close my doors for good,” she said. “I can only hope that others don’t have to resort to this as well.” Leigh Anne Jacques, an owner of Beaches Montessori School, opened the centre three years ago. Shut down because of the pandemic, it just opened up for summer camp, with about 18 students — although capacity is 62. “Since the government has allowed for child-care spaces to open at partial capacity, we decided we had to open our doors — even if it meant at a smaller capacity and at financial loss.… We knew how important it was for parents to have a safe, reliable place to take their kids every day,” she said. In the legislature Tuesday, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath grilled the government about the move to reopen to Stage 3. “Unfortunately, the Conservatives’ refusal to include a province-wide plan for child-care and education is going to make life even harder for workers and business owners in every corner of our province because it’s going to make it next to impossible for working parents to get back to work. Does the premier accept the reality that Ontario won’t be able to get back to work if working moms and dads can’t rely on schools and available child-care spaces?” Education Minister Stephen Lecce said the province will “ensure child care remains sustainable and accessible in every community in this province” and is working closely with the medical officer of health to do so. The NDP also released an emergency plan for back-to-school, which includes “funding to help keep the child-care sector afloat” and using “public infrastructure to support the reopening of schools and daycares” with additional space to allow for physical distancing. Carolyn Ferns, of the Ontario Coalition for Better Child Care, said there are still some questions about the new 15-cohort rule, but said overall the situation “has definitely been a challenge for child-care centres — non-profit and for-profit.” But she said reopening must be guided only by what is best for young children’s health and safety. Many critics have noted that without enough child-care spaces — and even pre-pandemic, there was a shortfall — parents, mostly women, can’t re-enter the workforce. “Women are disproportionately affected by this. It’s not right that a mom should have to pick between having a child and having a job,” said Jacques. Parents, she added, “are looking for more certainty … parents are anxious and our staff are anxious. Part of that is living in a pandemic, and part of it is that we are unable to provide them with a plan.” Every day at Beaches Montessori, kids and staff are screened, including temperature checks, before they are allowed in. “We have worked hard to ensure that our centre is safe. Parents have to wear masks at pickup and drop-off. We have a screener at the entrance wearing PPE and helping us with sanitizing,” said Jacques. “We are working diligently to help support our community. But the time has come that we need some help, too. We can’t sustain operating at a loss forever.”"

Historians estimate that as many as 40,000 people found freedom on the west bank of the Niagara River, escaping from slavery in the American South and fleeing to Canada. Local towns all supported substantial populations of escaped slaves and their families throughout the 19th century. The Freedom Trail is an initiative begun by their descendants who stayed on for generations in the land where they first found freedom. St. Catharines: The Salem Chapel On the fringe of downtown St. Catharines you will find one of the most significant monuments of black history in Canada, the Salem Chapel of the British Methodist Episcopal (BME) Church, built by former slaves and still a thriving hub for the surviving community of their descendants. This is where legendary Underground Railroad conductor Harriet Tubman worshipped during the 1850s and planned the daring raids that brought so many more people north to freedom. “I brought them all clear off to Canada,” she famously declared, and the first stop was always this neighbourhood in St. Catharines. The existing 1853 chapel, the third one the congregation built on this site, is the oldest surviving Black church in Ontario. Niagara-on-the-Lake: Parliament Oak School It was a U.S. bounty hunter snatching back a freed Black woman in Niagara and returning her to slavery that inspired Upper Canada’s first Governor General, John Graves Simcoe, to write his 1793 Act Against Slavery. Simcoe hoped to eliminate slavery in the new colony, but the fact that so many of his colleagues owned slaves forced him to compromise: keeping the existing slaves in chains while banning the creation of more. It was still the first act of its kind in a British colony. You can find a dignified memorial limestone bas-relief on the wall of Parliament Oak School at 325 King Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake, believed to be the site of the colony’s first parliament, where the act was passed. Harriet Tubman’s Historic Crossing into Canada In June 2017 the Niagara Parks Commission unveiled a interpretive plaque commemorating Harriet Tubman’s first crossing into Canada in 1856. She crossed on a suspension bridge near the current Whirlpool Bridge Plaza along the Niagara Parkway north of the falls. Students from nearby schools petitioned for the plaque which details Tubman’s life from her time as a slave in Maryland to her escape to freedom in Canada. Bertie Hall Thirty kilometres south on the Niagara Parkway is the handsome Bertie Hall, an imposing Greek revival mansion that was used as a warehouse for trade goods in the early 19th century — and also as a safe house where newly escaped slaves could hide while U.S. bounty hunters searched for them. A plaque on the grounds details the history of the building and its role in the Underground Railroad. A descent into the basement shows where the runaways hid. The Crossing The Crossing at Fort Erie marks the spot where thousands of fugitives first set foot in Canada. Former Maryland slave Josiah Henson, who escaped in 1830 and became a pioneer community builder in Upper Canada, described how “the riotous exultation” of his feelings upon first landing here caused him to fall to the ground and “to execute sundry antics which excited the astonishment of those who were looking on.” They thought he was suffering from a seizure. But no, Henson explained, it was his first intoxicating experience of freedom that caused his “fit” of happiness. You can find a plaque marking the Crossing in the aptly named Freedom Park at the foot of Bertie Street on the Fort Erie waterfront."

The survey, conducted by Campaign Research for the Star, found that just 13 per cent of those polled thought tuition should remain the same. “I think everybody is looking for a bit of a discount,” said Campaign Research principal Nick Kouvalis. It’s partly a reflection of how people feel about online learning, he said, and “if people think they are not going to get the full experience” of being on campus, spending thousands on tuition doesn’t sit well. A number of student groups have also been pushing for a break on tuition for this fall. Campaign Research polled 1,434 people across Ontario last week, using the Maru Blue opt-in online panel. The equivalent margin of error for a random sample of the same size is plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The survey found the public is split on universities offering in-person classes this fall, with just over one-third supporting the move and 31 per cent opposing it. The remaining third were unsure. However, if classes were smaller, some 67 per cent of respondents feel it would be safe for students to be learning on campus. But when it comes to living on campus, just 27 per cent of those surveyed said it is safe to reopen residences, with 39 per cent saying it’s not. However, if universities only allow for one student per room, 55 per cent agree residences could safely operate this fall. About 50 per cent of respondents felt January 2021 to the best time to reopen residences. Some Ontario colleges and universities are planning for online-only learning this fall, with others promising a hybrid of remote and in-class sessions where possible. Some have closed residences or are planning for one to two students per room depending on the size of the space. Last month, the province announced a summer pilot project allowing post-secondary institutions to partially open their campuses to allow “academically stranded” students to complete lessons or labs they missed during the COVID-19 shutdown. Schools across the province — including all 24 public colleges — are taking part in the pilot, targeted at students studying health care, nursing or the trades, which call for practical, hands-on experience to graduate. Colleges and Universities Minister Ross Romano said the pilot will help guide schools as they plan to reopen safely this fall."

Dasantila Golemi-Kotra, a microbiologist and associate professor at York University, said that for the time being, she’ll continue getting takeout and cook at home. “It seems that the conditions this virus thrives on is in confined areas with proximity to others,” she said. “Bars and restaurants meet all those requirements. We spend time leisurely there, and you find yourself talking louder to compete with the music and other people. Studies have shown that respiratory droplets are released as you talk and the virus persists even in the smallest drops.” The rule laid out by the province so far is that indoor gatherings, such as in restaurants and bars, need at least two metres of space between patrons from different households and social bubbles, unless there’s a barrier like a Plexiglas shield. There’s a maximum indoor gathering limit of 50, guests have to remain seated and buffets are still a no-go. Golemi-Kotra added that respiratory particles can travel beyond six feet within a confined space with poor air circulation, which is why she said patio dining has worked relatively well so far. Alcohol can also make a person more relaxed about social distancing guidelines. Patrons also can’t wear a mask when eating or drinking. Another risk is restrooms. And while the risk of contamination is small, there are surfaces touched by many people and the ventilation isn’t the best.  For those that absolutely must head to a bar or restaurant, Golemi-Kotra still recommends the patio or takeout.  For dining-in, she said to restrict the tables to people from the same household. “If you must dine with your social bubble be strict about it, dine with the people that you share the same health and safety concerns and lifestyle as. Be mindful that asymptomatic people are responsible for as much as 40 per cent of the SARS-CoV-2 spread.”  Keep the dining and drinking sessions short, exercise good hygiene and don’t share food or utensils, she added. Still, even then, she said there’s still a risk of infection as cases have spiked in cities that already reopened bars and restaurants. B.C. health officials issued a warning after eight people who tested positive for COVID-19 had visited downtown Kelowna and the city’s waterfront between June 25 and July 9. Montreal health authorities also told people to get tested after 13 patrons tested positive and visited at least nine bars since July 1. Last month in Michigan, more than 100 COVID-19 cases were traced back to a single bar. On Monday, just after Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced the province’s Stage 3 plans, California’s governor closed all bars and indoor restaurants for a second time as COVID-19 cases continued to rise.  Councillor Joe Cressy, chair of the Toronto Board of Health, told the Star on Monday that the city needs to be “extremely cautious” when it comes to reopening bars in indoor settings and monitor other jurisdictions around the world to see how they’re handling indoor drinking. “I’m happy that the numbers in Ontario are (low) but people tend to forget that we’re doing well because we’re staying home,” Golemi-Kotra said. That’s why we have to be careful or else the numbers will go up again.”"

The Lavazza Drive-In Film Festival, running July 20 to 31, will screen 12 movies from countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic at Ontario Place. It’s a partnership with the Italian Embassy, with a portion of ticket sales donated to the Canadian Red Cross.  It opens with the Toronto debut of Canadian indie film “The Cuban,” starring Oscar winner Louis Gossett Jr., and closes with the Canadian premiere of Italian drama “If Only/Magari.”  Other titles include the U.K. comedy “Fisherman’s Friends”; crime thriller “Sheep Without a Shepherd” from China; Brazilian football dramedy “Back to Maracana”; family-friendly “Spread Your Wings” from France; Second World War movie “T-34” from Russia; Indian comedy “Bala”; “ The Peanut Butter Falcon” from the U.S.; and the Italian movies “Tomorrow’s a New Day,” “If You Love Me” and “I Hate Summer.”  See icff.ca for information.  Lori Loughlin, husband ‘respectfully’ seek bail cut  Lori Loughlin and husband Mossimo Giannulli, who pleaded guilty in the nation’s college admissions scandal, want to get a better deal on their $1 million bail, and federal prosecutors in Boston are OK with it.  The couple are scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 21 on conspiracy charges in their alleged efforts to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California. On Monday in Boston, they filed a motion asking “respectfully” for the court to release their $1-million-US bonds secured by their property, reducing their bail to $100,000, and lift the requirement that the $100,000 bonds also be secured by money or property.  “The Government assents to the relief sought in this motion,” the couple’s team of lawyers wrote in their motion. After asserting their innocence for more than a year, Loughlin and Giannulli reversed course on May 22, formally pleading guilty to one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud, in separate plea agreements with federal prosecutors.  If the couple’s sentences from their deals are accepted by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton, Loughlin will serve two months in prison, pay a fine of $150,000, serve two years of supervised release and undertake 100 hours of community service. Giannulli would serve five months in prison, pay a $250,000 fine and have two years of supervised release with 250 hours of community service.  Tom Bergeron, Erin Andrews exit ‘Dancing With the Stars’ The dance has ended for “Dancing With the Stars” hosts Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews.  ABC said in a statement that the show is looking to “embark on a new creative direction” and host Bergeron “departs the show with our sincerest thanks and gratitude for his trademark wit and charm that helped make this show a success.” No replacements were named; Andrews originally competed as a contestant back in 2010 and returned as co-host in 2014, while Bergeron has hosted since its premiere in 2005.  He took to Twitter to announce his departure. “It’s been an incredible 15-year run and the most unexpected gift of my career,” he wrote. “I’m grateful for that and for the lifelong friendships made.”  Last year, Bergeron made waves when he expressed his unhappiness that former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was among the contestants for the fall season. Bergeron tweeted that he earlier told producers he hoped the new season would be a “joyful respite from our exhausting political climate” and urged them not have any “divisive bookings.”  The network on Monday also said farewell to “Her signature sense of humour has become a hallmark of the show,” the statement read.  Pop Smoke and ‘Hamilton’ Shake Up the Billboard Chart The posthumous debut album by Brooklyn rapper Pop Smoke, who was shot and killed in February, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart this week, arriving as one of the biggest releases of a slow summer in the music business, one of countless industries greatly affected by the coronavirus pandemic.  “Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon,” Pop Smoke’s third career release after two mixtapes, had the largest opening week since Lady Gaga’s “Chromatica” in early June, earning the equivalent of 251,000 albums sold, factoring in both streaming and traditional sales. Songs from the album were streamed 268 million times — the fourth-best streaming week of the year — while bundles of the music and merchandise helped lead to 59,000 units in sales, according to Nielsen.  Pop Smoke, born Bashar Jackson, was killed during a home invasion in the Hollywood Hills section of Los Angeles, interrupting his meteoric mainstream rise from the streets of Canarsie, Brooklyn, New York, where he was at the forefront of the bubbling drill scene. Last week, the Los Angeles Police Department arrested five men in connection with the crime.  In the No. 2 spot this week is the original Broadway cast recording of “Hamilton,” which reached its highest chart placement in its 250th week on Billboard, surging nearly 300% thanks to the July 3 streaming premiere of the filmed version of the show on Disney+. The cast album, released in September 2015, previously peaked at No. 3 on the chart in 2016, following its 11 wins at that year’s Tony Awards. This time, songs from “Hamilton” were streamed 90 million times — a record for cast recordings — and the album sold 32,000 units, for a one-week total of 102,000.  The arrival of Pop Smoke and the resurgence of “Hamilton” bumped rapper Lil Baby’s “My Turn,” which sat at No. 1 for the past four weeks in lieu of major new releases, to No. 3 in its 19th week on the chart. “Blame It on Baby” by DaBaby fell one spot to No. 4, while Post Malone’s “Hollywood’s Bleeding” landed at No. 5.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said there were 111 new cases reported Tuesday morning, with one death. “Locally, 28 of Ontario’s 34 public health units are reporting five or fewer cases, with fully 21 of them reporting no new cases at all,” Elliott said on Twitter. “With 122 more resolved, there are 11 fewer active cases in the province.” There are 137 patients in hospital with COVID-19 with 39 in intensive care units. Of those, 21 are on ventilators. Most of Ontario — excluding the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and parts of the southwest — will enter the third stage Friday, meaning restaurants and bars can serve meals indoors and gyms can reopen as long as physical distancing is maintained. Queen’s Park says 2,723 people have died from the virus since the pandemic struck in March, but the Star has determined there have been 2,761 coronavirus deaths in Ontario. That difference of 38 fatalities is because some were not included were not included early in the outbreak since COVID-19 tests had not been conducted before those people — most of whom were elderly residents of long-term-care homes — died. The government says there have been 36,950 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario. As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, a Star survey of Ontario’s regional health units found a total of 38,966 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19. Over the last week, the province’s 34 health units have reported an average of 127 new infections per day — well down from a sustained peak of nearly 600 cases per day, seen in late April. Tuesday’s 5 p.m. total, up 91 cases in 24 hours, did not include any new reports from Toronto, which has switched to updating just three days a week. The Star’s tally includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, which means they have symptoms, travel history or contacts that indicate they likely have the disease, but haven’t yet received a positive test from a lab."

Adrian Dix said during a news conference Monday that warnings of possible exposures at a restaurant, spin studio, bed and breakfast and resort are believed to stem from “private parties” at the hotels. Eight positive tests for the disease are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city’s waterfront between June 25 and July 9, said an email from Interior Health, the regional health authority. “When people come together for private parties — in this case it was primarily people in their 20s and 30s — the risks are considerably higher,” Dix said. The exposures follow the move to a new phase of reopening in B.C. that allows for tourism within the province. Although the accommodation industry was not ordered to close during the pandemic, many operators did so voluntarily but began welcoming guests again as part of the new phase. Infections in B.C. inched up on Monday as health officials announced 62 new cases since Friday. Two more people also died for a total of 189 deaths in B.C. The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 3,115, while 2,718 people have fully recovered from COVID-19. Interior Health also issued an isolation order for Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver after two positive tests associated with the farm. Public health officials are monitoring the situation and placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm, the government said in a news release. The cases linked to Kelowna involved people who live in three regions of the province, including the Interior, Fraser and Vancouver Coastal Health regions, said Dix. He credited contact tracers with making the connections. He said the tourism industry has done a good job of creating safe environments for guests, but it’s also up to guests to ensure they respect physical distancing guidelines and group size limitations. “Whether it’s a trip or a party at home, the same risks and the same rules apply,” Dix said. If you’re gathering with friends and family, you should consider the increased risk that indoor locations pose and determine how many people can maintain a safe distance accordingly, he said. “We have got to live with COVID-19 for the next year so that means the responsibility is on all of us to understand the risks and understand our responsibilities to one another.” Interior Health issued an exposure advisory for the resort and bed and breakfast on Friday and added the restaurant and spin studio in a statement on Sunday. Visitors to the Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 or the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to July 5 were advised to self-isolate and monitor themselves closely for symptoms. The health authority is now urging visitors to Kelowna’s Cactus Club restaurant on Water Street between July 3 and July 6, or the Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 to self-monitor and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms appear. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control also warns that a case or cases were confirmed on an Air Canada flight from Kelowna to Vancouver on July 6, but Dix could not say if that warning was linked. Public health contact tracing is underway and the health authority said it’s reaching out directly to anyone who has been exposed, where possible. Testing is recommended for anyone with novel coronavirus symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or a loss of taste or smell, said Interior Health. “Milder symptoms may include runny nose, fatigue, body aches ... diarrhea, headache, sore throat, vomiting and red eyes,” it said in a statement. Anyone with even mild symptoms is urged to stay home and avoid travel. Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 include physical distancing, regular hand washing, not touching the face and avoiding gatherings of more than 50 people, the health authority said."

Indigenous groups share impact of border closures,['Nick WellsThe Canadian Press'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","Indigenous bands along the west coast of British Columbia say their borders will remain closed to tourists and non-residents, despite the economic impact, as they work to raise awareness about the threat COVID-19 poses to their communities. The Nuu-chah-nulth, the Heiltsuk Nation and the Haida Nation have all closed or restricted access to their territories and reserves. “Of course it’s negatively impacting. But our directors have said, our chiefs have said, people before economics,” said Judith Sayers, the president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, in an interview. “I think everyone is slowly realizing the impact economically, but right now we just really feel that we want to protect the members first.” Members of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, made up of 14 First Nations along the west coast of Vancouver Island, have deployed a variety of tactics to help ensure their borders are kept sealed from non-residents. Members of the Ahousaht First Nation, who live in the remote area of Flores Island, have deputized citizens to act as peacekeeping officers, Sayers said. The Ahousaht issued a notice on July 2 that their territory, which covers a large area of land and water north of Tofino, B.C., including provincial parks, will remain closed to tourists and non-residents as there “is still no vaccine, no antiserum and no cure for COVID-19.” Others, like the Tla-o-qui-aht in Tofino, stopped cars in an effort to convince them to turn around. The concern, Sayers says, lies in the ability to test and contain any potential COVID-19 outbreak. “A lot of our communities are remote and testing is not easily available,” she said. “If you’re in Port Alberni, or Nanaimo, or Victoria, or somewhere (else), you can get testing and get results in 24 hours. It’s not the same with our communities.” The closures have resulted in disputes between Indigenous groups and local businesses. The Haida Nation in Haida Gwaii have turned away non-residents at the ferry terminal, discouraged leisure travel and called on two local fishing lodges to rethink their reopening plans. “We’re such a close-knit community, I think that once we get a case of COVID, I think that it’ll spread like wildfire,” said Duffy Edgars, the Chief Councillor of the Old Massett Village Council in Haida Gwaii. Edgars said many local fishing lodges are respecting the Haida Nation’s state of emergency, but is frustrated by others who want to open up. “It’s disrespectful,” he said. “These bigger (lodges) are coming in and just doing whatever they want.” Leaders and representatives from the Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk and Haida all say they would like to see more co-operation from the provincial government in working with Indigenous communities. “It’s really frustrating,” said Marilyn Slett, the chief councillor of the Heiltsuk. “We have a limited amount of time here, we think, before that anticipated second or third wave so right now is the time for us to be sitting down and having those discussions so going forward we’re all working collaboratively together.” Part of the issue, she says, lies in B.C. politicians encouraging residents to take part in interprovincial tourism. “We’re seeing a lot more vessel traffic on the coast, we’re seeing a lot more recreational boaters, and that’s a really high concern for our community,” said Slett. The closures — many of which began in March — have been felt at a variety of levels. The pandemic forced the cancellation of the Heiltsuk’s Spawn-on-Kelp fishery this year, an event Slett says employs 700 people and is a hugely important economic driver for the community. “Certainly our community put forward the health and safety before the economic driver,” she said. “So our community has been hit hard.” Sayers says when the pandemic first broke out and restrictions were placed on communities, First Nations were bringing in food for members so they didn’t have to leave their reserves and face possible exposure at grocery stores. The Heiltsuk, Nuu-chah-Nulth and the Tsilhqot’in issued a statement in late June, criticizing the provincial government’s reopening plan and what they saw as a lack of dialogue with First Nations groups. All three want the province to commit to four conditions which would allow border restrictions being lifted: COVID-19 information sharing, screening, rapid testing and culturally-safe contract tracing teams. Until those are met, Slett says, she can’t see Indigenous communities fully opening their borders. But the provincial government says it is committed to working with Indigenous communities. “Many tourist-depending communities are now safely welcoming the gradual return of out-of-town visitors,” said Sarah Plank, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “At the same time, we acknowledge some smaller and more remote communities and First Nations continue to be concerned about visitors to their communities.” The government is also working on scheduling a meeting with the Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsilquot’in, Heiltsuk and Haida Nations and other communities, she added."

The world chipped in,"['Rochelle Baker , National Observer']","Sun., July 12, 2020","It’s a thoroughly unromantic name. Lot 302. Yet the 20-acre parcel of timber symbolizes the achievement and ongoing battle by a tiny coastal community to protect as much mature forest as they can on their remote B.C. island. “We just couldn’t bear to see yet another clearcut,” said Read Island resident Lannie Keller of the Surge Narrows community, which managed to raise $150,000 inside of four months to protect 20 acres of forest earlier this year. And the community is working to buy another parcel with an important riparian zone to complement their recent acquisition and further protect Read Island’s ecologically sensitive areas. This time, it’s a spot where the forest intersects with streams and swampy areas critical to salmon and amphibian habitat. “There is a remaining 128 acres of wetland and mature trees in the middle of the island, which would extend our protected area in a lovely and significant way,” said Lannie, who along with husband Ralph, sparked the community’s most recent efforts to conserve their forests. Approximately 80 residents live full time on Read Island — one of several “outer islands” wedged between Vancouver Island and the B.C. coast in the northern reaches of the Straight of Georgia — which is only accessible by boat or float plane. And the community of Surge Narrows — which boasts not much more than a public dock, a small post office, a small school, a community hall, and an abandoned, ramshackle clapboard store — is tucked into Read Island’s northwest flank. Despite its small size, Surge Narrows acts as a community hub for Read Island, as well as for residents of surrounding Maurelle, North and South Rendezvous, and Sonora islands. So when nearby Lot 302 went up for sale last summer, and the Kellers heard the mixed mature forest was drawing the interest of a logging company, the couple knew they had to act fast. “It was a beautiful piece of treed land along the main road where people travel to get mail, to the school or the dock,” Lannie said. The parcel was also adjacent to the island’s John Kim Ecological Sanctuary and would create a green corridor from the Surge Narrows dock to the boundary of the island’s existing Fish and Forest Reserve at the headwaters of two important salmon streams, Ralph added. “We thought, ‘Oh man, we better do something right now,’ so we went back and wrote them a cheque,” Lannie said. Lot 302’s owners, long-term residents, were willing to sell the land to the community at a reduced price. So the Kellers, through their local kayaking business, Coast Mountain Expeditions, offered a $50,000 down payment and guaranteed the entire $150,000 purchase price if the community decided not to come on board. But the community was all in. The Kellers presented the idea to the Surge Narrows Community Association (SNCA), representing about 130 permanent residents on the surrounding isles. “The response was super enthusiastic,” said Lannie, who wasn’t surprised by the tight-knit community’s response, but rather by the speed at which the remaining funds were raised. “We were astounded. It just happened so fast,” Lannie said, adding the community, which doesn’t have deep pockets, gave generously. “Sometimes it was to the point where we said, ‘You can’t do that. You don’t have that much to give,’” said Lannie, noting one resident was donating half her limited pension to the project. But what really shocked the community was the response from the outside world, the Kellers said. “The funding came from near and far,” said Lannie, adding people donated from across Canada and even internationally. “Some had distant links to Read Island, but some had absolutely no connection at all but said (forest conservation) resonated with them.” Protecting remaining intact forests strikes a deep chord with people around the globe, Ralph said. “Most people today love living forests. The wilderness and the feeling they exude,” he said. “As soon as you clear-cut it, lay it all to waste and destroy the wildlife habitat, nesting sites and the wetlands, it threatens us personally. Whether it’s British Columbia or Brazil, a clearcut has become the international symbol of the destruction of the environment.” Read Island, like most of British Columbia, has a long, history with clearcut logging, Ralph added, noting the practice is ongoing on the island’s woodlots. In the mid-1980s, just a couple of years after the couple arrived on the island, 1,200 acres of mature low-elevation rainforest was razed to the ground, he said. “To be able look across the island for several kilometres and not see a single tree was pretty impactful for all of us,” Ralph said. It led to the community working together for the first time in 1992 to purchase a lot from Raven Forest Products to create the island’s first reserve to try to protect the salmon streams. But in that instance, the effort took three years to raise $78,000 for the 20-acre lot, Lannie said, adding people had relatives’ kids knocking on doors in Vancouver for spare change. “We were exhausted afterwards,” she said. But this last time around, an international conservation organization arrived on Read in February to explore whether it would back the purchase of Lot 302, only to find the fundraising was already done, Lannie said. Now, the Germany-based Wilderness International is partnering with the Surge Narrows community to provide the bulk of the funds to try to purchase the wetland Lot 309, Ralph said. Wilderness International has promised $150,000 to help the SNCA purchase the lot, said David MacDonald, Canadian director with the organization. “We’re waiting on the decision of the landowner, after which we’ll draw up a co-operative agreement,” he said. Wilderness International purchases private lands with intact rainforest to protect biodiversity and capture carbon dioxide to prevent climate change, he said. German society is passionate about protecting the world’s forests because they have so little of their own wilderness left, MacDonald added. Aside from occasional visits from biologists or student groups to study the ecosystems at their sites, not much else will happen other than the foundation paying taxes in perpetuity, he said. “Essentially, the concept is: We buy the forests and leave them alone.” The Kellers said the Surge Narrows community is also waiting to hear from the landowner to move forward. “We’re all waiting with bated breath,” Lannie said. With the experience gained through their kayaking company, they know the wilderness on and around Read Island is precious, the Kellers said. “This environment is so incredible, and we’ve had thousands of people visit from all over the world over the years. And they’ve said they’ve never been anywhere so beautiful,” Lannie said. “It’s special, and it deserves protection.”"

In the aftermath of a deal being struck to resume the NHL season Aug. 1, Green, Polak and three other players joined Calgary defenceman Travis Hamonic in choosing not to participate in the expanded 24-team playoffs. “Due to the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 and after much consideration, I’ve decided for deeply personal family health reasons not to participate in the return to play,” Green said in a statement. After a trade from Detroit, the defenceman played two games for Edmonton before injuring his right knee. Boston’s Steven Kampfer, Montreal’s Karl Alzner and Vancouver’s Sven Baertschi also decided to opt out. Kampfer, who played 10 games with the Bruins this season, said his wife and son have a congenital defect that could cause complications with the virus and called it “one of the hardest decisions” he has had to make. Polak is a pending free agent who last month agreed to a deal in his native Czech Republic next season and told reporters there he wasn’t planning on returning to the NHL if play resumed. Baertschi, who spent most of this season in the minors, is under contract through 2020-21. “Sven informed us late yesterday that he has chosen to opt out of the NHL return to play program,” Canucks general manager Jim Benning said. “It was a difficult decision but ultimately one we respect and understand.” Hamonic became the first player to publicly choose not to play in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Hamonic’s daughter was hospitalized last year with respiratory issues, and he and his wife also have a baby boy. Their health concerns, not the soon-to-be 30-year-old’s impending free agency, led him to opt out. “I wish I could lace up my skates and be out there battling, blocking a shot and helping my team win, but my family has and always will come first,” Hamonic said. “Being my little kids’ dad every day is the most important job I have. I love this game and my team. This is a decision that is extremely hard for me to make.” The Lightning already got a pandemic scare when three players and additional staff tested positive for the novel coronavirus last month. The positive test results forced the team to close its facilities for a brief period of time. The Minnesota Wild, who face the Canucks in the qualifying round, ruled out defenceman Greg Pateryn indefinitely with an upper-body injury. NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said Saturday the league will be taking over injury and illness disclosure from teams as a way of protecting player privacy. “Medical privacy is important in this process,” Daly said. “Having said that, we understand as a league we have an obligation of some transparency with respect to the COVID virus in particular, so at least for now we’re going to maintain a policy where the league is announcing on basically league numbers and clubs are really prohibited from giving any information with respect to COVID test results, and, for purposes of making the system work, any injury information going forward.”"

Messy, gassy, and unapologetically, I take up space, much like a full-grown Saint Bernard, in my parents’ parallel universe. Sadly, the pandemic has reduced this broke-ass millennial into a drooling state of oversized adolescence. After living in a luxury granite box with six roommates (two of them were front-line workers), and surviving a turtle-slow recovery from COVID-19 symptoms, I found myself moving residences again in May 2020.  At 11 a.m., ravenous, I amble into my parents’ basement for breakfast. I count seven family-sized bags of yam tortilla chips, thirty-two cans of cream of mushroom soup, two forty-pound bags of jasmine rice, and seven bottles of blue dishwashing liquid. Name it, and we most likely have it, buried under the bulk bird seed on Shelf 8. “Told you to always stock up for emergencies,” my mother announces. I roll my eyes, but I help her set a trap for our ongoing rodent problem. Diaspora, like heart-exploding grief, OCD, and excessive ambition, has both wrecked and strengthened our family. My Chinese family belongs to a particular sect of professional hoarders, and this current pandemic has only validated their lifestyle. Like many once impoverished immigrants, we have been preparing — AKA paranoid — for multiple global disasters long before COVID-19 happened. I once used to scoff at this gratuitous habit of radical saving and stockpiling on repeat, but it makes sense to me now.  For as long as I can remember, my parents have resisted the preternatural tug of the homeland. It wasn’t until March 2019 that the siren call, like severe tinnitus, became impossible to ignore. Off to Hong Kong we embarked, a place of once vicious famine and long-squashed dreams. It would be my first time in Asia, and I couldn’t bear to turn down a complimentary trip. Upon leaving Hong Kong International Airport, as if by sorcery, the humidity freshened my sandpaper skin, and volumized my iron-flat Vancouverite hair. It was as if the city was welcoming it’s long lost, weirdo daughter with a makeover. Our week was a flurry of show and tell and, one day, we went to my parents’ respective villages. We took the MTR from Mong Kok, bussed on public transit, rode a train, which was followed by multiple taxi rides to the slums. It took 4.5 hours to get there. Finally, my mother, almost shyly, showed us her childhood home-school, built on top of a creepy open-hole graveyard, and talked about how she would play with the jutting bones of corpses as a child. The grotesque trees, arthritic-looking and uncared for, made me so sad I felt everything turn to decay inside me. “No wonder you’re so messed up,” I blurted, and instantly regretted it. “You’re the one who’s messed up,” she retorted in Cantonese. “Can’t do math, complains all the time about stomach aches-” “No,” I said, shivering despite the heat. “I mean, this is why you are so scared of ghosts and starving to death.” “Um, yeah,” she said, smacking me on the back of my head. I groaned. But then she sighed, eyebrows furrowing together. She glanced around, no longer a simple tourist, as if really looking for the first time, seemingly sorrowful at the dilapidated graves scattered around us. Did she regret coming back? However she felt, for the first time I understood her fear of scarcity, this ancient inherited trauma. After all, I felt diaspora was best suited for gamblers, entrepreneurs, great white sharks, and hopeless optimists. For the rest of us, mediocres and sentimentalists, when you involuntarily hop country and home, you accumulate a Tantalus gluttony, and you fill the physical void with pragmatic things that can be eaten, bartered or saved. POC, especially impoverished ones like my mother, understand that shit inevitably happens, and it’s best to be prepared. Nice housing is only provisional. “We’re never coming back,” my mother finally pronounced, and we followed her, like a congregation of fruit flies — far away from her private destitution to our four-star hotel, our temporary home in Asia. As for me, I didn’t mind Hong Kong at all. In fact, it felt like I had almost never left Vancouver. Everyone looked exactly like me, neither worse nor better. For the remaining trip, we ate and shopped like the middle-class we aspired to be, as if we were badass rice-eaters on vacation instead of scared immigrants on their homecoming. I arrived back in Canada with fifteen cheap polyester dresses, all beaded, lacy and ridiculous, and I decided I was ready for any literary event, Comic-Con or Halloween. It only fazed me a little that being a size 2 in North America meant that I was XXXL in Asia. In my eccentric, complicated glory, I realized that I’d become capitalism’s bitch and my mother’s daughter: more is better and surplus is safer.  In my parents’ world, though, it often feels like I’m tumbling backwards when my peers are levelling up with adulting in the guise of matrimony, mortgages, babies, promotions. I tell myself when the pandemic is over, surely I’ll move into the RV parked on the driveway or perhaps a distant relation (that I don’t know of) will die, leaving me money and allowing me to purchase a sea vessel. Wouldn’t it be super-fun to live on a houseboat? I think excitedly. You could throw your roommates, friends, lovers, and family members overboard whenever they were too loud or obnoxious. COVID-19 may be my generation’s diaspora, but it’s also my family’s latest, haunting trauma. At my parents’ dwelling, I have a recurring high-stress nightmare where I am trying to frantic-pack a wheelie suitcase because the building is supposed to explode in two minutes. Panicked, I hurl clothing into a never ending black hole of fabric. Fed up, I zip up the case, but it expands like an inflatable balloon. Screeching, I beseech the suitcase to rescale to a normal size. Action-heroine I am not, and the suitcase knows this. Eventually, it grows so unwieldy and wide that it doesn’t fit through the door frame, but I’m relentless and determined enough to save all my belongings, even though I know I’m doomed. Then, as the building ignites, special effects inferno-BOOM!, homegirl wakes up-all lock-jawed, sweat-stinky, and terrified. It is a shame to lose all my things! I growl, and regretful I am in this waking life, and so I wonder where I had purchased the defective suitcase. Who do I blame, really, but myself? Anything, at any moment in flight, might turn out to be unbearable, might transform into a sign of absurdity that one might never escape."

Sgt. Jason Carrier and Const. Keon Woronuk have been temporarily demoted after a disciplinary hearing found each of them guilty of multiple counts of misconduct.  The 2017 incident — reported on by Chat News Today on Monday — apparently stemmed from the officers’ opposition to the minister’s bid to protect more local land. The disciplinary decision said the two men were upset because Shannon Phillips, who was then the environment minister, was pushing to turn swaths of the nearby Castle Wilderness area into a park that would not allow ATV use. “Sgt. Carrier did not agree with the plan Minister Phillips was outlining as he, and others he knew, enjoyed outdoor activities in the Castle area and opposed potential restrictions,” according to the agreed statement of facts. According to the statement, Carrier recognized Phillips when she arrived at the Chef Stella Diner on the morning of April 14, 2017. He was already there with two other on-duty and uniformed officers, both junior in rank, when Phillips sat down at the next table. He said he overheard Phillips discussing her plans for the Castle Wilderness area, though, speaking to media Monday, the MLA disputed this, and said she was actually discussing the reintroduction of bison to Banff National Park.  Carrier took a photo of the meeting and texted it to Woronuk, and “invited him to attend.” The agreed statement of facts notes that the two were friends and both liked to camp and fish in the Castle, a range of wilderness on the eastern slopes of the Rockies. When he arrived, Woronuk also took a photo of the group, the report said. While he was paying, Carrier took a selfie of himself with the minister in the background. Outside the diner, the report quotes Woronuk as having said he “would hate to see Phillips drive away from the restaurant and there was a reason to stop her.” Carrier replied that she should receive the same treatment as anyone else “such as a soccer mom speeding through a playground,” according to the report, and that politicians shouldn’t get special treatment. With that, both officers went to their vehicles. Carrier drove to a parkade to do reports and monitor activity because it was “known for prostitution-related activities,” according to the agreed-upon facts. From inside his vehicle, he noticed Phillips leave the diner and walk away before noon. Woronuk, meanwhile, had set up to surveil the diner, and watched one of the diners — the report doesn’t specify who — leave, then followed the vehicle for five blocks before losing it at a red light. He drove a few more blocks but couldn’t find the vehicle again.  Woronuk also ran the licence plate through the central police database despite being motivated by “personal and political views,” as opposed to concerns for public safety, the decision said.  Carrier has maintained that he was not involved in the official surveillance or traffic enforcement of Phillips or the other diners, the decision says. Phillips said she believes she was tailed by a police officer that day. Phillips, who’d previously reported the photos to police, called the whole incident “very disturbing.” “If officers in this town are going to place someone under surveillance, because they don't agree with them, what does that mean for overall community safety?” On Twitter on Monday evening, Alberta Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer said he’d learned of the events that night, and shared in the “outrage” being expressed. “To say it is completely unacceptable that members of the police would conduct unauthorized surveillance of any Albertan — in particular an elected official — is an understatement,” he posted. He said that the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team, the province’s police watchdog, had been ordered to conduct a review to determine if there are grounds for a criminal investigation. He added that he’d instructed his department to arrange for an out-of-province prosecutor should ASIRT require legal advice. The events came to light after Phillips filed a complaint in 2017 under the Police Act after learning that photos of her at the diner had been posted to Facebook. This sparked an investigation by the Calgary Police Service. According to a notice posted to the Lethbridge police website, Woronuk admitted five counts of misconduct, including using his position to his personal advantage and discrediting the reputation of the police service. He is being demoted two grades to a Constable level 1 for two years. Carrier was found guilty of two counts, including neglecting his duties as a police officer, and is being demoted one grade to Senior Constable, Level 2, for one year. "

Obviously those emotions are still fresh,” team captain Connor McDavid told reporters on a Zoom call after practice at Rogers Place. “It makes it even more real now that we’re all together and he’s not able to join us. “He’s obviously going to be in our thoughts and in our hearts as we go forward.” Cave, from Battleford, Sask., died April 11 in a Toronto hospital while in a medically induced coma following surgery to remove a colloid cyst that was causing pressure on his brain. He played 67 career NHL games for the Boston Bruins and the Edmonton Oilers. The centre was called up for 11 games by the Oilers last season. When the Oilers skated out before for their first official return to play practice, the scoreboard above centre ice displayed a picture of Cave in his orange Oiler uniform high-fiving fans beside the message “We Skate for Colby.” Head coach Dave Tippett said the team held a meeting about Cave’s death prior to practice. “Colby was an unbelievable young man, great teammate. Obviously a friend to everybody in our locker room,” said Tippett. “He would be with us today if he hadn’t passed. He planned to be with our group (for the upcoming Stanley Cup tournament). “He’s with us in spirit.” The COVID-19 virus kept Cave’s wife Emily from his bedside and continues to cast a long shadow over the NHL as it prepares to finish the season with 24 teams playing in isolation in two hub cities: Edmonton and Toronto. Players are allowed to opt out without sanction. Oiler defenceman Mike Green has already announced he will sit out, citing personal family health reasons. Asked about it, Tippett said, “(The decision) didn’t catch me off guard. “(Green) was really struggling with the decision, but he decided that for personal reasons with his family it was the best situation for him, and you have to respect that. “This is unprecedented times. You’ve got to allow for flexibility.” The first day of camp saw Ryan Nugent-Hopkins playing on a wing with Connor McDavid and Zack Kassian. The Oilers open the best-of-five qualifying round Aug. 1 vs. the Chicago Blackhawks. Their fortunes will rise or fall with McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, who was crowned the regular season scoring champ after the season was suspended March 12, around the 70-game mark. Nugent-Hopkins said while on hiatus he used some weights from his brother, did some roller blading and then began skating once the smaller rinks opened up in British Columbia. The tournament will be a whirlwind, sometimes with three games a day in each of the hub cities with no fans cheering them on. Nugent-Hopkins said there won’t be any home ice advantage. “We know it’s going to be intense,” he said. “There’s going to be a lot of energy. Without the fans we’ll have to find ways to create our own energy.” Kassian said the practices are critical because there is very little runway before the games resume. “There’s no team that’s ahead of any other team in this thing. Whoever comes in and whoever competes the hardest, whoever gets off on the right foot is going to have the most success, especially in these best-of-five series,” he said."

Can anyone imagine a team being called the Washington Blackskins? Or the Whiteskins? Of course not. But at least the team has finally decided to sideline the name and get a new one. That brings us to the Edmonton Eskimos, one of Canada’s legendary football teams. Does its name also reek of racist colonialism? Or is it just a tongue-in-cheek alliterative reminder of Edmonton’s long, dark winters? As racial issues burst forth in the U.S. and here in Canada too, as statues of Christopher Columbus come tumbling down, and cities such as Columbus, Ohio consider changing their names, it’s becoming obvious that names we took for granted are more than just names — they have history and meaning too.  And for some people those names are also a reminder, perhaps even a glorification, of the way they were mistreated by colonial authorities, missionaries, and European settlers.  Take the word Eskimo, for example. According to the Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, although Eskimo was a commonly used word it is now considered unacceptable because it was imposed on Indigenous people by colonial authorities.  For Norma Dunning, an Inuk professor at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, the team name is definitely racist and should be changed because it is an insult to the smallest group of Indigenous people in Canada — the Inuit.  “I’m often told that it’s only football and the name is harmless. Harmless to whom? Harmless to the future generations of Inuit children who will grow up hearing that word — that one word, “Eskimos” — and be conditioned into believing that it’s OK?” she wrote recently. One of the team’s sponsors — Belair Direct, a home and car insurance company — has also urged the team to change its name.  That seemed to get the attention of team executives, who hastily announced they would conduct another review of the name issue. They have already canvassed Inuit people to see what they thought of the name and concluded there was no consensus on whether it should be changed. That alone indicates that a lot of the Inuk surveyed don’t like the name. Perhaps a majority since consensus implies total agreement. In any event the name remained. Whether another review will come up with a different response from the team remains to be seen.  Speaking of colonial authorities, it’s interesting to look around and see how many Canadian towns and cities are named in true colonial style after British royalty — Victoria, Prince Rupert, Prince George, Prince Albert. There’s even a province — Prince Edward Island.  And perhaps the most colonial name of all is British Columbia.  The Columbia part is named after our friend Christopher Columbus and once designated the entire northwest coastal territories. But when the British took over the northern part of Columbia it was renamed British Columbia.  Alberta is not far behind. It was named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta, Queen Victoria’s fourth daughter and wife of Canada’s Governor-General. I guess we should be thankful the province wasn’t simply dubbed Albert after Queen Victoria’s consort.  Is it this yearning for colonial times that prompted some conservative types, including Alberta premier Jason Kenney, to refer to Canada Day as Dominion Day?  Names can be changed. The Queen Charlotte Islands named after the Queen consort of King George III were renamed Haida Gwaii by the people who actually live there.  And we certainly have lots of other examples of Indigenous names — Kelowna, Nanaimo, Yukon, Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Manitoba, Winnipeg, Toronto, Niagara, and Quebec — that distinguish Canada as a place with Indigenous origins.  One of my favourites is Skookumchuk, a Chinook name for three places in B.C. that means “strong tide, strong ocean current, rapids.” In this day and age would we be comfortable with a team named the Calgary Indians? Or the Toronto Half Breeds? Those words were once part of common language but they are now considered insulting. And for the Inuit it surely must feel humiliating to see a name that is considered an insult bandied about on team jerseys and mugs not to mention hours and hours of televised CFL games.  Face it Edmonton, it’s time to change the name of your football team. "

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada. In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district. But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he’ll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends. That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won’t be able to resist going out. “Once it becomes the ‘real playoffs’ I think more and more the momentum will grab,” he said. Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely. Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas. “You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you’re doing it in a safe manner,” said Black. The players themselves aren’t to have any contact with the general public. Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto’s associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often. An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn’t be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes. Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city’s civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday. “The City of Edmonton’s first priority is public safety and we’ll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,” Grimble said. Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when — not if — his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing. “We have to get through this together or else it’s not going to change,” said McLeod. But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn’t have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer. “It’s daylight ‘til 11 o’clock. You don’t want to spend half your day watching hockey,” Merhej explained. “I’d rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.”"

The omission is revealed in a series of emails between the two governments obtained by The Canadian Press. “We have been made aware ... that the Alberta Energy Regulator has indefinitely suspended several environmental monitoring requirements for major oilsands producers,” wrote Erin Kelly, the N.W.T.’s deputy environment minister to her Alberta counterpart. “Do you have any information that can be shared about this?” The May 15 email was written more than a week after Alberta’s regulator suspended a wide array of monitoring over what it said were public-health concerns raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. Kelly said her government learned about the move from news reports. Ten days later, Kelly had not received a response. “This is concerning to many N.W.T. residents, who still maintain subsistence lifestyles,” she wrote May 25. “With COVID-19 we have even more residents relying on food harvested from the land and it is almost certain that concerns related to reduced monitoring upstream will be brought up during (the upcoming legislative) session.” Monitoring is expected to resume Wednesday. The N.W.T. is downstream from the oilsands and in 2015 signed an agreement with Alberta that spelled out clear responsibilities on information-sharing, notification and consultation for cross-boundary waters. In her second email, Kelly points to that deal. “The (territory) has not been informed of or discussed new changes to monitoring as per (the agreement). I have yet to receive a response to my last email.” An Alberta Environment and Parks email shows Kelly’s second note provoked an “urgent” request within the department for a response to her concerns. In answer to a request for an explanation for the lack of consultation, Alberta’s United Conservative government provided a one-sentence email. “There have been ongoing discussions and information-sharing with the N.W.T. on the status of ambient water quality monitoring at sites referenced in the Alberta-N.W.T. Bilateral Agreement throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in March,” wrote Alberta Environment spokesman John Muir. Joslyn Oosenbrug, spokeswoman for the N.W.T. Environment Department, said several meetings were held in June to address the territory’s concerns. “Alberta has committed to sharing information and discussing any changes to monitoring,” she wrote in an email. “Communication is ongoing, and includes emails and letters exchanged at the deputy minister and ministerial level.” However, the territory wants a stronger voice in managing water flowing into its land. It wants a seat on several committees that determine how waters will be monitored “to ensure downstream interests are represented,” Oosenbrug wrote. Marlin Schmidt, environment critic for Alberta’s Opposition New Democrats, said the snub showed a “lack of respect.” “It’s really disappointing to me to see the government of Alberta is taking its relationship with other Canadians so lightly right now,” he said. “When our government is complaining about the poor treatment that we’re allegedly getting from other Canadians, we should be treating (them) with the respect with which we expect to be treated.” The N.W.T. isn’t the only interested group that wasn’t consulted about the suspensions. First Nations in the oilsands area, environmental groups, Alberta’s chief scientist and the scientific consultants who perform monitoring work all say they were left out of the decision. The government has said the move was made in response to concerns from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers about operators not being able to meet certain monitoring requirements while complying with COVID-19 orders. Alberta has yet to release work plans or budget for this year’s field season of a joint federal-provincial program responsible for environmental monitoring outside various oilsands leases. Industry, which funds the efforts, has been lobbying heavily for a less extensive and cheaper plan."

The siblings have been separated for more than 20 years. Gele and Abdille, along with their parents, moved to the Daadab refugee complex in Kenya after fleeing their war-torn homeland, Somalia, in 1991. Gele eventually came to Halifax in 1997, but her family stayed behind. While she’s thought about her family members often throughout her time in Nova Scotia, the past few months have been especially difficult and their catch-up WhatsApp calls have become less and less lighthearted, according to Gele. Abdille’s asthma has become more threatening over the last two years, and with COVID-19 preventing puffers and medication from flowing to the Daadab refugee complex, Gele said she worries that her brother, too, will fall victim to the chronic disease. Asthma runs in their family and it claimed the lives of their aunt and grandfather. “Every morning I talk to them to see how he’s doing. Some days he’s OK, some days he’s getting worse, sometimes it’s really scary,” said Gele. “The situation is very, very hard now. Every night, my brother thinks (whether) he will die now or not. When he’s home and he’s sitting, really he cannot even breathe.” Abdille’s 14-year-old daughter Nasteeh, who similarly suffers from asthma, has also been on Gele’s mind lately. Gele said the father and daughter have hardly stepped foot outside in the last four months during the COVID-19 pandemic, given their immuno compromised state. United We Win Halifax, a private sponsorship group that met Gele through her translation and settlement support services for newcomers in Nova Scotia, has launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to sponsor and bring Abdille, his wife and seven of their children who are under 18, to Halifax. “We were really struck partly by how much Nasra was doing in the community, but also trying to support her brother (in Kenya), sending money to him to buy food and medication,” said Dave Aalders, a member of United We Win Halifax. Aalders said Gele told him about the asthma attacks her brother would have where he “didn’t know (if) he was going to live” and the limited health care and access to medication at the refugee complex. That prompted the group to lend a hand. “We want to be able to help,” he said. “And also the fact that (Abdille) has been (at the refugee camp) since the early ‘90s and the world sort of tends to forget about some refugees, that bothered us as well, that there are folks that have been there for that long and haven’t had a chance to get out.” The group’s GoFundMe fundraising goal is $10,000, but that will only cover a portion of the $30,000 that is required to bring a refugee family the size of the Abdille family to Canada and support them for one year, according to Aalders. They have also set up accounts with some bottle depots in Halifax, allowing community members to exchange their bottles and have the money from that exchange go directly toward an account in the United We Win Halifax’s name to help sponsor the Abdille family. “The sooner we can get the money raised, the sooner we can (complete) the application and get things rolling,” said Aalders, adding they want to sponsor other refugees, seeing how “the need is so great.” Aalders acknowledged that the federal government has put its refugee resettlement programs on hold during the pandemic, but said he hopes they will be able to bring the Abdille family to Canada soon as possible. “They’ll be able to (live) in a healthier environment and not have to worry about (Abdille) dying from not being able to breathe or (Nasteeh),” he said. ‘I would be really happy to see my family’ With the poor housing conditions, dust and extreme heat at the Daadab refugee complex, Gele said she’s concerned the respiratory conditions afflicting her brother and niece will only worsen, making them more susceptible to COVID-19. Gele had asthma herself, but recovered from the disease a year after arriving in Halifax. Living here, she said she’s grateful to have access to an emergency room or a puffer if ever she experiences an asthma attack, but recognizes her family is not so lucky. Aalders said this is concerning, considering how the virus “could spread like wildfire” in a typically overcrowded refugee camp. Ultimately, Gele said she wants her family to be able to live in “good health,” as she hopes for all people, and reunite with them in Halifax. “For 25 years, I haven’t seen my parents or my brother or my family. I have seven children and my children have never seen their uncle or my parents, so I would be really happy to see my family,” she said. “I want to say thank you so much to anyone supporting my family.” Aalders said people can contact United We Win Halifax at unitedwewinhfx@gmail.com for more information about sponsoring the Abdille family or to pitch in for the bottle exchange initiative."

On Wednesday, they announced through a post on Twitter that staff would be handing out single-use surgical masks at Mumford Terminal Thursday morning. Some passengers taking the bus at the terminal Thursday afternoon said the initiative is welcome, but it’s not enough. Shawn Jackson has always taken the bus and she continued to do so through the COVID-19 pandemic. She said she felt safe at the beginning, but as people are becoming more complacent, she’s now feeling the opposite. She said at least half of the passengers on the bus she takes don’t wear masks. “I think it should be mandatory that you wear a mask,” said Jackson. Jackson hadn’t heard that Halifax Transit was handing out free masks. But she said masks would protect all passengers, especially that people can now stand up on the bus. “They all stand up in one spot, right by the middle door. There’s no social distancing in that spot,” she said. In early April, Halifax Transit had prohibited standing on its buses, but they now allow five passengers to stand. “If you’re going to charge a fare and you’re going to re-introduce paying again, everyone has to be protected when they get on there,” she said.  Brenda Dorton also thinks mandatory masks would ensure everyone’s safety. “It’s hard for transit to control what people will do because they’ve been given the option of wearing a mask or not wearing a mask,” she said. Thursday was Dorton’s first time on a bus since Nova Scotia went into a state of emergency. She said she was a bit nervous and is taking precautions to stay safe. She was wearing a mask and carried hand sanitizer to use after getting off the bus.  Robin Pyke has also been avoiding transit for as long as she could. But apartment hunting left her with no choice but to take the bus. Like Jackson, Pyke wasn’t aware that Halifax Transit was handing out masks. But said she always keeps one in her bag to wear at the Halifax Shopping Centre where she works, and now on the bus. “In an indoor situation and even on buses I think there’s definitely logic behind wearing them to help protect other people,” she said. “I think it’s hard to enforce because everybody has different feelings about it.” For a new immigrant in Canada, Twitter may not be the best place to announce mask giveaways.  Nemat Abdul Aleem has only been in Nova Scotia for a month. She doesn’t have any social media accounts, and did not know about the free masks. Abdul Aleem said she wore a mask everywhere when she first came to the province, but as the number of COVID-19 cases dropped, she stopped. Still, she would wear one if it became mandatory. Other passengers said they felt the same. “I don’t feel comfortable wearing one, but if I really have to, for sure I’ll have one,” said Arnault Binja.  Robert Phillips would also wear one if it became mandatory. But he said enforcing masks means they should become more accessible. “There should be some kind of dispensary where you walk through the door and pull one out,” he said. Phillips hadn’t been outside much since the pandemic. But he felt safe on his few transit trips. “People tend to keep their distance. (They would) sit there and mind their business,” he said. On Thursday afternoon, the Mumford Terminal didn’t have more than two dozen people at any time. Route 1 heading to Spring Garden Road in the early afternoon had at most eight passengers, half of whom wore a mask. Phillips said he’s not sure if he would continue to take the bus if it gets crowded. “It might be a little risky. But I think the huge majority of people out and about in the open don’t have COVID anyway to begin with.” In Thursday’s COVID-19 briefing, Dr. Robert Strang said he will continue to strongly recommend wearing masks in spaces where it’s difficult to maintain six feet between people. These spaces include stores, elevators, crowded outdoor spaces and public transit. “We need to make it a habit to always have a mask with us,” he said. People should also continue to follow other public health recommendations, such as handwashing, cleaning high-touch surfaces, and staying at home when feeling unwell."

In her neighbourhood, the Downtown Eastside, drug use is prevalent and so is conflict between users and police. Steinhauer, who uses heroin and cocaine, said she’s thought about being arrested for possession “many times, but it hasn’t happened, which I’m thankful for.” The fear she describes is what experts say has proven deadly time and time again, pushing drug users further underground and away from harm-reduction services. Years deep in an opioid crisis that’s raged across the country and even become deadlier, in some quarters, during the pandemic, Canada’s police chiefs say it’s time to try a different approach. They’re publicly calling for the decriminalization of the personal possession of illicit drugs and for all police agencies in the country to recognize substance abuse and addiction as a public health issue, rather than a criminal one. In a new statement, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police proposed diverting people dealing with substance abuse or addiction issues away from the criminal system and toward social services and health care. The association stipulated such change would need to be synchronized nationally. “Canada continues to grapple with the fentanyl crisis and a poisoned drug supply that has devastated our communities and taken thousands of lives,” said Chief Const. Adam Palmer, president of the CACP in the release. “We recommend that enforcement for possession give way to an integrated health-focused approach that requires partnerships between police, health care and all levels of government.” The report also endorsed access to users of a safe supply of pharmaceutical-grade opioids to combat the uncertain composition of illegal street drugs, which is the cause of many opioid overdoses. It further made a recommendation in favour of supervised consumption sites — where people could use drugs in a clean, safe environment, under the supervision of health professionals trained in emergency intervention. Under the CACP recommendations, police would continue to target drug traffickers, producers and importers. Steinhauer, who is a secretary at the Western Aboriginal Harm Reduction Society, said decriminalizing personal possession of illicit drugs would be a step in the right direction. Police though, she said, need to recognize the damage they do when officers seize drugs from dealers as well. When her regular dealer loses his dope to officers, Steinhauer is sometimes left scrambling and forced to buy drugs from someone she doesn’t know. Sometimes that means the drugs are contaminated. “Then I don’t know what’s in it,” she said. “Sometimes when you’re really sick, you don’t think ‘Oh, I’m going to get it tested.’ You just want to feel better. You want to get your medicine and feel better.” There have been 15,393 apparent opioid-related deaths in Canada between January 2016 and December 2019, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. In May, more than five people in B.C. died every day from illicit drug overdose, the highest number yet recorded in the province, according to the BC Coroners Service. The recommendations from the CACP were spawned by a Special Purpose Committee report titled: Decriminalization for Simple Possession of Illicit Drugs: Exploring Impacts on Public Safety & Policing. Waterloo police Chief Brian Larkin, who co-chairs the CACP’s Special Purpose Committee, said the opioid crisis — which began on the West Coast around 2014 and swept across the country over the next two years — made it clear that some changes were due. “When you look at policing, we’re responsible for advancing public safety in Canada,” said Larkin. “And we have a consensus amongst police leaders, including federally, that it’s time to have a dialogue. What’s been happening in the past clearly is not working for us.” He said in preparing the report, they examined the approaches of countries such as Portugal, Sweden and Norway, where drug possession is still illegal, but criminal sanction, it’s been decided, is not the solution. Drug policy advocates applauded the Canadian police chiefs’ call for decriminalization, but some were wary of the programs that might replace current practices.  “The way that CAPC has framed it, suggests they may be in favour of implementing some kind of administrative regime. So if somebody is found to be in possession, they won’t get criminal charges, but they may get a fine, or they may be forced into treatment,” said Caitlin Shane, a staff lawyer at Pivot Legal Society.  “When people fear arrest, or detention, or any kind of penalty, they’re going to be forced into more precarious scenarios, when using drugs.” The organization has been calling on authorities to recognize the “harms of criminalization” for decades, said Shane. “What we want to see is a situation where no one is penalized, whether criminally or administratively, for possessing small amounts of drugs for personal use.” In the CACP report, the committee outlines the toll of the opioid crisis and why it believes decriminalization of possession alone won’t work. “While decriminalization can reduce some harms for people who use drugs, they are still dependent on an illegal market where the contents and strength of drugs are unknown. The unregulated drug supply in Canada has become toxic leading to overdoses and death.” The recommendations put forth by CACP would require some changes to the Controlled and Substances Act, said Larkin. That puts the onus going forward on the federal government. “At the end of the day, we can suggest, we can recommend, but it’s up to the federal government to introduce legislation,” he said. “But we think that we will have a voice — this isn’t some utopian pie-in-the-sky thing that we’re floating out there. We feel very confident in our discussions with government.” The CACP made it clear that its recommendations for dealing with the opioid crisis were independent of the ongoing conversation on scaling back police funding in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minnesota on May 25. “A decriminalization or diversion model will not provide any opportunity for police agencies to reduce their operating budgets or staffing,” said the report, which was dated July 2020. “Some have suggested that decriminalization would free up police officer time and budgets could be reallocated to other priorities; however, police agencies must continue to resource drug enforcement units dedicated to disrupting the illicit drug markets.”"

Cpl. Jennifer Clarke said the RCMP were called to assist at the Fort Lawrence crossing near the border with New Brunswick just before 8 p.m. Wednesday. She said a man from East Amherst has been charged with assaulting a peace officer and breach of conditions. Jason MacLean, president of the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union, said the incident happened during a routine vehicle inspection, and it’s left the officer shaken. MacLean said the driver objected to the inspection and tried to choke the male officer, who used his radio to call for help from some nearby conservation officers. Those officers helped detain the alleged assailant before the police arrived, he said in an interview Thursday. The officer, MacLean said, “is very lucky that there were conservation officers nearby.” He said vehicle compliance officers have raised concerns about safety in the past because they work alone and are equipped only with radios. During a COVID-19 news conference Thursday, Nova Scotia’s premier said the incident is concerning and thanked public servants for their efforts as the province reopens its borders to Atlantic Canada. But when asked what his government would do to improve safety for peace officers, McNeil accused the union of distracting from wider efforts to recover from the pandemic. “To me, the union has looked at every opportunity to complain and looked to divide,” the premier said. “I will not allow some people to try to divide our province as we continue to work our way through dealing with COVID and reopen our economy.” McNeil said law enforcement agencies will be placed at the border if needed, but said some groups are bringing up past issues while the province tries to move forward. The premier said the province reported no new cases of COVID-19 and one additional recovery from the illness. MacLean said the premier’s outburst reflects a bad attitude towards unions and their safety demands. He noted that his union had not raised the pandemic when discussing Wednesday’s incident, and said the inspection happening at the time was not related to the pandemic or to border controls. “It’s unfortunate that (McNeil) gets that way because we’re speaking out on bona fide issues that are ones of safety,” MacLean said. “We’re going to continue to advocate.” He said the union’s duty is to stand up for members at a time when safety at work is paramount, and that it’s unfortunate the premier interprets safety concerns as sources of division. “Lost in all of this are the heroes that (McNeil) says are out there doing all the work, and I’ll tell you, it’s tough times,” MacLean said."

We joke now that he put the “sand” in sandwich, but it was quite uncomfortable at the time — and not just from a digestion point of view. Luke was five, and his big brother was seven. Hand in hand, they had taken a leap into the unknown — loaded up their backpacks with their towels, sunhats and their wholesome and ample lunches, and trundled off to the local elementary school that was doubling as a municipal day camp for a few weeks that summer. From a mother’s point of view, it was all about some structured summer fun for the kids — cut-and-paste, mixed with supervised soccer and lounging in the playground — while I worked. From the kids’ point of view, it was an unfamiliar world of vague rules and new faces. According to the not-always-reliable reporting from his brother, when lunchtime came, Luke sat down in the sandbox, open his lunchbox and dumped out everything into the sand. And then ate it anyway. Even though he even consumed all his carrots as instructed at home before he left that morning, I was mortified at the lack of close supervision and the sudden need for my youngster to be self-sufficient. Of course, he survived and we both learned something. He needed to take on new responsibility (keeping his lunch out of the dirt). I needed to let go, a little bit. It was the start of a decade-long dance of daring that has pushed both of us to embrace growing up. As day camp turned into overnight camp and eventually specialized baseball camp, every summer experience has heightened that independence — despite the moments of discomfort. Summer camp is childcare with an edge. The kids are tossed into a mixer with the promise of fun and the challenge of more freedom. The parents have time and space to work, but with the nagging challenge of giving their precious charges more scope for autonomy. The experience changes all of us, usually for the better but perhaps with a nervous stomach-ache along the way. For underprivileged children, the Star’s Fresh Air Fund has been an importance source of that experience for the past 120 years. And while this year of pandemic restraints has its particular challenges for summer camp, the fund is campaigning anyway in the hopes of raising $650,000. So far we’ve raised more than $400,000 so far. If COVID-19 gets in the way, we’ll use the money next year and make up for lost time. As an economics writer keeping tabs on the financial fallout of the pandemic, I am continuously reminded that the value of accessible childcare has never been more tangible — camp during the summer and school in September. It’s so central to the way the economy functions. With the kids at home all the time, workers, especially mothers by default, have a difficult time putting in a full day’s work-from-home, and certainly can’t return to the office. Single moms are in a particularly bad bind. Normally staid economists have whooped with joy or crumpled with dismay about the state of their own lives the day they received the notice from their chosen summer camps about their state of re-opening this month. But child advocates go far beyond the economic case for camps, daycares and schooling. As stores and commerce resume, but camps and schools reel with new rules and constraints, child experts remind us frequently that education is an entrenched right — for a good reason. Children are especially vulnerable to being sideswiped by the pandemic restrictions, and yet the effort to resolve the care situation is stilted at best. Just a few months ago, my son had planned his whole summer around the return to baseball camp — where he would strengthen his swing, stay up until the wee hours in his bunk chatting about the game, and be drawn into the worldly experience of the older kids on the roster, despite his mother’s qualms.

That may or may not be enough to persuade the public to forgive him for not recusing himself from the controversial file. But even if it’s not, the $50-billion commitment could go a long way toward giving companies a lifeline as they emerge from the pandemic – as long as it’s designed strategically as well as quickly. The move was foreshadowed last week in Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s fiscal update and has been weeks in negotiation, so let’s not be too cynical about the motivation behind the multi-billion-dollar announcement that Trudeau blurted out within seconds of apologizing for his involvement in the WE fiasco. But there are no details available yet for how the subsidy will work, and for that, we can be plenty cynical. Trudeau had just one sentence about it in his morning news conference, and Morneau’s office would only say — with a smiley face attached — that details were not ready yet, It’s that kind of vague policy announcement that got the prime minister in trouble with the WE file to begin with — a headline designed to fill a political need, with the fine print to come sometime “soon,” once the officials can catch up with the politics of the day. The fine print is important here, for economics and politics alike. Morneau and Trudeau have pinned their hopes for an economic restart on the wage subsidy. In theory, when provincial governments relax their COVID-19 rules, as Ontario’s Doug Ford did on Monday, the wage subsidy will kick in and help companies stay above water when they reopen just half way. Ford said some regions of the province can now open up restaurants, bars and daycares, but not necessarily at full capacity because physical distancing rules remain in place. The hope is that the federal wage subsidy will shoulder a large part of the payroll of any company that is still losing a big chunk of its revenue compared to last year, allowing firms to reopen and bring back their workers even if they’re still constrained due to pandemic rules. But how much of their payrolls will be covered by this extension? How much money does a company have to be losing in order to qualify? And what about companies that are hoping to hire back minimum-wage workers, but can’t find any because they’re collecting the more lucrative Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)? Without those answers, companies won’t know if it’s worth their time and effort to reopen on Friday as the premier hopes, says Perrin Beatty, the president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “We need to get that information as soon as possible,” Beatty said. “It’s critical for tens of thousands of businesses, particularly in some sectors” such as tourism, travel, accommodation, retail and restaurants. When it was first introduced, the wage subsidy was available to companies that could show a 30 per cent drop in revenues compared to last year. But that agreement expired at the end of June, and now, government officials and business leaders alike say the 30 per cent cut-off is too harsh — there’s no incentive for a company hovering near the threshold to make an extra dollar if it might lose its payroll support as a result. Similarly, there’s a growing understanding within government that the CERB had its place in sustaining family finances during the dark days of the lockdown, but now it needs to be wound down and replaced as employers reopen so people will be encouraged to go back to work. These are complex policy questions that officials and experts have been hammering away at with increasing urgency, but that the prime minister — in his haste to have some good news in the face of scandal — rolled out before his civil service had the required paperwork in hand. That’s partly why he ended up in hot water with WE Charity. In late April, as the opposition NDP roared about the lack of financial help for students and threatened to withhold its support for COVID-19 aid without measures, Trudeau unveiled a generous $9-billion student aid package.  Along with commitments to create more summer jobs and extend emergency benefits to students was the creation of the Canada Student Service Grant — the program now swirling at the centre of the WE controversy. It’s now clear that the plan to pay students up to $5,000 for volunteer work was not nearly ready for prime time. After winding its way through cabinet approvals, it finally saw the light of day more than two months later, only to spark an immediate controversy. While the Liberals are paying a political price for that backwards process, students continue to go without their promised support. The wage subsidy talks are well advanced, but the economic stakes of getting the design just right are high. Let’s hope Trudeau didn’t speak too soon again."

Why won't he explain how it happened?,['Susan DelacourtNational Columnist'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","Justin Trudeau made a bold bid to break up with the ethics controversy consuming his government on Monday with a new twist on an old classic: “It’s not WE. It’s me.”  There was nothing vague about the prime minister’s apology for how he and WE Charity have become tangled in an ethics storm over pandemic relief. In fact, Trudeau approached near-mathematical precision on Monday with his very personal regrets for what he had failed to do in the whole mess.  “The mistake we made was on me and I take responsibility for it,” he said. Trudeau said he was sorry he didn’t excuse himself from cabinet discussions about WE Charity, and also sorry he didn’t know more about the extent to which his family was involved with it.  What his apology didn’t cover was how this ended up in front of his cabinet in the first place, and the absence of red flags for him or his government — the crucial “what were you thinking” question that hangs over the entire story.  So while Trudeau’s words on Monday may have slightly cooled the ethics uproar that’s erupted in the midst of this pandemic, they won’t make it go away.  Significantly, his apology also offered no assurances for the future, and that’s important — this being his third brush with ethics investigations in his career as prime minister.  What has he learned about why this failed to set off ethical alarms from the outset? Monday’s me-not-WE apology didn’t quite cover that.  Trudeau’s regrets, for now, are intensely personal — maybe intentionally so. A larger, more expansive apology may not come until after the ethics commissioner’s inquiry.  It’s worth looking closely at how precise the prime minister was when he laid out on Monday where he’d gone wrong with WE and the proposal to have the charity handle nearly $1 billion in pandemic relief for students.  Trudeau did not say he was sorry about the idea, which he again said came from the public service, only that he didn’t officially bow out of the discussions about it.  “I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions, given our family’s history. I am sincerely sorry about not having done that,” Trudeau said, going on to cite all the ways the government had been working with other charities on pandemic relief. “But when it came to this organization and this program, the involvement I’d had in the past and my family has should have had me remove myself from those discussions.”  Note: Trudeau is not saying that the proposal shouldn’t have come to cabinet, only that he shouldn’t have been there. The prime minister also didn’t mention Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who has been found to have his own family conflicts with WE, including a daughter employed by the charity. It was left to Morneau to issue his own personal apology later in the day, in a separate statement, which followed the same general lines as those of his boss: not a bad idea, just unfortunately handled at cabinet.  Significantly, the finance minister hasn’t even ruled out the prospect of WE being the subject of cabinet discussions in future. “I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE,” Morneau’s statement said.  The most sincere, genuine part of Trudeau’s apology came when he was talking about how all of this has affected his mother, who has been very public — including at WE events — about her lifelong battles with mental illness.  “Obviously I knew she worked with WE,” Trudeau said. “I didn’t know the details of how much she was getting paid by various organizations but I should have and I deeply regret that. What I also deeply regret is the fact that I have brought my mother into this situation in a way that is really unfair to her.” Margaret Trudeau’s involvement with WE was definitely obvious. She and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau were together in London at a WE event in March, which is where the prime minister’s wife was believed to have contracted the COVID-19 virus that put the PM into isolation early in the pandemic.  Long before WE was picked as the favoured charity to hand out aid to students during the pandemic, in other words, it had already played a role that was a little too close to home.  Trudeau may be saving the larger, more expansive explanations for his discussions with the ethics commissioner, who will most certainly want to know more than just why the prime minister failed to absent himself from cabinet discussions about WE Charity. “It’s not WE, it’s me,” may work as a break in the heat of this controversy, but those won’t be the last words in this fraught relationship.

For all the ways in which their lives have intersected over the years, Rae and Trudeau were never particularly close. They both have strong ties to Ontario politics — Rae as a former New Democratic Party premier, Trudeau as a politician who surrounded himself with veterans of Queen’s Park from the days of Liberal power there. Nine years ago, Rae was holding the reins of the federal Liberal party on an interim basis after the disaster of the 2011 election, when what was once Canada’s “natural governing party” was knocked back to third place in the Commons. A dispirited Trudeau, having served one rookie term as a member of Parliament, was thinking of abandoning his career in politics.  Had Trudeau gone ahead with that escape plan, Rae might well have ended up turning that temporary job into the full-fledged one as leader of the Liberal party. But that’s not how the universe unfolded. Trudeau took the leader’s job and it was Rae, the former Ontario premier, who went off to post-political life: teaching, doing some legal work, some international diplomacy, even a lively podcast. Rae, who will be turning 72 next month, also got to spend time fishing, playing the piano and enjoying his grandchildren and his family cottage on Big Rideau Lake. Something changed, though, after last fall’s election, which saw Trudeau’s power cut down to size and doing all that thinking. Rae started being pulled back again into the orbit of Trudeau’s government, starting with polite, deferential requests for advice. The first subject was minority government — Trudeau’s new reality after the votes were counted on Oct. 21. Rae has a rich history with them. It was Rae’s proposed amendment to a 1979 budget — when he was an NDP MP in the Commons — that brought down Joe Clark’s Conservative minority government and paved the way for the return of Pierre Trudeau to power in 1980. In Ontario, Rae helped negotiate an accord that put David Peterson’s Liberals in power at Queen’s Park in 1985. Through his five decades in elected office, Rae has seen minorities come and go, at the federal and provincial level. “Don’t get discouraged,” Rae said this week, when asked what he said in those initial, post-election conversations with the current prime minister. “You know, this is not the end of the world and there’s a chance to rebuild … It’s a good chance to listen and figure out what happened.” Trudeau was, in fact, listening. “It was a good conversation,” Rae said. “He was very friendly and it was very direct.” Then again, right after the Christmas break, Rae’s counsel was sought once more; this time because of Ukraine International Airlines crash in Iran that killed 138 people with ties to Canada. Trudeau and his advisers wanted to know what Rae had learned when doing his major report into the 1985 Air India crash. It was in part because of Rae’s counsel, PMO officials said at the time, that Trudeau spent so much time in January with the families of the victims. A couple of weeks later, Rae headed to Winnipeg to be part of Trudeau’s winter cabinet retreat, talking to ministers about the work he had been doing as a special adviser on the Rohingya humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, also known as Burma, and Bangladesh. For a man who had left politics, Rae was spending an awful lot of time around Trudeau and his team in those first months after the election. Then came the call for lunch — a one-on-one conversation between Rae and Trudeau themselves. It was, incredibly, the first time the two men had sat down together without other people in the room or on the phone. “That was the first meeting I’d had with him alone,” Rae said. “He used to rely a lot on having other people there in the room. That’s not true anymore.” The prime minister asked Rae outright: would he be interested in a diplomatic appointment? “I said, ‘sure … what you do have in mind?’” Rae recalled. Trudeau told him that some posts might be coming up in the summer, as the decks were changed at Canadian missions abroad. Rae said he’d consider one if it was offered, and then Trudeau asked Rae if he would also be willing to pitch in with some help trying to win Canada a seat on the UN Security Council. Canada didn’t win that security council seat — despite best efforts from Rae and Trudeau and others — but Rae did get a new job. Several weeks ago, Rae was quietly offered the post of ambassador to the United Nations, and Trudeau made it official last Monday. This is a milepost — not just in the relationship between these two politicians, but also in Canada’s history and foreign policy. A global pandemic is shaking the world order, which was already being rocked by great powers such as the United States, China and Britain turning more boldly nationalist. In some ways, the pandemic has accelerated that trend toward nations putting themselves first. COVID-19 has slammed borders shut — including the one between the U.S. and Canada — and citizens around the world have had months to dwell on the perils of a highly interconnected world. Canada, in the midst of this, is facing the same choice as other nations: turn inward or double down on internationalism. Trudeau has very clearly chosen the latter, and he’s put one of Canada’s most senior political statesmen as his representative at the global crossroads of the United Nations. It is a significant shift between Trudeau in his first term and in his second term, Rae said. “The number-one priority for the government in the first term was managing the relationship with the United States and in particular, the free-trade issue,” Rae said, “but more broadly, just trying to manage the relationship with the (Donald) Trump administration.” It’s not like that relationship has become unimportant, Rae said, but Trudeau’s sights are set wider now, to the larger sets of alliances that Canada needs to build in the world. “COVID is a global event. It’s not a Canadian event or a U.S. event,” Rae said. “I think there’s a tendency to underestimate the truly global nature of this pandemic … It’s forcing everyone to realize that there are a lot of ways in which the world is changing.” The COVID-19 pandemic has often been compared to a war. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said early in the lockdown that she hoped this crisis would yield another “greatest generation,” the name given to the citizens who helped rebuild after the Second World War. Rae is a son of that generation, which also helped create the United Nations, and his father, Saul Rae, was one of Canada’s leading diplomats in this era. In the 1970s, Rae’s father served in the post that his son will take up in August, as Canada’s ambassador to the United Nations. Rae is touched, of course, by the chance to honour his father’s memory by following in his footsteps. In a way, he says, just as age has made him recognize how much he is like his father, the pandemic has made him recognize the similarities between the challenges of that century and this one. “He was very much part of the generation of diplomats who realized coming out of the Second World War they had worlds to try to build and they weren’t alone,” Rae said. “We’re rebuilding after COVID.”  This can’t just be a domestic exercise, Rae says. “I don’t think we can afford the luxury of ignoring what’s going on in the rest of the world,” he says. “There are a number of countries that are on the verge of financial collapse and that will come to the attention of everybody pretty quickly,” Rae says. In fact, when he was being asked this week how he foresaw his main job at the United Nations, Rae was saying: “that’s issue number one … that’s staring us in the face. That’s what we have to talk about in New York and wherever else we do business multilaterally.” Beyond that, the UN could well turn into an important place to negotiate the global rollout of a vaccine, he says, whenever that does arrive. That same tension, between nations looking out for themselves and a co-ordinated, global approach, will play out with the vaccine, Rae says. “The UN is one of the places where these conversations need to happen and do happen.” The Star’s Martin Regg Cohn wrote this week how Rae’s entire career had prepared him for the role he is about to take on at the United Nations. While Rae is a little too down-to-earth to talk in terms of destiny, he does have a lifetime of experience accumulated to help him pull off what this job demands. He attended a UN school in Geneva as a child when his father was posted there, and some of the friendships he forged in those days still endure. As premier from 1990 to 1995, Rae was intensely involved with constitutional negotiations in Canada and labour negotiations in Ontario; skills he will need at the UN. His legal and political work has taken him from Indigenous communities at home to refugee outposts around the world. Rae, in short, specializes in complicated situations — and the UN is going to be a complex place in a pandemic-wracked world. When asked to predict what he’d enjoy most about the new job, Rae says: “the scope and diversity of it …. I mean, there are very few jobs where you have as many different forces and countries and people at play.” He’s looking forward to living in New York too, as is Arlene Perly Rae; the two celebrated their 40th anniversary earlier this year. “I’ve never lived there before,” he says. “New York City itself is an interesting place.” But it does mean leaving the rather pleasant life that Rae created for himself after leaving politics — he thought for good. He laughs when asked whether he’d be doing a tone change of his social-media posts, which are often politically pointed; also funny. Rae says he’ll be diplomatic, but he won’t stop being himself. One of his friends joked to him this week that he was voluntarily putting the “harness” of duty back on. “I know what that’s like: your schedule is no longer your own, you’ve got to turn up and you’ve got to be here, you’ve got to be there …. I’m reporting to people and people are reporting to me and you’re part of a bigger system,” Rae says. He takes that on willingly, eagerly — it is now, in retrospect, where things were heading from the moment that Trudeau started doing all that thinking after the election and pulling Rae into that process. Saying no was not really an option. “I know there are people who are going to say ‘you’re getting pretty long in the tooth,’” he says. “I actually think as long as I’ve got my health and I’ve got my marbles, I think it’s worth making the effort. This really is a significant global crisis and to not be engaged in it would be wrong.”"

The symphony announced Tuesday during an online news conference it will stream live concerts to paying audiences in September — Mozart’s Jupiter Symphony, and others by Beethoven and Mendelssohn. The musicians will be onstage at Centre in the Square, with two metres between all the players. “Some people don’t think we are essential, but we are more essential than anyone thinks,” said symphony music director Andrei Feher, “because everybody realizes artists are important these days, and how much they help.” The exact dates, programs and ticket prices for the live streams will be made public later this summer. The coming season will also include special guest artists such as Canadian singer-songwriter Royal Wood and singer Michael Vanhevel. Nobody knows how the COVID-19 pandemic will play out, but the symphony did not want to simply wait for a vaccine. “We are trying as much as possible to get back and making music together, offer something new, offer something different,” said Feher. Feher’s first child, a boy named Mihai, was born March 10. The next day the symphony announced it was cancelling the rest of the 2019-20 season. While the economy slowly reopens in stages, concert halls will likely have to wait until there is a vaccine before audiences can pack the seats. But nobody knows for sure. Andrew Bennet, the symphony’s executive director, said governments have provided between $600,000 and $700,000 in emergency funds during the first stages of the pandemic, and a similar amount will be needed to see the symphony through the 2020-21 season. Bennett said donors large and small have given much more than usual to the organization, but specifics will not be known until the organization’s fiscal year ends later this summer. The remaining parts of the 2020-21 season will be announced in blocks, he said, because of the uncertainty caused by the pandemic. “It allows us then to keep changing what we are doing on a month-to-month basis going through the season,” said Bennett. “We will start off in one mode, and be ready to go into the next mode whenever it proves possible.” If there is a second wave of COVID-19, the entire country, or parts of it, could be locked down again. If a vaccine is available early next year, the symphony could return to live concerts with audiences inside Centre in the Square.  The original program for the 2020-21 season will be delayed for 12 months and be presented in 2021-22. That allows the symphony to meet its commitment to subscribers. Tickets already purchased for the coming season will be automatically transferred to 2021-22, said Bennett. In October, the symphony will organize a party online to celebrate its 75th anniversary. “I am looking forward to a great online party,” said Bennett. “I am looking forward to having some guests from all over the world who can possibly join us who wouldn’t be able to do so otherwise.” Heather Galt, chair of the symphony’s board, said the encore performances the symphony has streamed online every Friday evening for the past few months have attracted huge audiences. “We have been incredibly pleased,” said Galt. “We have been able to reach audience sizes that we could never have imagined before the pandemic.” Those audience numbers demonstrate the symphony brings joy and much needed breaks from the unprecedented international crisis that has impacted everyone’s life, she said. “We are absolutely committed as a board and an organization to continue doing that even during this time,” said Galt. “That sense of joy and that sense of rest, we really need now more than ever,” said Galt, adding the board is committed to surviving the short term and being around for another 75 years and beyond."

It was during a lecture by a visiting professor at a scientific conference in Tehran, and as soon as she saw the beautiful image of the waterfalls she wanted to go there. The visiting professor at the conference was from the University of Waterloo, and in 2010 Zar came here to do her PhD in chemistry. “It’s funny, sometimes these little things change the path of your life,” says Zar, who still lives in Waterloo. She grew up surrounded by beauty in the ancient city of Qazvin. It is about two hours drive from Tehran and the centre of the ancient Persian art form of calligraphy. Close to her family home in Qazvin is a statue of Mir Ahmad, the man credited with founding the Persian form of calligraphy. Her family home was filled with old beautiful furniture because her father bought and sold antiques, and filled his house with some of the best ones he found. “From early childhood I was exposed to beautiful architecture and sculptures, all these things have elements of calligraphy,” Zar says. “Calligraphy is known as the number-one art in my city,” she adds. “A lot of my fellow artists knew how to write beautifully as a calligrapher.” The art form is part of the school curriculum in Iran, and that was Zar’s first exposure to calligraphy in 2004. By the time she saw that photo of Niagara Falls, Zar had completed her undergrad and Master’s in chemistry. After she came to the University of Waterloo in 2010, Zar continued to practice and experiment with different brushes, inks, pens and surfaces. Zar is passionate about Persian poetry. In her calligraphy she reproduces lines from famous poets, and from the Holy Qur’an. She did a placement at the Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery, helping with public programs. It was a great way to learn about Canadian, contemporary and Indigenous art. “I used this as a tool to both educate and introduce this traditional art to the community,” says Zar. She calls her calligraphy a bridge between the culture of her homeland, and her life in Canada. “I receive and I give, which makes it very rewarding to me,” says Zar. After finishing her PhD in 2015, Zar founded a business — Ati Zar artisan — to bring together Iranian artists living in this region. They gathered to both work and socialize. That’s how she first learned about the Coalition of Muslim Women of KW, and Zar started showing some of her calligraphy at festival’s organized by the coalition. “And then I noticed that even those with no background in Islam are interested, and little by little, I gained confidence,” says Zar. “I learned how I can communicate through this art with the larger community.” Along with TheMuseum, Zar is the co-organizer of this fall’s exhibition called “Harmony and Beauty in Islamic Art.” It is the fourth time TheMuseum and the Coalition of Muslim Women have collaborated on an exhibition. Works of art in all mediums — paintings, calligraphy, photography, ceramics, quilting, metal, woodwork and collage — are welcome. Interested artists should submit their work for consideration by Wednesday, July 15 to the Coalition of Muslim Women. For two years, Zar says she focused solely on her art. After realizing that even established artists struggle to pay their bills, she went to work with a med-tech startup that was founded nearly a year ago. It is using artificial intelligence sensors to develop a hand-held scanner to detect the location of blocked or burst arteries in a stroke victim’s brain. Her calligraphy keeps her rooted in her homeland and builds links to the wider community in this region. She did not plan to stay in Canada, but fell in love with a man here, married and built many connections through her art. A strong sense of belonging and community are among the most important reasons why Zar decided to stay in Canada and make her life here. “And I find Canada as my second home after I become a citizen, after I know more about Canadian culture, Canadian art,” says Zar. She sees herself as part of a multicultural community. “And I can identify myself, acknowledge my background as a Persian Muslim girl who is doing art and science and can have everything at the same time,” says Zar. “Being a Canadian and an Iranian, a scientist and an artist, it gives me a good feeling,” says Zar. “Not losing my ethnicity, not losing my religion, and being accepted for who I am.”"

Hjin is 19 and called his album “Before We are 20.” Available on several streaming services, it includes 10 original songs, and one cover of a Leonard Cohen tune. Hjin plays guitar and sings throughout the album. It is the second recording for Hjin, who has also released an EP with four jazz standards recorded live during one of his trio’s performances at The Jazz Room in Waterloo.  As soft-spoken as he is talented, Hjin was born in South Korea. His parents are professional musicians. His father, Mike, plays guitar. His mother, Sunny, plays piano. They worked as studio musicians, arrangers and producers.  The family moved to Kitchener in 2009, and Hjin started playing guitar not long afterwards. He learned his favourite songs by Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Eric Clapton. “It was just a lot of blues and rock,” said Hjin. Impressed with his progress, his parents urged him to start exploring jazz. So Hjin started listening to and emulating guitarists Pat Metheny and Wes Montgomery, and the lightning-fast saxophone solos of bebop innovator Charlie Parker. “That was probably around Grade 7,” said Hjin. When he started high school, Hjin attended Cameron Heights Collegiate. It has a diverse student population, and lots of resources, including a music program. Hjin loved it.  Every Saturday he was going to Toronto to attend the Humber College community school as well. On those days Hjin’s teacher was one of the leading jazz guitarists in the country — Lorne Lofsky.  Inquisitive, hard working, with a great attitude and up for anything, is how Lofsky describes the young guitar player. “He has something called ‘perfect pitch,’” said Lofsky. “Anything he hears he can recognize it, and emulate it right away.” Calling him extremely talented, Lofsky said Hjin soaked up all the lessons. “I had a great time teaching him,” said Lofsky. “We did a lot of playing and talking, mainly playing.” The group KW Big Band Theory was playing in Hjin’s high school and working with some of the students there. Tim Moher plays tenor and soprano sax with the band, and he remembers hearing Hjin play guitar when he was in Grade 9. “By Grade 10 or so I said: ‘Dave, we have to play together.’ And I hired him for street gigs up in Waterloo,” said Moher. Moher calls Hjin “a musical genius.” For inventiveness and sensitivity, he’s never heard anyone like him. Moher’s latest CD is a fusion of jazz, classical and Celtic music called “The Clefs of Moher.” Hjin plays on every track. Moher remembers one recording session when Hjin picked up a baritone guitar for the first time and played it for a few minutes. He used it to record the next track. “He just laid it down, he liked the sound,” said Moher. When Hjin was in Grade 11 he was playing guitar for KW Big Band Theory. The 17-piece ensemble plays a mix of jazz standards and new material. For a long time, the band leader was Robin Habermehl. “Incredible,” said Habermehl. “Nice kid, unbelievable musician. He has perfect pitch and a photographic memory.” Habermehl remembers leading the band through a rehearsal. Something wasn’t right. He stopped the musicians and studied the score in front of him. He asked Hjin to come up and look at the music and see if he could spot what was wrong. “Right from his chair he said: ‘The second trumpet should have a flat nine on that chord,’ and he’s looking at this guitar chart,” said Habermehl.  “Dave had already figured it out by listening to it, then he would play the chord on his guitar and said: ‘He needs to be playing a D flat,’” said Habermehl. Moher remembers the first time Hjin played with Big Band Theory, and the reaction of the band members when they heard Hjin’s first solo. “Everyone looked over, jaws on the floor,” said Moher. “Gifted, very gifted.” Hjin practices incessantly. On the way into the Humber College community school on Saturday mornings he sat in the back of a van and played his guitar. On the way home, same thing. At home, he practices for up to six hours a day. “And the nicest kid, no ego, no crap,” said Habermehl. “He was always respectful, never bragged, was very humble.” Habermehl calls Hjin one of the finest musicians he’s ever known. “Like scary good,” he said. When Hjin graduated from Cameron Heights his parents gave him a very special guitar — a 1971 Gibson ES-335. Hjin chipped in to help pay for it. He was accepted into the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but opted for the jazz program at Humber College. He is halfway through that program, and not yet out of his teens. Hjin is still developing as a musician. And those who know his playing can not help but wonder what the future will bring. “It’s really interesting,” said Moher. “He’s still a kid.” "

This is in Acapulco and the shooters are members of a powerful cartel with a vendetta against your journalist husband for reporting on their brutalities. And you own a bookstore and only recently found out that the leader of the cartel was one of your favourite customers.  How will you get away? That’s the opening chapter of “American Dirt,” a novel about Mexican migrants, published in January and chosen by Oprah for her Book Club. The author, Jeanine Cummins, received a seven-figure advance for it and it was blurbed glowingly by authors Stephen King, Ann Patchett, Sandra Cisneros and Julia Alvarez. Don Winslow calls it “a ‘Grapes of Wrath’ for our time.” I couldn’t put it down. Lydia Perez and her son, Luca, leave her now dead mother’s home where the police are barely investigating the shooting that took 16 of their relatives. (She suspects that the police are under the control of Javier, the cartel leader.)  Lydia and Luca spend the night in a hotel under a false name but in the morning a parcel arrives, a book of fiction from Javier with a love note. She and Luca manage to evade the black SUVs in the parking lot and board a series of buses to head for Mexico City. What follows is a desperate and fear-ridden journey to “el Norte.” If they can escape across the U.S.-Mexico border, she has an uncle in Denver whom she hopes will take them in.  First she tries to fly to Tijuana but airlines require her son’s birth certificate. So, like scores of other Mexicans, they walk countless miles and learn to ride atop freight trains. They join migrants from other Latin American countries, including two sisters from Honduras. Rebeca and Soledad are teens who followed their father from their village to the city, only to become sex slaves for a gangland pimp.  Lydia has gone from a comfortable middle-class life to a living hell. While she was aware that her husband’s work put their family in some danger (his newspaper would put them up in a hotel for a few days after each cartel story was published), she was regrettably naïve as to the depths of evil that Javier, whom she saw as a sophisticated bibliophile, was carrying out. And the plight of migrants was outside her comfortable life in Acapulco. Now she too will have her money stolen and witness the murders and accidental deaths of several fellow travellers.  But the way north is, like the Underground Railway, not without its angels — they survive with the help of the kindness of strangers. “There is always a smile, a blessing, a flare of recognition from the hardworking young man, who … imagines his own little sister or cousin or daughter in the place of these girls.” “American Dirt” is an adrenalin-fueled page-turner. This is the story of human beings escaping unbelievable violence in hopes of surviving in a country not controlled by brutal cartels.  But the book has been met with controversy, claiming that a white writer is too privileged to have empathy for her Latino and Mexican characters. The author spent four years researching the migrant experience and cites several migrant chronicles written by non-whites. She still felt unqualified to write this book but was advised by a Chicana academic: “We need as many voices as we can get, telling this story.”  For this reader, I am grateful that she did. In a better world, so would the President of the United States. We Canadians need to face our own racism and open our hearts to immigrants — all are human beings, like our own forbearers, in search of a better life. "
99,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/entertainment/art/2020/06/02/the-visual-artist-has-been-forgotten-during-the-pandemic.html,‘The visual artist has been forgotten’ during the pandemic,['Robert Williams'],"Wed., June 3, 2020","WATERLOO — The public display of art is a time-honoured tradition, a duality of nerves and excitement as the artist bares their soul to the larger community in hopes of inspiring wonder, conversation and change.  But in the time of COVID-19, when the need for escapism through art and beauty has never been greater, the art world has needed to get creative to stay relevant.  Art galleries across Waterloo Region were among the many businesses forced to close amid the pandemic. Other public institutions that host pop-up shows and art installations have also been forced to cancel or postpone. Instead, art has gone digital, with gallery catalogues and art shows moving to the online realm. “Soulfully, art is essential for one’s well-being,” said Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery executive director Shirley Madill. “It’s been shown throughout history, and I think we often miss that.” Consider Pablo Picasso’s “Guernica,” she said, painted in immediate reaction to the Nazis’ bombing practices on the Basque town of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. Or contemporary artist Ai Weiwei, whose work and activism has been in direct response to the Chinese government’s human rights record. “It’s not only escapism, it’s also where the answers are,” said Madill. “Artists, throughout time, have always addressed those issues. It’s why we’ve wanted to put more of an emphasis on engaging the public to show the critical effect art can have in difficult times. ” Shut in their homes, spending hours locked in studios, some artists have been given the gift of time to focus on their craft during COVID-19. And Madill is confident a new wave of pandemic-inspired work is on its way. But what has been lost in the meantime? “The visual artist has been forgotten,” said Mitzi Schnabel, a member of the Kitchener-Waterloo Society of Artists. “I understand how it has happened, I do. But as we move forward, I think it is a better place for everyone in the community when we have art.” For some artists, their livelihood has been at stake amid the standstill. For others, the opportunity to network and make new connections at exhibitions.  The society, which was forced to cancel several of its art shows since March, has transitioned to an online model as a way to continue showcasing the work of its 150 members. Everything from paintings to photographs to sculptures — the work has continued while the world has stood still.  “It’s been really interesting see what the artists have been up to over the last few months,” said Moumita Roychowdhury, one of the brains behind the online art show, and an artist in her own right. “It’s been disappointing because there haven’t been any public exhibitions for artists. But at the same time, we’re finding a new way of expressing ourselves.” The online platform is exposing the work to people from outside the region, but it’s not the only virtual platform artists are taking advantage of.  Art classes, in the absence of physical gatherings, are now being offered on Zoom and other video providers. Roychowdhury is running her classes from home, and developing a new cohort of students in the progress — some in the region, others beyond. “A lot of my students are now based outside of Kitchener-Waterloo, even outside Canada, and it’s really opened up some opportunities,” she said. “Now that there is no other way, people are starting to see that it’s a good opportunity.” Roychowdhury intends to continue offering the virtual classes after the pandemic, combining the distance learners with her local students. But there is something that’s lost on a computer screen when it comes to the visual arts — a physical presence that can’t be captured through a lens. And as the province continues with its phased reopening of the economy, spectators will soon be able to flock to the latest exhibition, in search of the answers of what this has all meant. “I’ve seen some of the work that’s being produced,” said Madill. “And you’re going to see some of that darkness, the ugliness that is out there. But you’re also going to see some artists produce a bright light, a beacon through this situation. ”"

This year is different. With lockdown wiping out a third of their 2020 operating hours, the pandemic nearly forced their permanent closure.  “We were done,” says Kristine Mathers, restaurant co-owner. “We had accepted it.” Their location at Sunset Villa, partially obscured by a stone wall, doesn’t attract foot traffic. With fixed monthly costs of four to five figures (exclusive of rent), after temporarily closing, they borrowed money (including receiving the federal Canadian Emergency Business Account loan) to keep afloat.  While the Sunset Villa Association waived three months’ rent, without knowing when or how they could reopen, the restaurant’s owners — Mathers, her brother, Jacob Beck, and his partner, Joanne Moyes — weighed their options. “We’re only two years old and had startup debt; we’re still just making minimum wage doing this,” says Mathers. “Being a small business, it’s all personal debt. We fully decided we were going to have to close.” In one form or another, there’s been a restaurant at Sunset Villa since the 1950s. The association’s board reached out and got a deep dive into the restaurant business before launching a two-week GoFundMe campaign. They raised more than $120,000 by June 1 and then, with the help of a local business owner, reached an agreement allowing the restaurant to reopen for the foreseeable future. “That was absolutely huge for us. We can’t operate out of guilt and passion and all of those wonderful things that drive things forward but then leave us in a ridiculous amount of debt.” Before the pandemic, Canada’s food service sector was expected to grow to $77.5 billion; revised outlooks now predict a precipitous drop, some saying to $38.4 billion (where it was in 2003). Razor-thin margins, sometimes bringing in only a few dollars per table, leave many Canadian restaurants struggling: 10 per cent closed within a couple of weeks of lockdown; currently, 60 per cent operate at a loss and 50 per cent risk permanent closure by summer’s end. There are layers to partially reopening under emergency orders. Without clear official guidelines, The Danish Place owners have turned to industry association Restaurants Canada for information. Additional expenses (disposables, sanitizing supplies, staff) need to be paid for while their 90-seat dining room is closed and patio is reduced to 20 seats. They’re requiring face coverings and physical distancing but returning to work, and increased exposure risk, means friends removed themselves from Mathers’ and her young daughter’s in-person circle.  The Danish Place’s website has detailed instructions on placing orders for pickup and making patio reservations. Right now, they’re open for a few hours on Saturdays and Sundays and they’ve edited their menu to smørrebrød (open-faced sandwiches); hot meals are in the works.  While perfect for a picnic, I grazed on the House Special Platter ($40), a lined cardboard flat that could easily feed four, over a few days. Slices of rye and French bread. Piles of savoury, rustic house-made leverpostej (pâté) with bacon and mushrooms; velvety, fatty rullepølse (cured pork belly) with aspic; tender, sliced frikadelle (meatball); waves of roast beef; gorgeously pongy esrom cheese, and, since I can’t have salmon, little bouncy poached shrimp.  Pots of butter, mayonnaise, vinegary herring, vibrant puce pickled cabbage, mustard-kicked remoulade, and crunchy pickles. Smear the bread, layer the topping and dot with pickle, sliced onions or bell peppers. I’m sure there are rules but when you’re under a tree or at your desk, build and eat your sandwich as you will. That week, they made Jordbærgrød, a lightly sweetened strawberry compote ($6). I ate it as recommended: cold, with a lashing of heavy cream. Summer in a bowl. Navigating the complexities of what used to be and what’s needed now is the hallmark of these Inbetween Times. Hopefully, we will find that sweet spot, because sweet spots like The Danish Place are hard to find.

101,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/life/food-wine/opinion/2020/07/06/systemic-racism-impacts-how-we-view-food-and-reviewers-in-waterloo-region.html,Systemic racism impacts how we view food — and reviewers — in Waterloo Region,['Jasmine Mangalaseril'],"Mon., July 6, 2020","I was a food writer for 12 years before The Record asked me to join their restaurant review team. Apart from my own sites, my byline appeared on well-known ones and now-defunct ones. I authored a white paper for a popular appliance manufacturer. Local and national media interviewed me a few times. I gave talks about food history and appeared on discussion panels on both sides of the border.  After my first Record review ran, a local acquaintance told me I shouldn’t write under my name and every picture of me should be removed from the internet. He didn’t think I should be recognized as the author of my work, although my white colleagues were credited for theirs. I politely ended my reply with, “I’m not easily erased.” He abruptly ended the exchange. I wasn’t surprised. I was born in Kitchener, grew up here, and got my degree from the University of Waterloo. Like other visible minorities, I’m well acquainted with the area’s casual and overt racism: Kids in school called me the N-word. Sales clerks follow me. Restaurant servers try to deny service. We see hate platformed, read gaslighting comments, and hear fauxpologies. Whenever someone demands to know where I’m “really” from, I’m reminded that to some, being Canadian is only skin deep.  That sense of who can and cannot be Canadian is woven into the national fabric. For Canada’s first 100 years, immigration policies prioritized those who could easily blend into colonial culture. Policies and regulations created an unofficial colour bar that throttled immigration from China and India. While not legislated, Wilfrid Laurier’s cabinet approved banning Black immigration. Japanese Canadians’ voting rights were withheld until 1949; Indigenous Peoples didn’t receive universal suffrage until 1982.  Shifting public attitudes of the 1960s led to Lester B. Pearson’s government overhauling our immigration system. Applicants earned points for things such as education, work skills, and language skills; race wasn’t supposed to be a factor. A few years later, in 1971, Pierre Trudeau adopted the Bilingualism and Biculturalism Commission’s recommendation to make multiculturalism national policy.  But reversing a century of systemic racism doesn’t happen overnight.  Black Lives Matter has laid bare deep-seated biases against Black people and other marginalized groups, with conversations turning to how these attitudes flow in the undercurrents of our daily lives: salaries and promotions, social media moderation, how we think about food. I know I’m a rare flower in that I’m a bylined, paid, freelance food writer, who happens to be of South Indian ancestry. This field is traditionally populated by white writers focused on urban, white, bourgeois diners. These writers often elevate certain cuisines to three-star haute status while they devalue immigrant cuisines to cheap eats, particularly when made by immigrant hands. They’ll blur regional foods into Chinese, Latino, and Indian abstractions, and coo over the curiosity of “ethnic” foods, when gentrified or appropriated by white personalities. Contemporary food writing isn’t entirely fogged by exhausted views. Independent voices and staff writers, like some now at The New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, and Food & Wine, don’t necessarily look like, think like, or eat like their predecessors and are more reflective of their communities and generations. While some continue the aspirational chase for “the best places,” others unearth compelling stories in tasty places. Condescending eyes aren’t cast on diasporic cuisines or their labour. Restaurants and chefs previously fawned over aren’t automatically slid easy praise.  Change is difficult, especially after decades of magazines, newspapers, radio, and TV reinforcing cultural biases. Some eaters are flummoxed with opinions, voices, or faces that don’t fit the old mould. Without reading my work, a woman told me I’m unqualified to write about “white people’s food” because I wasn’t raised on it. When I said that must also mean white people who weren’t raised eating Japanese, Chinese, Thai and other non-European cuisines weren’t qualified to write about them, she mumbled something and walked away.  I’ve been told restaurants in Waterloo’s University District — a young area, chockablock with diasporic cuisines often cooked by non-white hands — aren’t “worthy” of review. Patronizing comments like “who can eat this?” echo sentiments about stinky, spicy, unclean foreign foods. My foodways writing spotlights cuisines our neighbours bring with them, but some insist those aren’t “the most important” ones. As one person said, “we don’t eat like this.”  But we do.  More than 50 years after immigration reforms, Waterloo Region’s population includes more than 220 ethnicities and one in five of us identify as a visible minority. How we think of ourselves should evolve with our community. How we tell today’s stories — from business to arts to sports to culture to food — should reflect who we are now. Not who we were in the decades before I was born. Not who those in far-off glass towers think we are.  We may not have eaten like this in 1950, but we do eat like this in 2020. Because that’s who we really are."
102,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/life/food-wine/review/2020/07/02/dining-in-little-mushroom-provides-a-super-supper-break-from-covid-kitchen-duties.html,Dining In: Little Mushroom provides a super supper break from COVID kitchen duties,['Alex Bielak'],"Thu., July 2, 2020","In early 2020, after 10 years growth, from a solo operation to a company with more than 40 staff, Cambridge-based Little Mushroom Catering and Dining Lounge was doing nearly 60 functions — and sponsoring almost one community event — every week.  They won 2019 Business of the Year awards from both the Greater K-W and Cambridge chambers of commerce, and were named the inaugural Caterer of the Year by Food Awards Ontario.  Anticipating 20 per cent revenue growth, founder and chief executive officer Stephanie Soulis was busy outfitting a 30-seat dining lounge adjacent to her new 7,000-square-foot state-of-the-art kitchen and looking forward to a long summer vacation to the east coast with her husband and three youngsters. Then, COVID. Soulis says she cried when she had to lay off 90 per cent of her staff, leaving just four people to try to keep things going. Suddenly, she was back in the kitchen, helping head chef Rachel Medeiros, delivering food, and managing orders till the wee hours, while still staying connected with the community. Soulis describes it as “being a startup again but with the overhead of a well-established company.” Their existing systems proved sufficiently robust to easily accommodate the shift from a focus on catering events and weddings, to prepared meal delivery. Though government assistance has allowed her to rehire three employees, that aid has barely kept them afloat, she says. Without a break on rent, and operating at about 10 per cent of projected revenues, she says she recently, reluctantly, discontinued providing free food and groceries to laid-off staff. Seemingly indefatigable, Soulis also chairs the Kitchener Library, serves on Waterloo Region Tourism Marketing Corporation’s board, and is assisting with a local mental health initiative for the hospitality industry.  Despite the evident strain, she’s kept true to her core values as a social entrepreneur, still finding ways to give back, including through a pay-it-forward boxed-lunch program that has seen $15,000 of meals donated to hospital and long-term-care facility staff. Little Mushroom was also just Pride-certified as a LGBTQ safe space. Soulis is also constantly seeking to partner with local businesses, particularly those run by women and/or minorities. That’s how a terrific sweet potato and tarragon dressing from MH Fine Foods in Cambridge found its way onto the fresh but otherwise undistinguished garden salad ($8) we enjoyed as part of our order. We had missed out on the Jiggs Dinner offered earlier in the week, and the Chicken and Smoked Mozzarella Flatbread were sold out, but there was still plenty of choice among the freshly prepared Thursday/Friday specials, from Mac N Cheese, Turkey Sliders with Guacamole and Jalapeno Havarti, to Chunky Caprese Salad.  To snack on, we selected Corn Chips — a small mountain — with in-house Guac, sour cream and a thick salsa ($10). Lamb Sliders ($18 for six) came with creamy aioli redolent of fresh rosemary: though unclear on the order form, buns were included. The miniburgers were quite tasty and quickly scarfed down.  When ordering we were unsure whether dishes came hot or not. All travelled well in a cooler and had clear reheating instructions where appropriate.  When ordering from an unfamiliar menu, estimating quantities can be tricky. Little Mushroom’s portions were generous, so we ended up eating our Asparagus and Brie Quiche ($16) — the custard light and the pastry crust nicely flaky — over the course of two subsequent meals. A couple from among the selection of dessert Bars and Squares ($6) remained to be taken with afternoon tea, instead of my customary crumpets and jam.  Once they get back to catering, Little Mushroom will continue offering some freezer meals. The dining lounge — with COVID-configured seating for up to 12 diners at six tables — will open as soon as the authorities allow. Jason Hanoski, formerly of Grand Trunk Saloon, will head that kitchen, while Conestoga College hospitality program grad, Dylan McLean, will be general manager.  All our Little Mushroom takeout was excellent value and palpably fresh: Whether to go, or eventually dine-in, their offerings represent a super option for anyone seeking a break from COVID kitchen duties.

My mother would vacuum my room as I lay there, apparently in her way. And my dad would hose off the exterior of my bedroom window as a supposed part of his weekend morning home maintenance routine. The sound of a water jet hitting glass is quite startling, if you were wondering. We have taken a more relaxed approach to parenting around here, although I had a very difficult time not jumping up and down on my daughter’s bed the Saturday morning that we planned to order in brunch from the Korner Kitchen. It was all part of some special mother/daughter time I had been scheduling to try to add a little cheer to the week that should have included her prom.  The two of us had eaten at their appealing new restaurant in Waterloo on what became her last day of high school, and nearly the restaurant’s last day being open for regular business. It felt like coming full circle when I called to put in our order and discovered they were hoping to soon reopen their patio for diners. We are big fans of breakfast in this family and Korner Kitchen has just the menu for us. They also have plenty of lunch items, along with daily specials. I dithered a bit over the menu because I couldn’t decide between sweet and savoury. A day without maple syrup is like a day without sunshine, but I ended up with the best of both worlds when my daughter and I added a Belgian waffle ($8.29) to share as a side. We definitely ordered more than we could eat, but I knew we would enjoy the leftovers. I was very happy with my choice of the Canadian Eggs Benedict ($13.50). It derives its name from the inclusion of pea meal, or Canadian bacon, which is layered with poached egg and melted cheddar cheese, all on top of a toasted English muffin and smothered with delicious Hollandaise sauce. It was tasty and satisfying, and came with two side dishes. The hash brown potatoes at Korner Kitchen are a thing of beauty. The potatoes are grated nice and thin, salted and cooked to crispy perfection. I also had the fruit salad, which was quite large and incorporated two types of melon, three types of berries, bananas, kiwi fruit, pineapple, and grapes. My daughter’s BLT Deluxe Sandwich ($10.50) was so generously sized that the sides of hash brown potatoes and baked beans had to go into a separate container. The sandwich was made with bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, smashed avocado, two fried eggs and garlic mayo, all between toasted whole-wheat bread. She also really enjoyed the hash browns and smaller portion of baked beans. The waffle we shared was light, airy and accompanied by a whipped topping. I added my own maple syrup, of course. The final dish we sampled was the Berry Salad ($16.95). I was looking to add a little fresh greens to our meal and it didn’t disappoint. This salad is a satisfying meal in itself — and came with a grilled breast of chicken on the side. There are plenty of toppings including berries, toasted sliced almonds, pieces of walnut, crumbled goat cheese and I chose a balsamic vinaigrette for my dressing.  Last but not least, we each ordered a Tropical White Herbal Tea ($3.25). I would describe it as having the aroma and flavour of a delicious island-themed cocktail, but in tea form. The other three members of my family are not going to read this review with quite the same enthusiasm as my daughter and I felt eating our brunch, but they can rest assured we will be ordering in again soon from Korner Kitchen. Korner Kitchen 183 Weber St. N., Waterloo 519-578-8555 www.kornerkitchen.ca Hours: Open daily 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Menu: Breakfast, lunch and beverage menus featuring freshly prepared, generously sized traditional breakfast and lunch items, as well as Korner Kitchen specialties.

Pizza? Wings? Battered deep-fried pork balls with gloopy dayglo red sauce? According to Uber Eats, butter chicken topped national doorstep drop-offs during our housebound heyday. While poutine came in second, more naan than fries zipped down our streets and more shawarma than onion rings. The rest of the list — miso soup, pad Thai, bubble tea and edamame — tells a story of how we’re eating now: More than half of us born after the mid-1960s were already used to scrolling and clicking to fill our bellies before March. Also, surveys reveal the younger we are, the more likely we’ll fill our plates with foods our parents and grandparents won’t eat. It seems as our understandings and experiences broaden, so do our palates. A friend and I have a decade-long on-again-off-again conversation about Indian restaurants. I grew up eating the best South Indian food in Waterloo Region — note: my mum’s cooking is the best. That’s not up for debate — while my friend is giddily incandescent about a place that’s … lacking. A few months ago, she shoved a takeout menu for Sahar’s Kitchen into my hand and implored, “This place is so much better. You have to try it. You have to.” It was like she switched from Android to iPhone, Coke to Pepsi, the Leafs to, well, anyone.  Sahar’s Kitchen’s familiar collection of foods hopscotches across the Indian subcontinent. Along with those rooted in Bengali, Chettiar, Goan, Mughlai and Pakistani traditions, others are from the Anglo-Indian canon. With a family story that stretches from Pakistan to Bangladesh to Hong Kong, Majid Maqbool joined his wife, Jhorna, in Kitchener in 2015. Before this, he was cooking at a family restaurant in Hong Kong.  The plan was always to return to the restaurateur life here. Two years ago they opened, naming their restaurant after their now four-year-old daughter — Sahar means dawn’s light. Here, the couple, along with Mian Maqbool Sabry (Majid’s father), turn out some fine dishes from the cosy restaurant’s kitchen.  Unlidding containers reveals complex aromas and flavours buoyed by texture and colour. Rivulets of brick red oils swirl atop luscious crimson and russet gravies. Spices speckle pallid sweet sauces. Textures wander from firm to sticky to voluptuously soft. The Butter Chicken’s ($15.99) chunks of breast meat are tender and swathed in a rounded, rich, tomato gravy. Unlike the tinned tomato soupiness that’s sometimes found elsewhere, its light sweetness doesn’t overpower. The King Prawn Chettinad ($17.99) is punchy with a pleasantly creeping heat that doesn’t overpower. The gravy’s depth is boosted from the firm tail-on shrimp — here, the gravy is to be sopped up.  For okra fans, the Bhindi Bhaji ($14.99) combines firm and slippery chunks with slithers of silky onion, fried in mild spices. There’s a mild tang to the Bharta’s ($14.99) soft mash of grilled eggplant from the tomato masala.  Mixing the wet and dry dishes into the nutty, aromatic Basmati ($3.99), jeera rice flecked with grains of saffron rice, brings everything together. The soft, bubbly Garlic Naan ($3.99) — blistered from the tandoor and scattered with chopped garlic and coriander — is perfect for sopping up puddles of gravy. Soaked in sweetened rosewater-scented cream, the Rasmalai’s ($2.99) cheesecake-like paneer is moreish. And whether you call it kheer, payasam or Rice Pudding ($2.99), the loose, butter yellow pudding is flavoured with cardamom and studded with cashews. Both are needed desserts for hot nights. There was a well-spaced queue of customers and delivery drivers spilling onto the sidewalk when I picked up dinner. Business has been steady throughout COVID-19 and I can see why.

105,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/life/food-wine/review/2020/06/11/dining-in-gayuma-catering-serves-asian-fusion-from-the-heart.html,Dining In: Gayuma Catering serves Asian fusion from the heart,['Alex Bielak'],"Thu., June 11, 2020","Given the positive online buzz about Gayuma Catering’s takeout Asian fusion dishes, and how fast they sold out, I was delighted when I finally successfully placed an order. Everything about the place seemed happy, from the jaunty logo, incorporating chopsticks and noodles into the letter G, to the upbeat social media posts, often featuring the radiant owners.  Katrina Tioco came from the Philippines in 2006 as a caregiver, and still has family there she supports financially. She eventually worked as a nanny for Canadian-born Jinny Song, whose ancestry is South Korean. That’s how Song came to appreciate just how good a cook Tioco is.  Two years ago, Song convinced Tioco to do some food pop-ups at the bubble tea shop she manages. She was certain people would love her now-friend’s cooking, saying “I really wanted to get her food out there. She never believed in herself, but I did. She’s the sister I never had.”  Not long thereafter, they started Gayuma, originally catering to tech sector companies. With corporate offices closed because of COVID-19, they lost all their clients. “We still had family to support and rent to pay, so we changed our business model very quickly, beginning with a Facebook post. It was slow in the beginning: the first week we had just 10 orders, but it grew each week and we are now at capacity every weekend. We are so grateful. In a way, it was a blessing in disguise.”  Tioco says her grandfather served as the inspiration for the name Gayuma. During the ’60s, impatient customers lined up at his restaurant, pressing him to tell them what made his food so special and worth the wait. He told them he cooked everything from scratch, with all his heart, and that was why they were there. The Filipino word Gayuma, “that which attracts,” encapsulated his offerings.  She says that is the way she cooks now. “I can’t speed it up, and people are so patient with me. I decide what to cook once I’m at the grocery store. And I’ve had to accommodate all sorts of allergies, so have had to find alternative ingredients that can work in the dishes to substitute for things like peanuts. Guided by her grandmother during Facebook chats, she’s found various Asian herbs and seeds that can serve as replacements, while keeping the dishes tasting right.”  Dodging summer downpours, I picked up my order at the back of a small strip mall off Weber Street. A small sign by a nondescript door directed me to call to get my order. Once the door opened, there, above the masks, were those same smiling eyes I had seen on Facebook. I was the last client of the day, so the ladies had time to chat before closing.  Tioco’s actual sister — another radiant smile beaming from the back of the store — was responsible for folding each of the 20 dumplings that comprised part of our order. Half beef, half pork, with garlic, shallots, salt and pepper, they were delicious in Tioco’s signature, a beautifully clear and garlicky, 48-hour chicken soup. The accompanying ginger soy sauce also provided contrasting flavour.  Song told me that Chap Chae is a sweet potato glass noodle Korean dish, more savoury than spicy. She said Tioco makes it better than she can, adding the highest of praise, “it’s like my mother’s.” The ground beef was marinated overnight with sesame oil, soya sauce, brown sugar, crushed garlic and pepper, before being sautéed with green onion and added to the noodles. A small container of brought-in Sriracha allowed for a bit of heat for those so inclined. I could frankly have done with the protein being a bit more prominent among the other ingredients — peppers, carrot, shiitake mushrooms, spinach and sesame seeds — but that is the merest of quibbles.  The copious and truly satisfying meal — consciously made affordable by Tioco and Song to give back to the community during COVID — was most enjoyable. Everyone was keen to order again, and I’ll certainly be watching out for what is on offer each week, and for what the future holds for these joyful entrepreneurs.

Weeding is a lonely pursuit but back in the day I did have young assistants, whether willing or not. The middle child once said we were fighting Sir Weedy and his evil henchmen.  My husband noted that this year I am showing extra aggression in my assault on Sir Weedy. His point is valid, but I would describe my methods as therapeutic. It’s a healthy outlet for stress. For your safety, however, do not approach during one of my sessions. One works up quite a thirst and appetite after all that hard work, especially on a Friday night. Some of us were craving chicken wings and we knew just the right spot.  Morty’s Pub in Waterloo is conveniently located near our two universities but its popularity extends well beyond the student population. For nearly 40 years the casual eatery has been a local favourite for its house specialty wings, frosty beverages, and friendly, welcoming atmosphere. They’ve cleverly embraced the new rules regarding alcohol and include beer and wings specials, along with a whole array of tempting takeout options, from their menu. Unlike prior Friday night escapades, which involved debate and discussion over what to order, the four of us made our choices lickety split. Morty’s online ordering system is very straightforward and sets out payment and pickup methods designed to be contact-free. If alcohol is part of the order, proof of age must be provided at the time of pickup. Alcohol can’t be included if you opt to have your order delivered.  Friday nights at Morty’s are especially festive, as my husband and eldest son discovered when they arrived in the parking lot to pick up our food. Their server was decked out in a grass skirt and flowery lei in honour of the occasion. There’s a different theme every week, so prepare to be surprised. Everything in our order was neatly packaged and labelled for ease of distribution. The starters we ordered to share were apparently irresistible. By the time I had finished taking the photos to go with this review, the others had graciously left me one of the Pickle Spears ($11.99) to try, which left me wanting more. Fried pickles are pretty straightforward but when they’re done right they’re really tasty. These were crisp spears of dill pickle coated in just the right amount of breading and paired with a garlicky sauce. I fared better with the Spinach Dip ($13.49) and toasted pita triangles for dipping. There was plenty of the creamy spinach, artichoke, Asiago and feta cheese mixture for all to enjoy. It is meant to be served hot, so it can be popped in the microwave if needed.  My son and husband each ordered medium-sized Famous Chicken Wings ($24.99, includes one or two sauces). Both opted for the smoked unbreaded style, but one went with Cajun sauce and the other with Hot. The wings were very enjoyable and the level of heat was to their taste. We also shared a tasty Basket O’Fries ($6.99), which contained more than enough for everyone.  My daughter chose the Chicken Chunks ($13.49) in Honey Garlic. It was a generous portion and there was enough left over to share for lunch the next day.  I also had leftovers from my Morty’s Steak Sandwich ($15.99) but I carefully hid them in the fridge. That sandwich was delicious with layers of flank steak, mozzarella cheese, sautéed onion, mushrooms and green pepper. Some beef sandwiches cry out for a gravy or dip but this one stood up on its own. Morty’s has everything you need to celebrate the start of summer from the comfort and safety of your own patio. Morty’s Pub 272 King St. N., Waterloo 519-886-0440 www.mortys.com Hours: Wednesdays to Sundays: noon to 9 p.m., accepting orders until 8:30 p.m. Menu: Morty’s offers a wide array of pub grub, including appetizers, wings, sandwiches, burgers, soft drinks, and wine, liquor and beer with an order of food. Dessert is ice cream from Four All, and they also have bottles of hot sauce for the adventurous. Payment: Credit card payment made at time of order. Cash payments will not be accepted. How to get your food: You can order directly from the restaurant on their website or by phone for curbside pickup, and for delivery through Skip The Dishes. The bill: $126.48 (including tax but not tip) for one Pickle Spears, one Artichoke Dip, one Chicken Chunks, two medium Famous Chicken Wings, one Basket O’ Fries and one Morty’s Steak Sandwich.

107,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/life/food-wine/2020/05/28/dining-in-tasty-italian-dishes-for-your-casa-from-casa-rugantino.html,"Dining In: Tasty Italian dishes for your casa, from Casa Rugantino",['Jasmine Mangalaseril'],"Thu., May 28, 2020","Summer thumped down on us, bringing hot temperatures, blazing sunshine and cerulean skies (and perhaps a few spots of rain). I’m sure some think this is Mother Nature brazenly taunting us into old habits: throwing backyard parties, unfurling picnic blankets in the park, staking out territory on the beach. But today, on March the sixty-thirteenth, those innocuous habits of The Beforetimes seem hedonistic. As we dip our toes into reopening the economy, we’ll continue to take the precautions we need to protect ourselves and others. Along with that, many of us will keep supporting those doing their best to keep things going in our community — front-line workers, shops and restaurants as they navigate still uncertain waters. About nine years ago, Shelly Trotta purchased Casa Rugantino, building on the Belmont Village restaurant’s reputation as a family-run spot serving good Italian food. Since temporarily closing the dining room, she refocussed the neighbourhood trattoria business to offer preordered pickup, mostly from their already established menu. Same-day orders must be called in by noon, with pickup times from 4 to 7 p.m. You can pay in advance with Visa or Mastercard or on-site with debit.  Their menu lists a good selection of favourites (as available) — pasta, pizza, seafood, baked and braised dishes. There’s good choice for those wanting vegetarian meals, with some pasta dishes — the lasagna and baked penne — offering meat and nonmeat versions. They’ve also got a dessert that changes weekly. If you want a bottle of wine, you can select one from their list. Their family takeout dinner (lasagna or baked penne and either Caesar or house salad, $80) feeds four to six. Our order is pretty much ready when I arrive, and comes with a clutch of small, soft rolls. The containers highlight two signature recipes, received from previous owners, that made Casa Rugantino a favourite for more than 40 years: the marinara and meat sauces balance sweet, savoury and sharp tomatoey flavours; the third staple recipe is their pizza dough. Good ingredients get turned into more than generous portions, all dusted with Parmesan.  The Arancini ($11.95), an ample starter of three with marinara sauce and a side of rocket, is a good dinner for small eaters. Each rice ball is a handful, dusted in seasoned fine bread crumb, pan-fried and baked. Granted, they steamed on the way home, but they’re still toothsome with savoury al dente rice, the accompanying bitter leaves and the just tangy-enough sauce. I licked the plate. You’d do the same. Yes, you would. The Lasagna (meat, $16.50) container suffered a bit on the ride home due to some hard braking. But sliding layers don’t diminish its taste or texture. Made fresh-to-order, the dappled cheese top blankets sheets of Vincenzo’s pasta, tender beef, and sauce. I reheated it a titch so its gooey, melty mozzarella web pulls with each forkful. It’s a good, comforting plate. The Eggplant Parmigiana ($25.95) is a hearty meal, particularly when you add a small Caesar Salad and a side of Baked Pasta. Torn, crisp romaine is lightly dressed in house-made Caesar dressing and topped with good, chunky croutons. The baked pasta is firm to the tooth and swathed in meat sauce (it can be made with plain marinara). The eggplant — peeled, thick slices that are sautéed, baked and tender to the tooth — is nicely sauced and covered with burnished and stretchy mozzarella. Since closing Casa Rugantino’s dining room, Trotta says the community has been overwhelming in support for their neighbourhood spot. At first, many came for pizza, but now they’re diving into the rest of the menu. And why not? It’s all delicious here. Reheats: Since Dining In began, a couple of local resources have been created listing local restaurants operating during the pandemic.  The City of Kitchener has created a Google Map that lists restaurants and grocery stores offering curbside pickup in Kitchener, Waterloo, and Cambridge at https://bit.ly/3d2JV74.

108,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/entertainment/music/2020/06/02/kitchener-waterloo-symphony-streams-pre-recorded-concerts-through-the-pandemic.html,Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony streams pre-recorded concerts through the pandemic,['Terry Pender'],"Tue., June 2, 2020","WATERLOO REGION — The Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony is attracting larger audiences during the COVID-19 pandemic than at any other time in its history. Up to 5,000 people a week are enjoying concerts streamed online every Friday at 8 p.m. on the symphony’s Facebook page and YouTube channel. Normally, the KWS Signature Series attracts about 1,000 people to a concert at Centre in the Square. Attendance can vary significantly for symphony concerts. Performances of iconic works, such as Beethoven’s Ninth Sympny or Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, will sell out and attract 2,000 to both the Friday and Saturday night concerts. So, 4,000 people over two nights is the capacity. With the move to online broadcasts of recorded concerts, the KWS is reaching more people than ever.  “We have pivoted,” said Andrew Bennett, the symphony’s executive director. That data shows the overwhelming majority of the online audiences stick around for the entire performance.  For the first two weeks the symphony streamed audio and video. Now, it is audio only. When a symphony concert is streaming on Facebook some of the musicians are chatting on the platform about the show, and interacting with audiences. After Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony was streamed, there was a gathering of musicians and fans on Zoom. “So you actually get to do things you normally wouldn’t get to do during a concert,” said Bennett. The symphony will continue to stream concerts at no charge during the pandemic shutdown. It helps the symphony stay in contact with its loyal base of fans, and reach new ones. People as far away as the U.K. have watched the concerts. “It’s great for the organization to have this exposure,” said Bennett. “It’s a fantastic opportunity for people to hear how good the orchestra is.”  The players, conductors, guest soloists, symphony management and the Candian Federation of Musicians had to agree to provide the material online for free. The demonstrated success of the streaming does not mean the KWS is going to take the next step when the pandemic is over, and allow audience members to record short videos of the orchestra on their smartphones during a performance and post that to social media.  The internet is one of the most powerful tools for promoting events and growing audiences, but the contract between the symphony and the musicians’ union forbids the sharing of digital content, even by an audience member using a smartphone. It is the same for every unionized orchestra across Canada, said Katherine Carleton, the executive director of Orchestras Canada. The union and some symphonies in the U.S. have agreed to allow audience members to take short videos on their phones, and post that content online, for some shows, she said. “There is a little bit more flexibility in the U.S. than there is in Canada,” said Bennett. “It is an interesting and ongoing conversation.” When content is captured on a smartphone, and shared on social media, the only ones making money on it are the digital platforms, not the musicians and not their symphonies, said Bennett. Orchestras Canada, which represents 130 orchestras, does not take a position on the issue. It is up to the musician’s federation and the orchestras to negotiate the collective agreements. Paul Mitchell, the head of the Central Ontario Musicians’ Association, said allowing audience members to record short segments of a concert on their smartphone and share that online would distract other audience members. “You are opening Pandora’s Box there,” said Mitchell. Under the terms of the union contract, only the musicians’ association can make recordings of the orchestra and it retains control of the recordings. No part of a concert can be recorded or reproduced and then transmitted from the concert hall by anyone without a specific written agreement with the Canadian Federation of Musicians, said Mitchell. And that definitely covers audience members who want to make short videos with their smartphones and post that online. The clause is there because the union believes symphony musicians should always be paid for the music they create, said Mitchell. “As soon as you let the general public do whatever they want, the bottom falls out of the market,” said Mitchell.  Short snippets of a symphony concert posted online could be grabbed by other parties and included in something that is making money, and the musicians would never see a dime, he said. “You miss out on the revenue stream for something you created,” said Mitchell. “Everybody should get paid again, and it’s not out of greed, it’s because they created it and somebody else is making money from it again.” So far the KWS has streamed six pre-recorded concerts. The musicians are also producing other digital content during the pandemic shutdown as well.  When the pandemic hit, the symphony management and board of directors decided not to lay off anyone. That decision, and the fact the KWS treats its musicians as employees, means they qualify for a 75 per cent wage subsidy from Ottawa. “We are the luckiest,” said Larry Larson, the KWS principal trumpet. About half of the members of Orchestra Canada treat their musicians as employees. The others treat musicians as independent contractors. The wage subsidy is an economic life line for the musicians. Larson lost his regular gig at the Stratford Festival where he plays the fanfare at the main theatre before the plays. He was also going to play in the orchestra for the festival’s production of “Spamalot.” All of that was lost with the pandemic shutdown. “It’s just a bizarre, bizarre time, for sure,” said Larson. He credits the KWS management and board for keeping everyone on the payroll. They made that decision even before Ottawa announced the wage subsidy program. When the summer comes, the KWS musicians will apply for Employment Insurance. “What do you do? You throw up your hands and you say: ‘There is nothing can be done except try to stay self-motivated as an artist, keep honing your skills through all of this, and know that some day performances will be back,” said Larson."
109,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/entertainment/music/2020/05/22/the-reklaws-using-pandemic-downtime-to-write-more-songs.html,The Reklaws using pandemic downtime to write more songs,['Terry Pender'],"Fri., May 22, 2020","WATERLOO REGION — Stuart and Jenna Walker — known to millions of fans as The Reklaws — are busy writing songs during the COVID-19 shutdown and expect to release new material this summer. “I never thought we would see anything like this, this is just crazy,” said Stuart of the pandemic that’s killed live music shows probably until a vaccine is available. The brother-and-sister country music sensation from Cambridge had planned to be in Nashville for the entire month of May for an intense round of songwriting with producers and lyricists. Now, they are doing that via Zoom from their homes in Toronto. “People are learning to get by with Zoom calls and the songs are just as good, so we are like: ‘OK, this is what we are doing for a while,’ but it seems to be working, so that’s good,” said Jenna. The Reklaws had a full calendar of shows booked for 2020 but then the pandemic hit and everything was shut down. The reopening of some retail stores, parks, marinas and golf courses in no way signals a return to live music. The magic of live shows absolutely requires a venue packed with fans. And that will not be allowed until a vaccine is available.  But The Reklaws are as upbeat about it as their music. They exploded onto the country music scene in 2017 with their song “Hometown Kids.” In less than three years fans streamed their songs more than 33 million times, they garnered a Juno nomination, released am EP and performed all over North America. “Things were moving so quickly we were kind of taking things for granted for a while,” said Jenna. The pause is unexpected, but also welcome. They spent the Victoria Day long weekend at their cottage near Sauble Beach. They have been going to that cottage for 20 years this summer. These days they live near one another in Toronto and get together for regular songwriting sessions. “It’s time we can use for songwriting, and just getting our things in order for when it starts up again because it is going to be wild when it does,” said Jenna. They each bring 10 to 20 ideas to a songwriting session, written on their smartphones or laptops. They pitch those ideas to hotshot lyricists and producers in Nashville during Zoom calls. “Titles and ideas, whatever,” said Jenna. “Exactly — it could be a word, it could be an entire chorus written out,” said Stuart. “If people are into it that’s great, if not then you take it with a grain of salt and carry on.” Their creative method is working music industry wonders. The 2018 single “Long Live the Night” went Gold and was streamed more than any other Canadian country song that year. The Canadian Football League used it as a theme song for weekly television broadcasts. “We go in with titles and we do like to write to tracks,” said Stuart. “So, if there is a producer or track guy in that day, we hope that he has a beat ready to go, and we try to write to that and see what the vibe is of everybody in the room.” Signed to Universal Music, their story is like something straight out of the movies. They went from their hometown of Cambridge to festivals and venues around the continent. Already successful, they are touted as the next country music superstars. “We are just going to try and stay in a creative space, keep on writing and stay positive in every way we can,” said Stuart.  No surprise there. Their music is not the sad twang of lonely hearts, cheating wives, lost farms and dead dogs. The Reklaws are joyous and celebratory. “I think we are lucky as artists. We have a fan base that is pretty strong. They know it’s not over. They know we are going to come back even bigger,” said Jenna. Human trials of three different vaccines are underway in Canada, England and the U.S. There is a prototype of one vaccine that has already protected lab monkeys from COVID-19. It will take a vaccine to save the live music business. “That means the world to us,” said Jenna. “We are going to get stuff in order in terms of songwriting. It’s funny, when we are running and we are playing shows we run out of time to get everything else together. And when we do go to song-write it kind of feels like we are flying by the seat-of-our pants and just trying to keep up.” Stuart believes the pandemic shutdown is a test of every single musician. And while he and Jenna like the interaction with individual fans that happens during online shows, there is nothing like a venue packed with loud, appreciative fans dancing to the music. “I think the place we thrive the most is live, onstage, before a crowd,” said Stuart. “The online shows are a different set up than that, but we have been doing a lot of them and it has been good so far.” New songs will be released this summer, material that was recorded in Nashville before the shutdown. They will do as many online shows as possible to connect with fans.  “We can’t look at it negatively because the whole world looks at it negatively,” said Jenna. “When the vaccine is here, we can all have a big party.”"
110,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/entertainment/music/2020/05/15/musicians-releasing-new-cds-with-no-live-shows.html,Local musicians releasing new CDs without the payoff of live shows,['Terry Pender'],"Fri., May 15, 2020","WATERLOO REGION — A unique celebration of the region’s musical talent — spearheaded by the prolific singer-songwriter Lynn Jackson — is on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Next Saturday, Jackson had planned a CD release party at the Starlight in Waterloo. Every track on her new CD — “Lionheart” — includes some of the area’s top musicians. It took months to get everyone’s schedule synchronized for the show, only to see it cancelled. But she is releasing the CD as planned on May 22 anyway. She wrote and produced all but one of the songs on her 11th CD. But because of the number of musical guests, Jackson describes it as a community project. “I really took care to get players I really wanted on each song, and how I wanted each song presented,” said Jackson. “Sometimes I had to wait a couple of months for someone to be free, but I was really patient.” There are 12 musical guests, including — Don Featherstone (sax) Chris Boyne (electribe), Rob Deyman (guitar), John Stuart (guitar), Silvia DiDonato (keys), Jonny Sauder (drums), Scott Fitzpatrick (bass), The Divines (Wendy Carraro, Emily Barkley and Danica Guenette), Allison Corbett (violin) and Wendy Wright (violin). All of them are busy, gigging musicians so a CD launch party was scheduled for May 23 at the Starlight in Waterloo — the first date when everyone could perform together. Then the pandemic hit. Writing the songs, recording the material and packaging her new CD took more than a year of work. Now, with the closure of all live music venues, it feels like there is a big hole in the creative process. “It’s like you haven’t completed a cycle,” said Jackson. “Part of the reward of that cycle is to have a big show, a bunch of people come out, you get feedback, release the album and then go on tour. That whole process is now stunted and you don’t quite get the same feeling of satisfaction.” Her new music, however, is deeply satisfying, and includes a beautiful tribute to Leonard Cohen. Jackson was performing the night of Nov. 7, 2016, when she heard Cohen had died. “Then I came home and started playing Leonard Cohen albums in my studio space,” said Jackson. “I opened some wine, I was just really mourning, and all of a sudden the tears started to flow.” She grabbed a pen and paper and wrote the first verse of what would become “The Sound of Everything (for Leonard Cohen).” After that first verse the lyrics came quickly. When she returned to them a couple of months later, Jackson made only two small changes. “Those lyrics are what came out at that moment,” she said. It sounds like something Cohen would have loved — a mournful and beautiful remembrance with Featherstone on baritone sax and Boyne on Electribe.  “Lionheart” will be released on Busted Flat Records. The only cover is “Working Class Hero,” by John Lennon. With Corbett and Wright both playing violins on this track, Jackson’s cover is unlike any other.  “We did three takes and chose the best one, nice and simple,” said Jackson. Not only is the CD launch party cancelled, Jackson had shows booked for Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton that were also scrapped. So, the CD is available at www.bustedflatrecords.com or www.encorerecords.ca or from lynnjackson.bandcamp.com. Kitchener’s Matt Weidinger knows what it’s like to release a CD when all the venues are closed. He released “Breakage” on May 1, which has nine tracks. Eight are original songs, and one is a cover of Led Zeppelin’s “Going to California.”  Weidinger played guitar on all tracks, and added keys in later. Ben Rollo is on drums and Mark McIntyre plays bass. “We just wanted to get that live feeling, so we just set up in a studio in Toronto, played through the songs a bunch, we picked the best take and then I would start adding stuff onto it,” said Weidinger.  He wrote the material during the first half of 2019. He had CD release shows booked in Ancaster, London, Toronto, Collingwood, Stratford, Kitchener and the Starlight in Waterloo. All of the shows have had to be postponed. “I am tyring to think about how it is possible to do something without having those live shows,” said Weidinger. “It has been tough trying to get my head around that.” Musicians depend on the magic of live performances, when the emotional connections with audiences produce CD sales. Weidinger’s new CD is available on Bandcamp, which is a platform he likes a lot. “They really do support the artists,” he said. When listing the new CD on Bandcamp, Weidinger set the price at $20. But there is also an option to pay more to support the artist, and Bandcamp does not take any of that money. “I’ve had people be very generous and say: ‘Hey, I know you are not working so we are going to give you a little extra for that,’” said Weidinger. During the shutdown Weidinger said he is learning the art of recording. That’s a good way to spend his time during the pandemic because he has his own label. “It is along the lines of that goal, making my own sound, putting my own stamp on the music,” said Weidinger. “If I can learn how to record my own albums from home, in my own studio, I will be able to put material out more frequently and save myself a lot of money.”"

The large window on her right floods the studio behind her family home in Old Westmount with natural light, and a humming electric motor spins the potter's wheel. Donaldson's hands bring to life a piece of clay about the size of a big orange. Potters call this ""throwing the clay."" She is making a teapot — the biggest challenge for a potter. But Donaldson is at the peak of her creative skills. There's no hesitation as the clay glistens with moisture and constantly changes shape with her expert touch. She pushes the clay down onto the spinning wheel, pulls it up and widens it out. ""I can only do the claw-grip thing once, then it gets too tall. So now I am doing what are called side-pulls,"" says Donaldson. ""So, I've got some fingers on the outside and some fingers on the inside, and I am just pulling more or less straight up, and I stop before I get to the top."" Clay gathers on her fingers, so she is constantly rinsing them in a bowl of water next to the wheel. She is so neat in her work she does not wear an apron. Her hands are almost always touching, supporting one another as she works the clay. ""If they are braced on each other, it is just much more stable,"" says Donaldson. She keeps her fingers wet, and the walls of the pot dry. Dry patches can cause the pot to twist, and water in the bottom can cause cracks later on. She wants the base and the opening at the top about three inches wide. At the right time, she checks the thickness of the bottom with a needle. There is a lot going on. And like most experts, Donaldson makes it look easy. The sound of the motor drops as the wheel slows. ""As the pot gets bigger and thinner, it gets a little more vulnerable to distortion, so I just like to work a bit more slowly,"" she says. After about 30 minutes, there is a pot sitting on the wheel. She pulls a wire through the base and lifts it up. Then she turns her attention to the lid, and the spout. She will make both out of the same piece of clay in what's called ""throwing the hump."" It takes about 15 minutes to make the lid. It needs a collar that slips into the opening of the pot so it does not slide off when tea is poured. It needs a knob, sized correctly for the fingers. And it has to be the right width. Again, there is a lot going on. But the clay quickly responds to her touch and a lid emerges from the clump of clay. ""It's so neat. I smile every time I do that. I look at it and say: 'That's so cool,' "" says Donaldson. She uses the wire to cut through the clay again and lifts the lid from the wheel. Now, she makes the spout, which might be the trickiest part of throwing a teapot. No matter how good every other part looks, a poorly made spout will dribble liquid. ""You want it to pour like a dream,"" says Donaldson as her fingers shape the clay into a curved cylinder with a wide base and a narrow opening. She removes the spout from the wheel and lays it on the table to dry with the lid, pot and handle. The handle was actually made first. After the clay is cut and weighed, she kneads it to ensure it is homogenous and smooth. Holding a dry bunch in her left hand above a bowl of water, Donaldson pulls down on the clay. She keeps her hand wet and shapes the tapered clay into a handle. ""Yeah, it is very complex. It's why the teapot is considered the masterpiece of the potter, and why there are lots of not-very-good teapots around,"" says Donaldson. ""They are tricky to make, and a lot of people don't really make much of a study of it. Or if you haven't been doing it for very long, you just haven't noticed the way you can make it better."" On a nearby table are three teapots that won the Craft Ontario Best in Show Award. Beautiful, well-designed teapots take so long to make it is difficult to turn a profit. She does it for the love of crafting a beautiful object. And while she sells some for about $150 each, she donates more to charity auctions. Donaldson's pots often fetch $350 and more at auction.  Teapots are the great love of Donaldson's creative life. However, when it comes to earning money, she looks to her Christmas trees. Donaldson makes about 450 Christmas trees a year and she sells every one. Over the past 25 years she's made thousands. ""They account for a large part of my income in the fall,"" she says. ""In November that's two-thirds of my income just in the tree sales."" It started when her sons, now in their 30s, were in elementary school. She developed the Christmas trees as projects that could easily be done by young students. Every year she volunteered to lead a pottery class in her sons' school. ""I supply bristol board cones that I made years ago as a temporary support. The students roll a small slab and make a pie shaped impression on it with a template. They cut it out and wrap it around the cone and seal it, then they make the balls and apply them to the cone to make the tree,"" says Donaldson. Structurally, the cone is strong and easy to make so children didn't ruin the shape while working on it. The kids rolled little bits of clay into balls and put them on the cones for boughs. ""It was a popular project for kids' classes, really popular,"" Donaldson says. ""And I heard sometimes from mothers, how much they liked it, and they had it sitting out as decor, something their eight-year-old made."" So she made some for the annual sales organized by the Waterloo Potters' Workshop and the Hamilton Potters' Guild. ""I would just sell out whenever I took them to sales, and they still come close to selling out even if I take loads of them,"" says Donaldson. She listens to the chatter of holiday shoppers around her table during November sales. Some people return every year to buy one or more trees. They send Donaldson pictures of the trees in their nativity scenes at home. ""And some people say: 'Oh, I've got a whole forest at home, ' "" says Donaldson. She makes a lot of Christmas trees in the dead of winter. After preparing for the big sales in November and December and celebrating Christmas with her family, making the trees in the new year is deeply relaxing, even cathartic. She listens to audio books while making the trees in several sizes and colours. ""And then I know that I have a few dozen of them made, and I am not trying to crunch through in the fall in time for November,"" she says.  Donaldson's fascination with pottery began when she was 16 years old. Friends of her parents came to the family cottage on Georgian Bay bearing a gift — a teapot and cups made by Bracebridge potter Jon Partridge. The young Donaldson could not stop looking at the pot, holding it up and slowly moving it around. Donaldson says she was mesmerized by the beautiful, handmade object. She still has it in her home. ""It was like I had been struck by lightning,"" says Donaldson. From that moment on, she wanted to be a potter. She started taking courses to prepare for college studies in ceramics and pottery. The Ontario College of Art (now OCAD University) said she was qualified, but it had no ceramics program. She would have to study sculpture and learn to use different materials. There was a potter's wheel under a table in one of the studios. She was welcome to use it but would have to teach herself. Then she considered a budding ceramics program at Sheridan College. It was a good one, but when they heard she was fascinated by teapots they recommended she study under Roger Kerslake at Georgian College in Barrie. Kerslake is famous for his teapots, and Georgian College is halfway between the family home in Toronto and her family's beloved cottage. She jumped at the chance. After finishing the three-year program in ceramics and glass, she moved to Waterloo to be with her husband, Ron. They relocated to Calgary in 1984, and Donaldson worked briefly out of a production studio called the Clay House. After returning to Waterloo in 1989 she worked in the basement, and when they moved into their current house in 2007, on Claremont Avenue in Kitchener, she built a potter's studio in a shed behind the house. Donaldson's teen years not only introduced her to pottery, but also helped form her business practices. Toronto born and raised, Donaldson spent summers at the cottage and helped out in her family's ski shop. Her sister eventually took over the family business in Toronto. Donaldson and her husband took over the cottage. They continue to spend lots of time there. That retail experience taught her valuable lessons about tracking her sales and commissions. She keeps detailed records. ""I know how many I have sold at the sale previous, and whether they have sold out, and whether they sold out on the Friday night of a three-day sale, that kind of thing,"" Donaldson says. ""So then when I try to make more and take more, I try to be organized about it."" She also has a notebook that records every order she's had since starting out as a potter in 1983. Decades after her studies at Georgian College, Donaldson and her former teacher, Roger Kerslake, met again at the opening of a retrospective show of Kerslake's work at the Jonathon Bancroft-Snell Gallery in London, Ont. As a former student, Donaldson was invited to contribute a piece. Her teapot sold before his, Kerslake remembers with a laugh. In an interview, he describes his former student as nice, determined and hard-working, and was not surprised by her fascination with teapots. ""It's a real challenge to make a good teapot,"" Kerslake says. ""It's one of my favourite things to make."" The balance, the form and the demands of perfectly melding several parts into something practical and beautiful takes real talent, he says. ""Either the handle isn't on straight, or the lid falls off, or the spout isn't at the right angle, so therefore it drips or runs down the side,"" he says. ""There are so many different things."" ""It is one of the most difficult forms to pull off,"" agrees Janna Hiemstra, the executive director of Craft Ontario. ""You have to know what you are doing to be able to pull off a teapot,"" Hiemstra says. ""I challenge anybody to try making one. There are not many people with that skill."" Craft Ontario awarded Donaldson the John and Barbara Mather Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2005. ""It is the most prestigious award we give out in the craft community in Ontario,"" Hiemstra says. It is given for outstanding work in support of that community. Donaldson organized conferences, auctions, exhibitions, wrote technical articles about ceramics, reviewed workshops, lectures and special exhibitions. She is a long-standing member of the Waterloo Potters' Workshop and volunteers at the Canadian Clay and Glass Gallery where she is a former board member. She's exhibited at the Clay and Glass Gallery and the Burlington Arts Centre. ""She is really well known in Ontario not only as a ceramic artist, but somebody who has actively worked to make sure the profile for craft is built in the province,"" Hiemstra says.  The shelves on one wall of Donaldson's studio are crowded with cups, bowls, garlic holders, platters, maple syrup containers, butter dishes, coffee mugs, citrus juicers, commemorative baby dishes with the children's name, plates and teapots. In addition to the everyday objects, there are beautiful, unique containers shaped like peppers or big seed pods. These are decorated with white leaves against a dark, smoky background. Her studio is redolent with aroma of roasting coffee beans. Donaldson's husband, Ron, roasts his own beans, and she uses the chaff from those beans for a smoke-firing technique that has won awards. She takes fresh leaves from a plant in her garden. The leaves are held to the outside of the porcelain jar with a thin cotton cord. She covers the bottom of a tinfoil bag with the chaff from the beans in the coffee roaster. She puts the pepper-shaped container with the leaves tied in place into the foil bag and closes it up. The bag then goes into the kiln. The smoke from the chaff colours the peppers, but the moisture from the leaves creates a pattern on the outside. ""That's how the magic is made,"" she says. She won the Primitive Firing Award for that in several juried shows.  At this moment, Donaldson is looking at her would-be teapot – the pot, handle, lid and spout – on her work table. After 24 hours of drying under plastic and cloth, the parts are ready for final assembly. She places the pot on a stainless-steel pedestal that she easily spins with one hand. The pedestal was a Christmas gift from her husband when they lived in Calgary 35 years ago. She uses a small tool to trim extra clay. She uses another tool to punch small holes through the side of the pot where the base of the spout will be attached. Another tool furrows the surface of the smooth clay. Then she applies ""slip,"" a mixture of clay and water, to that area. Gently but firmly, she presses the base of the spout to the pot. It stays in place. Just three years ago, she learned a great trick to create an elegant bend in the tip of the spout to finish the opening and prevent dribbles. She pulls a wire back through the centre of the cylinder from the opening for a short distance and then pulls down the lower half. She smooths over the cuts with her fingers. She attaches the handle after scoring the surface and once again applying ""slip."" The lid is also trimmed and drops neatly into the opening at the top of the pot. She slowly rotates the teapot and looks at her work with an expert eye. ""A lot of us feel this is the most beautiful stage. The clay seems alive, it kind of glows, it is a lot like skin now, it has a bit of moisture, a coolness to it, it's nice and smooth,"" says Donaldson. ""I often photograph my work at this stage."" The teapot must be fired twice in the kiln. The first is called the bisque firing that dries and hardens the clay. The teapot is then cleaned, covered in glaze and fired again in the kiln. ""And hopefully you get something that thrills you again,"" says Donaldson. This article appears in the November-December edition of Grand magazine."

Watson was born in Ontario, received her undergraduate degree in British Columbia then moved to the United Kingdom where she completed a master of arts degree in maritime archeology from the University of Southampton. She has no known familial links to the artist Homer Watson, in whose former home the gallery is located. Watson most recently worked as senior house steward at Wimpole Estate, National Trust, in Cambridgeshire, England. Her job entailed co-ordinating exhibitions while also caring for the historic buildings and its collections. She previously worked at several museums and galleries, including the National Maritime Museum in London, the Royal Tyrell Museum in Alberta and the Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives."
113,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/entertainment/art/2019/09/16/artists-among-us-cambridge-artist-finds-inspiration-in-lake-erie-town.html,Artists Among Us: Cambridge artist finds inspiration in Lake Erie town,"['Valerie Hill', 'Waterloo Region Record']","Mon., Sept. 16, 2019","Cambridge artist and musician Shauna Proctor had an idea for a gallery/café and she wanted it located in a unique place, an inspiring place far from the bustle of Waterloo Region.  Her first choice was Port Dover, the lovely but expensive town on the shores of Lake Erie.  The building she had her eye on sold before she had a chance to put her foot in the front door. Big disappointment. Then a real estate agent suggested the village of Port Rowan, west of Port Dover, a place rather sleepy and consequently lacking the traffic and hoopla of the larger town, though thousands of tourists do visit every year. It was 2017 and Proctor was excited when she first walked through the building, located on the main drag overlooking the harbour.  It had the right bones, a big backyard and enough space for an art gallery, retail shop and café, plus a little spot for a performance stage.  ""I wanted to be surrounded by art and music and I wanted to live near the water,"" said Proctor, who opened The Gallery Art Bistro earlier this year.  The name of her new business is tattooed on her forearm. ""The purpose of the gallery was to support arts, visual arts and musicians,"" said the mother of two adult sons.  ""I needed a buy-in from the community and the artists."" And she got it, with only a bit of pushback from a couple of local residents who were unsure what this outsider was bringing to their quiet village, she says. Once she had all the municipal permissions in place and contractors hired, Proctor rolled up her sleeves and set her hands and imagination to work. She would need both. For 14 years the 1924 building had been a discount store, its faded walls crammed to the ceiling with stuff.  Redeveloping would be a huge project but for the artist who usually works in acrylic on canvas, she saw the space as a giant art project, a challenge. ""I saw beyond the clutter,"" she said. During the renovation she found one lovely surprise that would form a foundation for the look of the place: An interior brick wall covered in sea foam green paint. She scraped off just enough to give the wall a distressed but modern feel. Perfect, thought the 50-year-old, who used the green throughout the bistro, set against the white freshness of Ikea furniture.  She also included a basket of various percussion instruments, such as shakers, for customers to play along with musicians at weekly open-mike nights. It's not really surprising that the artist proved so entrepreneurial. Proctor grew up in Cambridge. Her father, Larry Olney, owned eight A&W restaurants and though she worked in the family business for a while, it really wasn't what she wanted to do. For a decade, Proctor worked as a paramedic in Mississauga.  In 2003, she suffered a serious spinal injury and was relegated to desk duties, though even that proved too painful. So she quit.  Following surgery in the United States, Proctor returned to school, first studying business at Wilfrid Laurier University then marketing at Conestoga College, where she won a provincial award in 2009 and worked in marketing for five years.  Proctor said this background in business and marketing gave her the edge she needed to launch the gallery. In terms of art, she had studied in college for a year before joining her father's business. While recovering from surgery, she returned to the canvas full time. By 2016, Proctor was starting to take her work into the public, an experience she described as ""terrifying putting yourself out there.""  But her art with its whimsical animal, nature and musical themes — plus use of brilliant colours — caught the eye of buyers. ""People starting telling me 'You're good,' "" she said. ""I've always had art in my life."" She is already making plans to expand the bistro, including hiring a chef to create a menu, and she has collaborated with several artists and businesses from Cambridge, such as Monigram Coffee Roasters, a company that helped set up her café and train the baristas.  Plus, she carries works from Hilborn Pottery Design and treats from Reid Candy and Nut Shop, both from Cambridge, and she has hosted several local and Guelph musicians.  ""Most of the other art is mine except three artists local to the Port Rowan area,"" said Proctor, who divides her time between her house in Cambridge and an apartment across the street from the bistro. vhill@therecord.com Twitter: @HillRecord"

It may seem there’s a huge chasm between them, but the space is much less than we think. As we begin to come together again with family and friends — with our community — we talk about the life we lived before the pandemic and look to the life we might live after. Between Before and After lies what is possible. It’s a space to think, to reflect, to dream, to innovate. It is the space, perhaps, where there is a stillness, like that needed for prayer. These are lessons captured by Inuit artist Elisapee Ishulutaq and her painting “Tusiarvik (A Place for Prayer)” — in which an understanding of what went before leads to innovation and creation. “As an artist who participated in the founding of the print studio in Pangnirtung (in Nunavut), Ishulutaq is recognized as a pioneer of artmaking in her community and thus given the respect due an elder,” Christine Lalonde wrote of Ishulutaq, who died in 2018, in the catalogue “Builders.” “Despite being the elder in the group, Ishulutaq emerged as the most capable and ready to experiment … New directions are not only taken up by emerging artists, they are pursued actively by elder artists whose technical experience allows them to adapt processes to new media with confidence and perhaps innovate further than their younger contemporaries,” wrote Lalonde, associate curator of Indigenous art at the National Gallery of Canada. In “Vision, Space, Desire: Global Perspectives and Cultural Hybridity,” Indigenous artist and curator Jolene Rickard, quoted by Lalonde, notes that Indigenous artists “have densely packed cultural survival kits that transfer knowledge from one generation to the next, despite unremitting attempts at genocide, culturacide, and other forms of political and philosophical erasure. Native communities or nations have something the world needs to know about: the insight of continuity.” Instead of forgetting the past, we must learn from it. Let us share our stories, our experiences; let the time we’ve spent become part of our collective knowledge. Then we can weave the past and present in a future that has learned its lessons."

These Toronto curators can help you find it,['Sue CarterSpecial to the Star'],"Fri., July 10, 2020","On Canada Day, a group of 16 artists gathered in Kensington Market to produce a colourful street mural, each painting a letter of “Black Lives Matter” on Augusta Street in their own unique style. For some passersby, this may have been their first encounter with work by local Black artists. While more people are examining the books on their shelves and the TV shows they stream for anti-Black racism, visual arts consumption is often ignored. For those who want to start buying Black art but don’t know where to start, we asked four curators for their advice. Check out alternative spaces and you might find the next star. If it hadn’t been for COVID-19, this would have been the third year that freelance photographer and videographer Tiana Smith curated a Pride month show at 187 Augusta dedicated to artists who “push the boundaries of society by existing and creating their art as 2SQTBIPOC.”  Smith, a stylist who always has a camera in tow, credits the show with opening up opportunities for her own portrait photography at larger venues like the ROM.  “When I look around, other than Church Street, I haven’t really seen a lot of queer Black people being able to take up space and sharing their work in a way that isn’t tokenizing them or making them feel small,” says Smith. “I’m really proud of the way my work showcases women of colour and other people who aren’t of the norm. When I’m able to showcase queer folks and what they actually look like, I’m advocating for more representation for queer people.” Keosha Love’s spoken word practice, poetry and art curation intersects with her work as an activist and as the founder of Our Women’s Voices, which aims to create safe spaces for marginalized women through community. The recent Ryerson University grad has already appeared in several major brand campaigns by the likes of Nike and Absolut, who have recognized Love’s multi-faceted work. Love recommends that, before taking a trip to a major gallery, people spend time online seeking out artists through their websites and Instagram.  “Most don’t have the liberty of getting a gallery showcase; those things are privileges that not all BIPOC artists have,” says Love, using the acronym for Black, Indigenous and people of colour. “Try searching up some local BIPOC artists and go to their websites. It’s the best way to support them.” Love’s advice is backed by numbers. Recently, Palestinian-Canadian artist Ibrahim Abusitta published a spreadsheet on Instagram in which he tallied the number of artists who are Black, Indigenous or persons of colour represented by Toronto commercial galleries. Of the 18 galleries surveyed, only 11 of the 454 artists Abusitta counted are Black. Some of those artists are dead. This abysmal number was not a surprise to John Samuels (a.k.a. rapper Just John), artistic director of the arts coalition Blank Canvas, which won a $20,000 Toronto Arts Foundation Award last year for its work with marginalized youth. While much of the public discussion right now is centred around anti-Black racism in specific cultural institutions and the systems that have kept artists’ work out of galleries and collectors’ hands, Samuels believes it’s time to think bigger. He sees an opportunity to completely reinvent the art world, top to bottom, including how art is purchased. “People who want to buy Black artists’ work also need to reimagine how they’re supporting artists and how they’re supporting Black communities,” he says.  Samuels suggests investigating grassroots arts organizations like Blank Canvas, the Black Legal Action Centre or the Nia Centre for the Arts, which just announced plans to build Canada’s first multidisciplinary centre for African-Canadian art. “I think it’s really about having willingness to learn and educate yourself because if you don’t know who the artist is, or where this artwork is coming from or the rootedness of it, it’s out of sight, out of mind,” Samuels says. Artist and curator James Hewitt understands that, for many people, walking into a commercial gallery and asking about artworks can be an intimidating experience. The OCAD University grad cut his teeth at various spaces, including stints assisting Paul Petro and beloved late Parkdale gallerist Katharine Mulherin, immersing himself in all aspects of the business. Hewitt is now preparing to open his own gallery, The Run, this month in the Runnymede and Annette neighbourhood.  Together with his business partner, photographer Michael Jewer, Hewitt envisions a space that makes people feel at ease. He selected his initial stable of Black and Indigenous artists — many of whom he’s exhibited with in the past — for their “dynamic perspectives and ideas.”  Hewitt, whose own expressive figurative charcoal drawings will also be exhibited at the gallery, recommends that new collectors start small with original works. “Build patronage with the artists that you admire. If you can, try to build a friendship or relationship,” says Hewitt. “Try to have real conversations with them so that it takes some mythology away from the artist and it makes them less intimidating. You can learn a lot about their work just through talking.” Here are five artists to start your search: Jacquie Comrie Dubbed the queen of colour, Comrie’s vivid geometric murals and canvases make you feel good, thanks to her grounding research on the healing power of colour on mental well-being.

If we can’t be with people, do we forget how to connect? No. Instead, we find new ways of sharing and understanding each other.  The students at Etobicoke School of the Arts, like other pupils honing their creativity across the city, the country and the world, usually have a year-end exhibition. They show and sell their work, hold a Portfolio Day to showcase the fruits of their labour and create connections with the larger, outside world.  This year, the Class of 2020 has taken the sale online.  “The tension with teaching and having the sale online is the loss of personal interaction with other people,” observes Matthew Varey, head of contemporary art at the Toronto high school. “We are used to engaging with brilliant, creative, humble, powerful and ambitious people every day. That is the loss I am feeling, and the one I hear from the students that is being felt most deeply.” For Ella Webber, the just-graduated Grade 12 student and young artist who painted this portrait of “Charlotte,” her art is a way of connecting with her peers, with the people she encounters in the world each day. She creates large-scale portraits — the size of the art, she says, “increases the intimate connection that I share with it, strengthening my personal bond with my subjects and allowing my paintings to take on a life of their own.  “Through portraits I’m working to understand the complexities, nuances and possibilities of human connection.”  In exhibition, her portraits command our attention. The people in them demand we see their perspective and understand their stories.  These students are graduating to a wider world. By supporting them in their creativity and understanding the way they see the world, together we can all graduate to a better one.  To see the exhibition, learn more about these young artists or to buy a painting, go to the online sale at www.esava.ca. Half of the sale price goes to the students and half to the school — to inspire and support more students to create, and in so doing to encourage all of us to see the world through fresh eyes. "

He collaborated with University of Guelph professor, Kim Anderson, on ""Injichaag,"" a collection of his poetry, paintings and autobiography, released last December. The two of them shared the stage Dec. 3 in a series on Indigeneity for Third Age Learning in Waterloo. He played a native flute, read a few of his poems and told stories from his life. That he was well-received is an understatement: more than 60 copies of his book were sold that day! I contacted him after the Waterloo event and we met in the art-filled living room of his Guelph home on Jan. 22, which turned out to be his 73rd birthday. There are many books now exploring the cultural genocide dealt by the Residential Schools in Canada. ""Injichaag"" is one in which the nuns in Meshake's Longlac Indian Day School failed ""to take the Indian out of the child,"" as Sir John A. Macdonald had demanded in establishing the mission of the residential schools and the Indian Act.  Meshake was blessed by having lived on the land with his grandmother (Nookomis) for his first 10 years, before entering the infamous school. And then by having a Mother Superior who was more interested in helping him discover his talents (via penmanship and art) than in eradicating his background. But he was sexually abused by a Catholic lay brother and could not rise above the shame to report his abuser. Nevertheless his twin matriarchs — grandmother and nun — were key to his survival, and a spirituality today that blends native and Catholic elements. The facts of Meshake's life are recorded in Anderson's introduction, a more linear version of the anecdotes and word reclamations that make up the rest of the book. He was born in 1948 in Nakina. His mother took him home the next day to Aroland, part of the Longlac reserve settlement near Geraldton in northern Ontario. His grandmother provided his ""bush education"" in between periods at the native schools in Aroland and Longlac. From 1955-66 he was sent to the McIntosh residential school in northwestern Ontario. This period was the peak of residential school enrolment: in all, 150,000 children were interned between the late 1800s and 1996.  Very little of his school life there is included in ""Injichaag."" Anderson explains that Meshake's feelings of shame and inferiority were consistent with the body of literature about residential school life. His poor self-esteem was worsened by the deaths of his mother in 1960 and grandmother the following year. He did manage to finish high school in Thunder Bay and, at age 18 in 1966, enrolled in graphic design at Sheridan College in Toronto. What followed graduation were years of wandering, including work as a firefighter and tree planter with his father in Geraldton, and as a graphic designer. But he was medicating his rage and depression with alcohol. He married in 1978 but left his wife and stepchildren in '83, ending up on the streets in Winnipeg for three years and then six years of homelessness and alcoholism in Toronto. The turning point, as he tells it in the story ""Eshpinadaa,"" came in 1991. He waited for a store in Chinatown to open so he could buy a jug of Chines cooking wine to share with his buddies. He looked up at the street sign for Spadina Avenue and realized it was an Anishinaabe word Shba'-dinnaa, meaning rising hills or mountaintop. ""I cried out to the Creator, Give me life or death, no matter how! Do whatever it takes! I don't give a s---!"" It was at the burial of his best friend, who had died in an alcoholic coma, where Meshake buried his past. From there he found an Anishinaabe health clinic and a social worker named Alex who mentored him into sobriety via three native healing lodges. ""So that word Eshpadinaa has been very significant on my journey. Because you worship the Creator on a high hill, on a high place. And I've been climbing the hill ever since."" He also had a dream around that time in which his ancestors told him not to be afraid of his words. This book ends with a five-page glossary, a reminder of all the Anishinaabek words he teaches the reader and reclaims for himself. It was during his recovery that Rene met Joan, a social worker, who would become his second wife. He credits her with helping him maintain his ""fast"" from alcohol and build a home together in Guelph. The recent Truth and Reconciliation payment to residential school survivors went to paying off his mortgage and investing in computers, art supplies and musical instruments. Currently he is collaborating via the internet with a native composer in British Columbia. He hopes to put some of his Anishinaabek words and poems to music for a cabaret-style performance.  After our interview he was flying with Joan and Anderson to Winnipeg to launch his book at the International Writers Festival. ""Seven generations from now, I hope my people will read this book written by their ancestor. This is my legacy, something that will outlive me.""  ""Injichaag"" is a soul journey that reverberates with me, part of the path of decolonization and reconciliation. Happy Birthday, Rene!

I can even count half a dozen Camino pilgrims among my friends. But I had not heard of Via Francigena, the pilgrimage which runs from Canterbury to Rome, until reading Timothy Egan's book, released in October. Egan is a Pulitzer-winning reporter and columnist for the New York Times and author of eight other books. He grew up in an Irish-American Catholic family but his relationship with the church is, well, complicated. It is clouded by the recent death of his devout mother, and the pending death from cancer of his sister-in-law. Also his brother left the church when his best friend committed suicide after the sexual abuse by a priest was made public. The Via Francigena thousand-mile route was first traced by Sigiric, the Archbishop of Canterbury in 880 AD. It begins at Canterbury Cathedral in England, crosses to France and runs roughly parallel to the border with Belgium and Germany. The trail rises into the Swiss Alps before descending into Italy's Tuscany and Siena regions, ending at St Peter's in Rome. As Egan discovers, one reason it is less popular (1,200 travellers in 2012) than the Santiago is the lack of dedicated accommodations and infrastructure. Egan is doing the trek for more than personal reasons. He wants to visit the churches, abbeys and religious sites that marked the spread of Christianity in the medieval centuries. Where is religion, the dominant force in earlier eras, in modern European culture? He hopes for a chance to interview Pope Francis when he gets to Rome, to gauge his impact on a church in crisis. His first steps in Canterbury are underwhelming. A bone fragment and a piece of vestments from Thomas � Becket are behind glass in the Martyr's Chapel of Saint Thomas Catholic Church. He feels unmoved and bemused when he can't buy a copy of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in the gift shop, told that it's too bawdy to sell in a church. But outside he spots the first Via Francigena trail-marker, a pilgrim in a monk's robe with a walking stick. And he meets two young women also beginning the pilgrimage. The reader tags along, intrigued by the history of each town, city or countryside he passes through. Egan had not trained for the physical challenges of hiking a thousand miles on foot. He is also no purist, opting for rail or bus transport when the weather turns hot or the trail follows the edge of a busy highway. Foot problems plague the final stages of his route. His son, his daughter and later his wife each join him for segments but most of the time he is alone, though not without a cellphone. I was intrigued by the chapter on St. Maurice/St. Moritz in Switzerland. My dad never liked his middle name, Maurice, after Maurice Chevalier, the French actor and a heartthrob of my grandmother. He pronounced it ""Morris"" not ""Moreese"" but he might've felt differently if he'd known about the saint from the third century who was beheaded by the Roman emperor Maximian. It wasn't until 1250 that Maurice's statue, clearly showing his Black African race, was erected in Madeburg, Germany. He is the guiding saint of the Swiss Guard, protectors of the pope, and almost 600 houses of worship around the world bear his name. Why do people go on pilgrimages in this secular age? Egan asks this of a Tuscan priest in the Abbey of San Capresio, one of the oldest monasteries on the route. He finds that pilgrims (women outnumber men) want to talk about their marriages, their jobs, their families. ""My sense is that people who do the whole Via end up with a major change in how they live."" Egan asks if they become more spiritual. ""Not necessarily. They learn how to think more clearly."" The priest goes on to explain his theory that modern-day Italians have lost the daily habit of a siesta, running in ever faster circles of work and money.  This reminds me of my first trip to Tuscany in 2003 and my take-away from living in that gorgeous countryside: ""la dolce far niente,"" or ""the sweetness of doing nothing."" At the dawn of the 2020s we could all find ways to think more clearly, and to rediscover the pleasures of idleness, he said just after taking a siesta. ""A Pilgrimage to Eternity"" provides some encouraging light on the trail forward. Chuck Erion is the former co-owner of Words Worth Books, Waterloo "

With that in mind, Sophie Mackintosh follows up her debut “The Water Cure” (which was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2018) with a new take on patriarchal dystopia. When a girl in this new state begins menstruating, she is selected by random lottery to either become a wife and mother (receiving a white ticket) or be fitted with an IUD so she can enter into a career (the blue ticket of the title). Calla gets a blue ticket but finds the resulting freedom (“My time belonged to me, my life was only mine.”) to be an ambiguous blessing. After getting pregnant she has to make a run for the border, as it’s open season on wayward women like her. The feminist message is presented in stark terms. Men are nameless, senseless brutes while, among women, there is at least the possibility of fellow-feeling. Calla’s pregnancy both turns her inward and makes her more in tune with nature: transforming her into “a warm-blooded female animal” who speaks to rocks and dirt. What is more interesting, however, is Calla’s evolving understanding of the operation of individual free will in conflict with society, and the relation between agency and responsibility. Burn-In By P. W. Singer and August Cole Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 417 pages, $39.98  A surprise comes right on the second page of “Burn-In.” It takes the form of an endnote. The presence of endnotes signals what the authors have dubbed “useful fiction” meant to “aid broader engagement with the thorny issues related to technology and society that will soon become all too real.” Or which are real already, since all the technology is drawn from current research. Hence the endnotes. The delivery vehicle for this cutting-edge messaging is an action thriller that follows the typical buddy-cop formula. FBI agent Lara Keegan is uncomfortably paired up with a new police robot named TAMS (Tactical Autonomous Mobility System) that represents the latest “meld of evolution and engineering.” Together, this odd couple must foil a gang of technoterrorists. All SF engages to some degree with issues relating to technology and society, so the “useful fiction” label isn’t very helpful. But it does give you some idea of how the authors target hot-button political issues of the day, and “Burn-In” will definitely appeal to those who want to stay one page ahead of the headlines. Network Effect By Martha Wells Tor, 352 pages, $36.50  Over the last few years the character of Murderbot has become an SF sensation. Murderbot is a security cyborg with a difference, a killing machine who loves binge-watching television dramas in his down time while making wry observations about his human charges. His adventures have been documented thus far in a series of four novellas known as “The Murderbot Diaries.” “Network Effect” is the first novel. Though it’s a standalone work, you’d be advised to read the Diaries first. Many of the characters are recurring, including a transport ship named ART who has as much attitude as Murderbot and plays a central role in the story. Though there’s lots of action, what makes Murderbot so engaging is his voice. Murderbot is never as interested in what’s going on around him as he is in talking to himself, and even when blowing things up or shooting bad guys he remains withdrawn. A heavy use of parentheses has the effect of reinforcing his obsessive interiority. He likes his extended human family well enough but they’re hard to relate to. It may be that ART is the only one capable of drawing him out of his armoured shell. The Oppenheimer Alternative By Robert J. Sawyer Red Deer Press, 392 pages, $24.95  In “The Oppenheimer Alternative,” award-winning SF writer Robert J. Sawyer heads in a slightly different direction. As the story begins, we’re in the world of thoroughly researched historical fiction, with the scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer (“Oppie”) heading to work on the Manhattan Project, the code name for America’s effort to create an atomic bomb. From here, however, things soon spin into alternate- or secret-history territory as it’s discovered that the solar system is about to experience a catastrophic meltdown, forcing the assembled all-stars of theoretical physics to become not the destroyers but the saviours of the world. You can always count on Sawyer, a storyteller of the first order, for a good read. “The Oppenheimer Alternative” delivers on that count, but it’s also a book that explores, on a human level, the sort of bigger questions raised by such world-changing events, both real and imagined."

Messy, gassy, and unapologetically, I take up space, much like a full-grown Saint Bernard, in my parents’ parallel universe. Sadly, the pandemic has reduced this broke-ass millennial into a drooling state of oversized adolescence. After living in a luxury granite box with six roommates (two of them were front-line workers), and surviving a turtle-slow recovery from COVID-19 symptoms, I found myself moving residences again in May 2020.  At 11 a.m., ravenous, I amble into my parents’ basement for breakfast. I count seven family-sized bags of yam tortilla chips, thirty-two cans of cream of mushroom soup, two forty-pound bags of jasmine rice, and seven bottles of blue dishwashing liquid. Name it, and we most likely have it, buried under the bulk bird seed on Shelf 8. “Told you to always stock up for emergencies,” my mother announces. I roll my eyes, but I help her set a trap for our ongoing rodent problem. Diaspora, like heart-exploding grief, OCD, and excessive ambition, has both wrecked and strengthened our family. My Chinese family belongs to a particular sect of professional hoarders, and this current pandemic has only validated their lifestyle. Like many once impoverished immigrants, we have been preparing — AKA paranoid — for multiple global disasters long before COVID-19 happened. I once used to scoff at this gratuitous habit of radical saving and stockpiling on repeat, but it makes sense to me now.  For as long as I can remember, my parents have resisted the preternatural tug of the homeland. It wasn’t until March 2019 that the siren call, like severe tinnitus, became impossible to ignore. Off to Hong Kong we embarked, a place of once vicious famine and long-squashed dreams. It would be my first time in Asia, and I couldn’t bear to turn down a complimentary trip. Upon leaving Hong Kong International Airport, as if by sorcery, the humidity freshened my sandpaper skin, and volumized my iron-flat Vancouverite hair. It was as if the city was welcoming it’s long lost, weirdo daughter with a makeover. Our week was a flurry of show and tell and, one day, we went to my parents’ respective villages. We took the MTR from Mong Kok, bussed on public transit, rode a train, which was followed by multiple taxi rides to the slums. It took 4.5 hours to get there. Finally, my mother, almost shyly, showed us her childhood home-school, built on top of a creepy open-hole graveyard, and talked about how she would play with the jutting bones of corpses as a child. The grotesque trees, arthritic-looking and uncared for, made me so sad I felt everything turn to decay inside me. “No wonder you’re so messed up,” I blurted, and instantly regretted it. “You’re the one who’s messed up,” she retorted in Cantonese. “Can’t do math, complains all the time about stomach aches-” “No,” I said, shivering despite the heat. “I mean, this is why you are so scared of ghosts and starving to death.” “Um, yeah,” she said, smacking me on the back of my head. I groaned. But then she sighed, eyebrows furrowing together. She glanced around, no longer a simple tourist, as if really looking for the first time, seemingly sorrowful at the dilapidated graves scattered around us. Did she regret coming back? However she felt, for the first time I understood her fear of scarcity, this ancient inherited trauma. After all, I felt diaspora was best suited for gamblers, entrepreneurs, great white sharks, and hopeless optimists. For the rest of us, mediocres and sentimentalists, when you involuntarily hop country and home, you accumulate a Tantalus gluttony, and you fill the physical void with pragmatic things that can be eaten, bartered or saved. POC, especially impoverished ones like my mother, understand that shit inevitably happens, and it’s best to be prepared. Nice housing is only provisional. “We’re never coming back,” my mother finally pronounced, and we followed her, like a congregation of fruit flies — far away from her private destitution to our four-star hotel, our temporary home in Asia. As for me, I didn’t mind Hong Kong at all. In fact, it felt like I had almost never left Vancouver. Everyone looked exactly like me, neither worse nor better. For the remaining trip, we ate and shopped like the middle-class we aspired to be, as if we were badass rice-eaters on vacation instead of scared immigrants on their homecoming. I arrived back in Canada with fifteen cheap polyester dresses, all beaded, lacy and ridiculous, and I decided I was ready for any literary event, Comic-Con or Halloween. It only fazed me a little that being a size 2 in North America meant that I was XXXL in Asia. In my eccentric, complicated glory, I realized that I’d become capitalism’s bitch and my mother’s daughter: more is better and surplus is safer.  In my parents’ world, though, it often feels like I’m tumbling backwards when my peers are levelling up with adulting in the guise of matrimony, mortgages, babies, promotions. I tell myself when the pandemic is over, surely I’ll move into the RV parked on the driveway or perhaps a distant relation (that I don’t know of) will die, leaving me money and allowing me to purchase a sea vessel. Wouldn’t it be super-fun to live on a houseboat? I think excitedly. You could throw your roommates, friends, lovers, and family members overboard whenever they were too loud or obnoxious. COVID-19 may be my generation’s diaspora, but it’s also my family’s latest, haunting trauma. At my parents’ dwelling, I have a recurring high-stress nightmare where I am trying to frantic-pack a wheelie suitcase because the building is supposed to explode in two minutes. Panicked, I hurl clothing into a never ending black hole of fabric. Fed up, I zip up the case, but it expands like an inflatable balloon. Screeching, I beseech the suitcase to rescale to a normal size. Action-heroine I am not, and the suitcase knows this. Eventually, it grows so unwieldy and wide that it doesn’t fit through the door frame, but I’m relentless and determined enough to save all my belongings, even though I know I’m doomed. Then, as the building ignites, special effects inferno-BOOM!, homegirl wakes up-all lock-jawed, sweat-stinky, and terrified. It is a shame to lose all my things! I growl, and regretful I am in this waking life, and so I wonder where I had purchased the defective suitcase. Who do I blame, really, but myself? Anything, at any moment in flight, might turn out to be unbearable, might transform into a sign of absurdity that one might never escape."

The stories of excess that make for great anecdotes in rock memoirs, he found, were “Kryptonite for a reader’s connection with characters.”  And if, as the saying goes, describing music is like dancing about architecture, then “writing about nonexistent songs,” the English novelist says, “is a double dance.” But Mitchell is not one to back down from a challenge and “Utopia Avenue” is a 550-page-long triple album in literary form. Each chapter shares its title with a song from one of the band’s three releases and each is told through the songwriter’s own perspective. Mitchell’s writing has always been a bit prog-rock, especially the unorthodox structures he invents. His 2004 novel “Cloud Atlas” (adapted for film in 2012 by the Wachowskis) nests six different narratives from six different genres within one another; and his last book, “Slade House” (2015), includes five related horror stories, each set nine years later than the last.  What’s more, stories and characters overlap between his books. In “Utopia Avenue,” Luisa Rey, heroine of the “airport thriller” section of “Cloud Atlas,” reappears as a band member’s girlfriend. Guitarist Jasper de Zoet turns out to be descended from the titular 18th-century Dutch trader in “The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet” (2010) — and, like his ancestor, his own story slides into dark fantasy, a twist on the rock ’n’ roll trope of selling your soul to the devil. Of course, Mitchell would not grace international bestseller lists as often as he does if he were simply an ambitious virtuoso. “Utopia Avenue” is big-hearted and emotionally rich. And while the band’s three songwriters — Jasper, bassist Dean Moss and keyboardist Elf (or Elizabeth Frances) Holloway — aren’t averse to sex, drugs or rock ’n’ roll tomfoolery, they also grapple with personal issues. Dean is trying to come to terms with the abuse he endured in childhood, Jasper with the voices he hears in his head, Elf with her sexuality. Their struggles resonate with tectonic cultural shifts. The novel is set in 1967-68 when, in both the U.K. and the U.S., previously marginalized views about civil liberties and human rights had evolved into a robust counterculture. “Idealism was vital and organized enough to gain mass self-expression,” says Mitchell, on a web chat from his home in West Cork, Ireland, “and it wasn’t old enough for cynicism and jadedness to have wilted its appeal.”  Hence the optimism underlying his fictional band’s name. And yet, when Mitchell was writing the book, “Trump got elected, Brexit happened and I would often berate myself: ‘This is all 50 years ago. You should be writing about now.’ Of course, reality has the last laugh: suddenly it doesn’t feel so distant. Sometimes the pendulum swings back and people do believe. Ideas demonstrably can and do change, if not the world in its totality, certainly aspects of it. ‘The statue was there; the statue’s not there. Here’s the idea; here’s the change.’” So, to ask Mitchell a question posed to his fictional band in a press conference, can songs — or any kind of art — change the world?  “Art is like the heat on a stove. If the hob on your cooker goes from 0 up to 9 — or 0 to 11 in honour of ‘Spinal Tap’ — it’s rare that art makes things boil, but certainly art has a sort of 1-to-4 setting that’s pretty constant on consumers of that art. “The nature of the transformation might not be obvious. When I was a kid, listening to Rush’s ‘Moving Pictures,’ why that album, again and again and again? I couldn’t articulate it then and it’s hard to articulate now but, at some level, it was interacting with my imagination and maybe having a formative effect on it.” In “Utopia Avenue,” Jasper calls songs “seeds” that sometimes take root in fertile minds, and suggests “life could be, should be, better than this. An invitation to slip into somebody else’s skin for a little while.” One chapter is structured around the reactions of a fan whom Elf can see as she’s singing an autobiographical song in concert, which builds a kind of kinship between them, across a crowded club. They glimpse something of themselves in one another. The same happens when Mitchell’s characters meet real-life rockers in the book. Elf has a heart-to-heart with Janis Joplin about being a woman in a phallocentric business, and Jasper and the Rolling Stones’ doomed Brian Jones discuss feeling haunted.  “Utopia Avenue” is strewn with cameos from musicians who have since passed on to that great gig in the sky — from Syd Barrett to David Bowie to Sandy Denny to Jimi Hendrix to Frank Zappa — and they’re there not only as Easter eggs for music geeks, but as advancers of the plot, Greek choristers or dispensers of (sometimes crazy) wisdom. Mitchell has fun with them too: he introduces Leonard Cohen as a man in the elevator of the Chelsea Hotel whose aftershave “smells of tea and oranges” (a nod to the Cohen composition “Suzanne”). “Novels are alive with background details that ring true, or smell or feel true,” says Mitchell, “and that has to come from somewhere, so why not from a song?” In some of the novel’s most vivid, immersive passages, real-life figures serve as guides — for readers and characters alike — to a different reality.  The band’s manager, transplanted Torontonian Levon Frankland, meets artist Francis Bacon and follows him on a phantasmagoric journey through a demimonde of transgressive London clubs — and then explains to him his own calling as an enabler of others’ art. In another, Dean drops acid with the Grateful Dead’s Jerry Garcia, who leads him through a warped San Francisco, complete with a talking burger bun, to an unexpected personal reckoning with his past. And Cohen invites Elf to a rooftop party where, despite feeling embarrassed about her own work, she sings a new song that seems to conjure up her loved one out of thin air. “Like most of us,” says Mitchell, “I’ve got a particular relationship with music. It’s a mood-enhancer; it’s a calmer-downer; occasionally it’s a transcendental drug. Music is many things, but pretty much all of them life-enhancing.” And this can be true, as “Utopia Avenue proves,” even when it doesn’t exist."

Organizers said Tuesday that they are pushing forward with plans for its 77th instalment, which will include a slightly reduced number of films in the main competition as well as some outdoor and virtual screenings. If the schedule stays intact, it will be the first major film festival since COVID-19 essentially shut down the industry in mid-March. Festival director Alberto Barbera said in a statement that he is “extremely pleased that the Biennale Cinema can be held with a minimum reduction of films and sections” and that “a significant number of directors and actors will accompany films to the Lido.” There will still be 50 to 55 films in the official selection, which will be announced on July 28, and screenings will take place in the traditional venues as well as two outdoor arenas (at the Giardini della Biennale and a skating rink on the Lido) with adopted safety measures established by authorities. The festival will take its Virtual Reality section online and this year forego its Sconfini section, which hosts smaller films and genre fare, to accommodate more socially distanced screenings of the major films in competition. Actress Cate Blanchett is presiding over the main competition jury. Travel to Italy, an early epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, is allowed from European countries. The European Union last week said it would reopen its border to 14 nations, but most Americans have been refused entry due to soaring coronavirus infections in the U.S. Press from countries with travel restrictions will be able to view press conferences virtually, Barbera said. “Without forgetting the countless victims of these past few months to whom due tribute shall be paid, the first international festival following the forced interruption dictated by the pandemic becomes the meaningful celebration of the re—opening we all looked forward to, and a message of concrete optimism for the entire world of cinema which has suffered greatly from this crisis,” Barbera said. The Toronto International Film Festival, which is typically held on the heels of Venice in September, has already announced plans for a smaller 2020 version, with fewer films and virtual red carpets. Both festivals serve as major launching grounds for awards hopefuls, although no one know how exactly it will work now that runway to the Oscars has been extended by two months. The Venice Film Festival runs from Sept. 2-12."
125,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/entertainment/movies/2020/07/spaghetti-western-movie-composer-ennio-morricone-dead-at-91.html,Spaghetti Western movie composer Ennio Morricone dead at 91,"[""Frances D'EmilioThe Associated Press""]","Mon., July 6, 2020","ROME - Ennio Morricone, the Oscar-winning Italian composer who created the coyote-howl theme for the iconic Spaghetti Western “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” and often haunting soundtracks for such classic Hollywood gangster movies as “The Untouchables” and the epic “Once Upon A Time In America,” died Monday. He was 91. Morricone’s longtime lawyer, Giorgio Assumma, said “the Maestro,” as he was known, died in a Rome hospital of complications following surgery after a recent fall in which he broke a leg bone. Outside the hospital, Assumma read a farewell message from Morricone. “I am Ennio Morricone, and I am dead,” began the message. In the greeting, the composer went on to explain that the only reason he was saying goodbye this way and had requested a private funeral was: “I don’t want to bother anyone.” During a career that spanned decades and earned him an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Morricone collaborated with some of Hollywood’s and Italy’s top directors, including on “The Untouchables” by Brian de Palma, “The Hateful Eight” by Quentin Tarantino , “The Battle of Algiers” by Gillo Pontecorvo and “Nuovo Cinema Paradiso,” a nostalgic ode to the importance of movie houses in Italian small town life, by Giuseppe Tornatore. The Tarantino film would win him the Oscar for best original score in 2016. In accepting that award, Morricone told the audience at the ceremony: “There is no great music without a great film that inspires it.” In total, he produced more than 400 original scores for feature films. His iconic so-called Spaghetti Western movies saw him work closely with the late Italian film director Sergio Leone, a former classmate. Morricone practically reinvented music for Western genre movies through his partnership with Leone. Their partnership included the “Dollars” trilogy starring Clint Eastwood as a quick-shooting, lonesome gunman: “A Fistful of Dollars” in 1964, “For a Few Dollars More” in 1965 and “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” a year later. Morricone was celebrated for crafting just a few notes — like the four notes played on a miniature pan flute favoured by a character in Leone’s 1984 movie “Once Upon A Time in America” — that would instantly become a film’s highly memorable motif. That movie is a saga about Jewish gangsters in New York that explores themes of friendship, lost love and the passing of time, starring Robert De Niro and James Woods. It is considered by some to be Leone’s masterpiece, thanks in part to Morricone’s evocative score, including a lush section played on string instruments. “Inspiration does not exist,” Morricone said in a 2004 interview with The Associated Press. “What exists is an idea, a minimal idea that the composer develops at the desk, and that small idea becomes something important.” In a later interview, with Italian state TV, Morricone cited “study, discipline and curiosity” as the keys to his creative genius. “Writing music, like all creative arts, comes from a long path” along life’s experiences, he said. “A great phenomenon of world music” was how Italian film director Dario Argento described Morricone, who scored five of his films. In his late 80s, Morricone provided the score for “The Hateful Eight,” Tarantino’s 2015 70-mm epic and the first time in decades that he had composed new music for a Western. It was also the first time Tarantino had used an original score. In accepting Morricone’s Golden Globe for the music in his place, Tarantino called him his favourite composer. “When I say ‘favourite composer,’ I don’t mean movie composer. ... I’m talking about Mozart, I’m talking about Beethoven, I’m talking about Schubert,” Tarantino said. Italy’s head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, in a condolence message to the composer’s family, wrote: “Both a refined and popular musician, he left a deep footprint on the musical history of the second half of the 1900s.” Morricone’s sound tracks, Mattarella said, “contributed greatly to spreading and reinforcing the prestige of Italy in the world.” Morricone’s style was sparse, made of memorable tunes and unusual instruments and arrangements, and often stirred deep emotions. His music punctuated the long silences typical of the Spaghetti Westerns, with the characters locked in close-ups, staring at each other and waiting for their next moves. The coyote howl, harmonicas and eerie whistling of “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” became Morricone’s trademark and one of the most easily recognizable soundtracks in cinema. Minutes before handing Morricone the Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Eastwood recalled hearing for the first time the score of “A Fistful of Dollars” and thinking: “What actor wouldn’t want to ride into town with that kind of music playing behind him?” It was a night to remember for Morricone, who had been nominated for Oscars five times (“The Hateful Eight” was his sixth) but until then had never won. Born in Rome on Nov. 10, 1928, Morricone was the oldest of the five children. His father was a trumpet player. After studying trumpet and composition at the Conservatory of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in the Italian capital, he started working as a trumpeter and then as an arranger for record companies. “I started working on very easy kinds of music pieces for the radio, for television and then for the theatre, and then little by little I started to compose the film scores,” he told the AP in 2016. In 1961 he wrote his first score for a movie, a bittersweet comedy set in the final moments of Fascism called “Il Federale” (known in English as “The Fascist”). That decade also saw Morricone co-operate with Pontecorvo, first on “The Battle of Algiers,” the black-and-white classic depicting the Algerian uprising against the French; and later on “Queimada,” a tale of colonialism starring Marlon Brando. Morricone received his first Oscar nomination for original score with “Days Of Heaven,” a 1978 movie by U.S. director Terence Malick. Beside “The Hateful Eight,” the others were for “The Mission” (1986), “The Untouchables” (1987), “Bugsy” (1991) and “Malena” (2000). Shortly before his lifetime Oscar, Morricone joked that he would have been happy without the coveted statuette, saying “I would have remained in the company of illustrious non-winners.” But he also made no secret that he thought “The Mission,” with its memorably sweet theme of “Gabriel’s Oboe,” deserved the Academy Award. That year, he lost to Herbie Hancock’s “Round Midnight.” Morricone had recently composed music to be performed in Genoa’s Carlo Felice Theater later this summer in honour of the 43 victims of that city’s 2018 Morandi Bridge collapse, Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci said. The music will be performed on the eve of a ceremony inaugurating the bridge’s replacement, the mayor said. Highly versatile, Morricone also orchestrated Italian pop tunes that include enduring classics, like one version of an eternal summer hit, “Sapore di Sale” (“Taste of Salt”), which was written by famed Italian troubadour Gino Paoli. Another renowned maestro, Riccardo Muti, cited his “friendship and admiration? for Morricone. Muti on Monday recalled that when he directed the composer’s piece “Voci dal Silenzio” (Voices from the Silence” ) the work elicited “true emotion” from the audience, both in Chicago, where Muti directs the symphony orchestra, as well as during a performance in Ravenna, Italy. Muti called Morricone an “extraordinary” composer both for films and in classical music. Asked by Italian state TV a few years ago if there was one director he would have liked to have worked with but didn’t, Morricone said Stanley Kubrick had asked him to work on “A Clockwork Orange.” But that collaboration didn’t happen because of a commitment to Leone, Morricone recalled. Morricone is survived by his wife Maria Travia, whom he cited when accepting his 2016 Oscar. Married in 1956, the couple had four children, Marco, Alessandra, Andrea and Giovanni. ___ Biographical material for this report was contributed by former AP correspondent Alessandra Rizzo."

As in other journeys toward recognition, equality and freedom to be, the world has come far, and not far enough. And as always, there are arguments about which way to go. June may be over. But television goes on, and we would like to propose some recent relevant series to keep the party going. One caveat: Not all that follows constitutes a party. ‘Pose-a-Thon’ Mostly a party is the isolation-shot “Pose-a-Thon,” a fundraising special featuring the cast and creators from the FX ballroom drama “Pose” that dropped on the eve of the Stonewall anniversary weekend. Offering songs and stories and testimonials, with a brief history of Stonewall from showrunner Steven Canals, the show makes a point of declaring that the “queer liberation movement was begun by black and brown trans women,” the very people at the heart of “Pose.” ‘Visible: Out on Television’ TV has indeed made progress in the intervening years, if stumbling along the way. Last year brought a same-sex marriage on the PBS cartoon “Arthur,” while the May series finale of Netflix’s “She-Ra and the Princess of Power” made explicit what fans already understood, that it was a long arc lesbian love story. The five-part documentary “Visible: Out on Television,” which premiered on Apple TV Plus in March, reaches back to the earliest days of the medium and gives a pretty thorough account of how LGBTQ people have been portrayed and employed across the decades — from invisibility to subjects of (invariably misguided) analysis, to objects of censure and pity and low comedy, to fodder for concerned social comment and big drama. A running theme of “Visible” is that we should look for ourselves reflected in popular culture, how what we find or fail to find changes us and how in the absence of real representation, we look for what we can adapt and use. LGBTQ characters have moved from guest shots to supporting parts to central roles — to being played, in the bargain, by performers whose identity matches the character’s — as queerness has become something not always worth comment in and of itself. This too raises issues in a still imperfect world — as Times TV editor Matt Brennan pointed out in his piece on the series, the arc toward justice will require more bending. ‘Disclosure’ “Visible” pairs well with (and overlaps) “Disclosure,” a Netflix documentary specifically about trans actors and images, directed by Sam Feder and narrated and featuring “Orange Is the New Black” superstar Laverne Cox. Its view is less historical — though it supplies ample context, back to silent film — than it is concerned with the present and immediate future. Autobiographical, philosophical and political at heart, “Visible” and its contributors are erudite, articulate and disinclined to simplify. ‘Welcome to Chechnya’ HBO has put up a pair of documentaries that demonstrate in different ways the effects of homophobia. The just-premiered, ironically titled “Welcome to Chechnya” is an on-the-ground documentary shot in 2017, when authorities in the Russian Federation republic waged war on its LGBTQ population. They carried out what has been described as a “purge” — allegedly making arrests, torturing citizens to name other citizens, encouraging “honour” killings and generally trying to will difference out of existence. It feels shockingly medieval. The film, directed by David France, focuses on a group of underground activists smuggling refugees through halfway houses and out of Russia to countries willing to take them. It has all the elements of a classic escape film and is often difficult to watch, both for the subject matter and cinematic tension. But it is not without hope. ‘Bully. Coward. Victim. The Story of Roy Cohn’ Seven minutes into the first episode of “Visible,” legal attack dog Roy Cohn turns up next to U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy at the televised Army-McCarthy hearings, which, among other things, targeted LGBTQ people as security risks during the so-called Lavender Scare. Broadcast to an audience of some 80 million over its run, the hearings introduced the fact of homosexuality to television and, one would suppose, to much of America. Cohn is never heard from, or, for that matter, talked about, in “Visible,” but HBO’s excellent “Bully. Coward. Victim. The Story of Roy Cohn” discusses him at feature length. The film takes its title from a panel in the AIDS memorial quilt that director Ivy Meeropol and her father happened upon. It was a moment of particular significance for them, as Meeropol is the granddaughter of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, whom Cohn helped send to the electric chair; he also was, significantly, a closeted gay man, who would die of AIDS complications. A high-living social climber who made it a point of honour to pay as few bills as possible, and no taxes, Cohn was a mentor to Donald Trump, if that word may be used in such a negative context, and an attorney for various organized crime figures. Cohn died in 1986, and Meeropol’s film offers a picture of a gone world — a time when gay culture was influencing the mainstream, without the mainstream quite recognizing that fact. (Cohn was a regular in gay-friendly Provincetown, Mass., and at Studio 54.) Given the Rosenberg connection, “The Story of Roy Cohn” is remarkably even-handed, nearly sympathetic and more than a little sad. Cohn may have been a villain, but he was a victim not only of HIV but also of his generation. In hiding his sexuality, even as he was dying, his case was little different from that of actor Rock Hudson, who died of AIDS complications a year before Cohn. Both were 59. ‘Hollywood’/‘Now Apocalypse’ A fictionalized young Hudson, played by Jake Picking, is a central character in Ryan Murphy’s Netflix miniseries “Hollywood.” It’s an alternative-history postwar fantasy in which fear of a gay Hollywood is overcome as early as 1947, giving Rock the happy beginning, and we assume the ending life denied him — or he denied himself in life. It is a weird mess of a show that works best taken not quite as seriously as it wants to be. But it works as a kind of camp art film — something along the lines of Gregg Araki’s exuberant, future-camp, polysexual, porn-adjacent sci-fi farce “Now Apocalypse,” a Hollywood fable of a different sort. Starz sent it into the world last year. But the glossy, madcap first season is still available to stream, and worth seeking out. ‘A Secret Love’ For a lovely documentary take on the theme, see “A Secret Love,” which debuted on Netflix in April. It tells the story of Pat Henschel and Terry Donahue, a lesbian couple who didn’t reveal the nature of their relationship until they were in their 80s. Made by a family member, Chris Bolan, it’s moving not only for its somewhat reluctant, matter of fact intimacy but also for its sweep. The film takes in their younger lives with photos and home movies that capture a full domestic, romantic and social life in a time when exposure might mean ruin, even imprisonment. That Donahue was a member of the all-American Girls Professional Baseball League, the one pictured in “A League of Their Own,” is a historical bonus."

He was 67. The news was confirmed by his friend, actress Liliana Greenfield-Sanders, and others on social media. “He was the funniest person on the planet,” she wrote. “I will miss him terribly.” The Los Angeles native was born in 1952 and graduated from the American Film Institute in 1975. After working with Anne Bancroft on two projects at AFI, he was introduced to her husband, Mel Brooks, and became his assistant on the 1977 film “High Anxiety.” Cornfeld went on to work with the couple on several more projects and got his first executive producing credit on Brooks’ 1980 film “The Elephant Man.” In the early days of his career, he produced “National Lampoon’s European Vacation” (1985), David Cronenberg’s “The Fly” (1986), Steven Soderbergh’s “Kafka” (1991) and Guillermo Del Toro’s “Mimic” (1997). He also had bit parts in several movies including “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” in which he played the Pirate King of Captain Hook Fish ’n’ Chips. In 1999 he teamed with Stiller to launch Red Hour Films, under which they enjoyed success with the comedies “Zoolander” (2001), “Duplex” (2003), “Starsky & Hutch” (2004), “Dodgeball” (2004), “Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny” (2006), “Blades of Glory” (2007) and “Tropic Thunder” (2008), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Robert Downey Jr. and won best comedy at the Broadcast Critics Film Awards and the Hollywood Film Awards. “A really great person left the planet today,” Stiller said on Twitter. “Stuart Cornfeld ... was my friend, producing partner and creative confidant. He knew movies, made movies and loved movies. World = less better without him.” Toward the end of his career, Cornfeld produced Jack Black’s 2017 film “The Polka King” and did some work in television. He was awarded the Franklin J. Schaffner Alumni Medal by AFI in 2013 and most recently produced the documentary “Have a Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics” for Netflix. He is survived by his ex-wife, Johanna Went, and sisters Lois and Ellen."
128,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/entertainment/movies/2020/07/03/hamilton-review-you-say-you-want-a-revolution.html,‘Hamilton’ review: You say you want a revolution,['A.O. ScottThe New York Times'],"Fri., July 3, 2020","The opening scenes of the filmed version of the Broadway musical “Hamilton,” which started streaming on Disney Plus on Friday, pull you back in time to two distinct periods.  The people onstage, in their breeches and brass-buttoned coats, belong to the New York of 1776. That is when a 19-year-old freshly arrived from the Caribbean — the “bastard, immigrant, son of a whore” who shares his name with the show — makes his move and takes his shot, joining up with a squad of anti-British revolutionaries and eventually finding his way to George Washington’s right hand and the front of the $10 bill. But this Hamilton, played with relentless energy and sly charm by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the music, book and lyrics, also belongs to the New York of 2016. Filmed (by the show’s director, Thomas Kail, and cinematographer Declan Quinn) in front of a live audience at the Richard Rodgers Theater in June of that year, the movie, while not strictly speaking a documentary, is nonetheless a document of its moment. It evokes a swirl of ideas, debates, dreams and assumptions that can feel, in the present moment, as elusive as the intrigue and ideological sparring of the late 1700s. “Hamilton” may be the supreme artistic expression of an Obama-era ideal of progressive, multicultural patriotism. Casting Black and Latino actors as the Founding Fathers and their allies was much more than a gesture of inclusiveness. The show’s argument, woven through songs that brilliantly synthesized hip hop, show tunes and every flavour of pop, was that American history is an open book. Any of us should be able to write ourselves into it. Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the Treasury and an architect of the U.S. banking system, was Miranda’s chosen embodiment of this belief: an outsider with no money and scant connections who propelled himself into the centre of the national narrative through sheer brains, talent and drive. Miranda shares some of his hero’s ambition and intelligence, and turns Hamilton into an avatar of modern American aspiration. “Hamilton” is a brilliant feat of historical imagination, which isn’t the same as a history lesson. Miranda used Ron Chernow’s dad-lit doorstop the way Shakespeare drew on Holinshed’s Chronicles — as a treasure trove of character, anecdote and dramatic raw material. One of the marvels of the show is the way it brings long-dead, legend-shrouded people to vivid and sympathetic life. The close-ups and camera movements in this version enhance the charisma of the performers, adding a dimension of intimacy that compensates for the lost electricity of the live theatrical experience. The glib, dandyish Thomas Jefferson (Daveed Diggs) is a perfect foil for Hamilton: his rival, his intellectual equal and his sometimes reluctant partner in the construction of a new political order. The duplicitous Aaron Burr (Leslie Odom Jr.) may be the most Shakespearean figure in the pageant, a gifted man tormented and ultimately undone by his failure to make himself matter. Not that public affairs are the only forces that move “Hamilton.” I haven’t forgotten the Schuyler sisters, who have some of the best numbers and who somewhat undermine the patriarchal, great-man tendencies inherent in this kind of undertaking. Angelica Schuyler (the magnificent Renée Elise Goldsberry), the oldest of the three sisters, is a freethinker and a feminist constrained by the narrowness of the options available to women of her time and class. Her sister Eliza (Phillipa Soo), who marries Alexander, is saved from being reduced to a passive, suffering figure by the emotional richness of her songs. Still, the personal and the political don’t entirely balance. The biographical details are necessary to the structure and texture of the show, but it is fuelled by cabinet debates and pamphlet wars, by high rhetoric and backroom dealing, by the glory and complexity of self-government. “Hamilton” is motivated, above all, by a faith in the self-correcting potential of the American experiment, by the old and noble idea that a usable past — and therefore a more perfect future — can be fashioned from a record that bristles with violence, injustice and contradiction. The optimism of this vision, filtered through a sensibility as generous as Miranda’s, is inspiring. It is also heartbreaking. One lesson that the past few years should have taught — or reconfirmed — is that there aren’t any good old days. We can’t go back to 1789 or 2016 or any other year to escape from the failures that plague us now. This four-year-old performance of “Hamilton,” viewed without nostalgia, feels more vital, more challenging than ever."
129,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/entertainment/movies/2020/07/03/unsolved-mysteries-returns-because-2020-isnt-scary-enough.html,"‘Unsolved Mysteries’ returns, because 2020 isn’t scary enough",['Alexis SoloskiThe New York Times'],"Fri., July 3, 2020","“Unsolved Mysteries,” the alternately chilling and far-out docuseries that returned to TV this week, began with a solved one. In the fall of 1982, William Catterson, a New Jersey father of two, failed to return home from his fast-food job. His car was found, abandoned. A chocolate cake, an anniversary present for his wife, still rested on the passenger seat. Two years later, writer and producer Terry Dunn Meurer included his case in an HBO documentary: “Missing Persons: Four True Stories.” Catterson, who had faked his own disappearance, saw it. He turned himself in to police, then reunited with his family. “And I was like, ‘Wow, that’s interesting,’” Meurer said. She and her producing partner, John Cosgrove, began to imagine a series that would not only televise have-you-seen-this-person enigmas and criminological riddles but maybe also crack them, too. “Unsolved Mysteries” debuted on NBC in 1988 as part of a late-’80s tabloid TV boom and endured for decades on various networks and cable channels. It had murders and missing persons. Also ghosts, Bigfoot and assorted UFOs. A cadaverous Robert Stack hosted. Eerie theme music gave even hardened viewers the heebie-jeebies. A pick-and-mix format alternated melodramatic crime stories and supernatural thrillers, arguably presaging both pulpy newsmagazines like “Dateline” and paranoid dramas like “The X-Files.” Now Netflix has brought it back. The new “Unsolved Mysteries,” which reunites much of the original creative team, debuted Wednesday with a six-episode batch, to be followed by at least six more instalments later this year. It arrives in an America it anticipated: a crime-obsessed, conspiracy-minded nation with increasingly subjective notions about truth. The format has changed, but the blend of fact and folklore remains. It is a combination that risks trivializing actual crimes by juxtaposing them with wilder content and legitimizing the uncanny through proximity to fact. Not that the creators see it that way. “We like the mix,” Meurer said brightly. “We’ve always thought of ourselves as a mystery show, not as a true-crime show.” From the beginning, competing impulses powered “Unsolved Mysteries”: a crusading compulsion to seek justice and a market-driven need to entertain. The show leaned heavily on reliable tabloid conventions — lost loves, missing heirs, unexplained deaths, medical mysteries — and many of the segments varied first-person interviews with best-guess re-enactments, some of them lurid. Paranormal cases and alternate histories made the counterfactual (a conspiracy theory about Martin Luther King Jr.’s death, Bigfoot) into just another puzzle. “We just came up with every single type of mystery that we could think of: UFO, paranormal, ghost stories, miracles, past lives, psychics,” Meurer said. “We just mixed it all in with the crime.” On NBC, “Unsolved Mysteries” began with a disclaimer: “This program is about unsolved mysteries. Whenever possible, the actual family members and police officials have participated in recreating the events. What you are about to see is not a news broadcast.” So it was not news. Not exactly. But as crowdsourced detection, the series worked. In the ’80s and ’90s, as an episode aired, viewer tips would pour into the show’s call centre. Of the solvable mysteries — a missing child, say, or unidentified remains — the show counts more than 260 as resolved, a clearance rate of about 34 per cent. (“Bigfoot isn’t necessarily solvable,” Meurer said.) Some of those solutions came via viewer tips. After a Friday night broadcast in 1988 about fugitives Missy Munday and Jerry Strickland, a flood of calls had already led to their arrest by Saturday morning. After nine seasons on NBC, the show moved to CBS, then to Lifetime in an attenuated form, then to Spike, which repackaged old episodes and added Dennis Farina as a tan, tough-guy narrator. The Spike stint ended in 2010, but “Unsolved Mysteries” did not disappear. Its website and cold case forums remained open. Old episodes popped up, unofficially and then officially, on YouTube. Amazon began streaming them in 2017. Meurer never gave up on a revival. “There’s always mysteries that need to be solved,” she said. When the hit Netflix drama “Stranger Things” premiered in 2016, she noticed tweets and Facebook posts comparing that scripted series, which is set in the ’80s and goes big on the paranormal, to “Unsolved Mysteries.” So she brought a pitch to its producers at 21 Laps Entertainment. Shawn Levy, who founded 21 Laps, had watched the original “Unsolved Mysteries” in college, admiring the way it meshed genre mystery with character-driven story. “There’s a finite number of true iconic brands in the world, especially in the world of storytelling,” he said. “‘Unsolved Mysteries’ is a true icon.” (He also called it “the Holy Grail of IP.”) Levy, whose company has a deal with Netflix, came on as an executive producer, as did Josh Barry, president of 21 Laps. Levy wanted to honour what he called the “DNA” of the original show, though longtime viewers will immediately recognize changes. Feeling that Stack, who died in 2003, was irreplaceable, producers omitted a host. Gone, too, is the party-platter format of the ’80s and ’90s, in which calamity followed calamity, separated only by commercial breaks. Now each episode, which runs 50 minutes, give or take, centres on a single mystery. There are no commercials. These episodes — three unexplained deaths, one missing person, one wanted man, one paranormal phenomenon — move closer to traditional documentary, with fewer re-enactments and a greater emphasis on interviews and archival sources. The show assumes a somewhat more sophisticated viewer with a far longer attention span. One episode — a family annihilation chiller — is presented almost entirely in French, with English subtitles. And the producers hope that a platform like Netflix, with its global reach and its more than 180 million subscribers, many of them now homebound, may lead to more solutions. “The reach is so wide,” said Marcus A. Clarke, who directed several episodes of the new version. That reach prodded Angel Rivera to participate in the first episode, “Mystery on the Rooftop.” In 2006, his brother, Rey Rivera, went missing. His body was found a week later in the conference room of a Baltimore hotel. A murder or a suicide? The medical examiner could not say. “It’s not something that I ever readily shared with anyone,” Angel Rivera said. But he trusted the producers and described the interviews that Clarke had conducted as therapeutic. “There was a sense of peace doing it,” he said. And the show, he believes, might prompt someone to come forward with information. “We’ll get it out to more ears and eyes than we could ever possibly imagined,” he said. “For my parents, even for me, there’s that closure that we’re all looking for.” Rivera did not mind that the same viewers who will scrutinize his brother’s death can also watch “Berkshires UFO,” an episode about close encounters in the Berkshire mountains in 1969. “I think it falls in line with what the brand is about,” he said. In 2020, when politicians knowingly circulate alternative facts and conspiracy theories trend on TikTok, what does it mean for that brand to take a flexible approach to observable reality? “Unsolved Mysteries” did not create this fungible, disingenuous moment. But a show that puts aliens on the same epistemological footing as a murdered family does meet it. This is not necessarily an act of bad faith — Meurer absolutely believes in the paranormal. “I’ve always felt that way, my whole life,” she said. And Clarke, who directed “Berkshires,” is a UFO enthusiast. He mentioned the Times’ reporting on the Pentagon’s recent release of three videos, filmed by Navy pilots, that show unidentified aerial phenomena. “If at this point people don’t believe or understand that these things are real, they are in denial,” he said. Levy, who described himself as “slightly to the skeptical end of that sliding scale,” enjoyed “Berkshires UFO.” But when pushed, he said he felt less certain about the show’s accommodating approach to the supernatural. “That is something that needs to be considered moving forward,” he said. Another potential problem, for viewers if not necessarily the producers, is the show’s relationship with law enforcement. Cops were not necessarily the series’ heroes. After all, if a case made its way to “Unsolved Mysteries,” police had probably failed in some way. But agencies have historically suggested mysteries to the show’s producers and sent officers to vet tips. Like the recently cancelled “Cops,” the series makes an implicit argument for law and order with its envisioning of a dangerous, anarchic world. “We’ve always had a great reputation with law enforcement,” Meurer said. Still, an episode in this new series, “No Ride Home,” explores a botched police investigation into what may have been a racially motivated crime. In 2004, Alonzo Brooks, a young Black man, disappeared after attending a party. After a police search failed, a search led by friends and family located his body. A cause of death was not determined. In June, spurred by inquiries from “Unsolved Mysteries,” the FBI reopened his case, offering a $100,000 (U.S.) reward. “We’ve been seeing a lot of people being kind of brought to justice from old cases and this is one that really deserves it,” Clarke said. “The family deserves it.” Cynthia Bowles, a longtime story producer, thinks that the Brooks case could be solved. She also feels hopeful about the murder of Patrice Endres (the subject of the episode “13 Minutes”) and the disappearance of Lena Chapin (“Missing Witness”). “They could all shake loose,” she said. Ethical complications will not matter so much if the right tips come. If Brooks’ family — or Rivera’s or Endres’ or Chapin’s — gets answers, who will care about wiggly truth value or an outlook that sees the world through a camera lens, darkly? “‘Unsolved Mysteries’ has always represented hope,” Meurer said. “That’s why we do the show: the hope is that we’re going to solve these cases. “To me,” she added, “that mitigates the darkness.”"

A body authorities believe to be that of Rivera was found Monday morning in the lake after a days-long search, said Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub. Rivera appeared in all six seasons of “Glee,” elevating ensemble numbers with effortless harmonies and riffs while commanding a sweeping range as a soloist. As an actor, she delivered one of the show’s most compelling character arcs, transforming Santana from a textbook popular girl into a complex young woman figuring out her sexuality and coming into her own as a performer. Here’s a sampling of Rivera’s greatest “Glee” performances, from Amy Winehouse’s “Valerie” to Taylor Swift’s “Mine.” ‘The Boy Is Mine’ (season 1, episode 18) “Laryngitis” is one of the first “Glee” episodes to showcase Santana’s vocal talents, featuring one of multiple knockout duets she shared with Amber Riley’s Mercedes. While competing for Puck’s (Mark Salling) affection, the pair harmonize on a cover of Brandy and Monica’s “The Boy Is Mine.” ‘River Deep, Mountain High’ (season 2, episode 4) In “Duets,” Santana makes the strategic decision to partner with Mercedes for the glee club’s duet competition — reuniting the dynamic duo for a powerful cover of Ike & Tina Turner’s “River Deep, Mountain High.” Though they don’t end up winning, the pair rock the rehearsal room with high energy and sharp harmonies. ‘Valerie’ (season 2, episode 9) “Special Education” sees Rachel (Lea Michele) take a back seat at the Western Ohio Sectional Championship show choir competition, giving other talented members of New Directions, including Santana, a chance to shine. Onstage, Santana leads the group in an upbeat rendition of Winehouse’s “Valerie,” which secures them a spot at the upcoming regional competition. ‘Back to Black’ (season 2, episode 21) In “Funeral,” Mr. Schuester (Matthew Morrison) holds auditions for solo parts ahead of the national show choir competition, and Santana opts to sing Winehouse’s “Back to Black.” Despite applauding Santana for her smooth, stylized performance, Schuester ultimately decides that no one will be featured as a soloist for nationals. ‘America’ (season 3, episode 5) “The First Time” sees Santana lead a dazzling ensemble performance of “America” as Anita in McKinley High’s production of “West Side Story.” The number begins and ends with Santana centre stage, dancing and singing circles around her castmates in a stunning red dress. ‘Rumour Has It’ / ‘Someone Like You’ (season 3, episode 6) In “Mash Off,” Mercedes and Santana lead the all-female Troubletones in a seamless mash-up of Adele’s “Rumour Has It” and “Someone Like You.” The performance also sees Santana in a rare moment of vulnerability after she has just been outed as a lesbian. ‘Smooth Criminal’ (season 3, episode 11) In the show’s Michael Jackson-themed episode, New Directions’ Santana faces off against the Warblers’ Sebastian (Grant Gustin) for an intense duet of “Smooth Criminal.” She challenges Sebastian after the Warblers attack their former choir-mate, Blaine (Darren Criss), during a parking-lot showdown of “Bad” (which also features impressive solo work by Santana). At the end of their heated duet, Santana declares, “I was better.” Yep. ‘Mine’ (season 4, episode 4) “The Break-Up” sees Santana return to McKinley High to visit her girlfriend, Brittany. She later serenades Brittany with an intimate, tearful cover of Swift’s “Mine” before suggesting that they take a break from their relationship. ‘Cold Hearted’ (season 4, episode 16) In “Feud,” Santana confronts Rachel’s love interest, Brody (Dean Geyer), with a dynamic performance of “Cold Hearted” closely mirroring Paula Abdul’s original music video. Santana leads the dance-heavy number with the help of some students from the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts. ‘Don’t Rain on My Parade’ (season 5, episode 9) “Frenemies” is the second “Glee” episode to feature Barbra Streisand’s “Don’t Rain on My Parade” from “Funny Girl.” The first was season 1’s “Sectionals,” which sees Rachel (Lea Michele) deliver a show-stopping performance of the tune during a choir competition.

The broadcast journalist announced the news in a video on his social-media accounts, calling his two years on the TV program “an incredible time” and praising the crew and co-host Dina Pugliese. Neither he nor Citytv gave a reason for his departure. Petersen only said he’s “done for now” and “taking a little break.” A statement on Petersen’s departure from a Citytv representative said they “are always striving to best serve” their audiences “and deliver a great morning experience to ‘Breakfast Television’ viewers.” Charmaine Khan, senior manager of communications for Citytv, said they thank Petersen “for his dedication and significant contribution to ‘BT’ and CityNews” and wish him “continued success.” Khan said there are no immediate plans to replace Petersen, who joined the show in July 2018. He had replaced the role vacated by Kevin Frankish on the show, after working as a news reporter and anchor. “All good things must come to an end,” Petersen wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Won’t miss waking up at 3:30. Will miss our amazing viewers and crew.” In his video message, Petersen noted he’s “not done yet.” But for now, he plans “to sleep in for a little while,” do some sailing and hang out with his son."

But critics who expected an apology from the conservative cable provocateur for the out-of-office behaviour of Blake Neff, who worked on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” since January 2017, did not get one. He even delivered a parting shot at them. “What Blake wrote anonymously was wrong,” Carlson said Monday on his program, reading from a statement. “We don’t endorse those words, they have no connection to the show. It is wrong to attack people for qualities they cannot control. In this country we judge people for what they do, not for how they were born. We often say that because we mean it. We’ll continue to defend that principle often alone among national news programs because it is essential ... Blake fell short of that standard and he has paid a very heavy price for it.” Neff had written racist and sexist comments under a pseudonym on the message board AutoAdmit. He resigned Friday after a CNN report revealed his postings on the site for law school students that bills itself as a forum for “supporters of the marketplace of ideas and freedom of expression.” Neff shared racist and bigoted opinions on Black and Asian people, the Mormon church and immigrants. Still, Carlson had harsh words for his detractors whom he accused of revelling in Neff’s departure. “We are all human,” he said. “When we pretend we are holy, we are lying. When we pose as blameless in order to hurt other people we are committing the gravest sin of all and we will be punished for it. There is no question.” A former reporter at the Daily Caller, the conservative news site co-founded by Carlson, Neff also created multiple discussion threads where he mocked women he was friendly with on social media for sharing details about their personal lives, and engaged with posts containing racist vitriol. Neff was part of a small group of writers who help Carlson craft the commentaries he presents throughout his nightly program, which in recent months has been the most-watched program in cable news, averaging more than 4 million viewers a night. Some nights, in the current fragmented TV landscape, “Tucker Carlson Tonight” is the most watched program in all of television. Carlson is among the Fox News hosts who is regularly watched by President Donald Trump. There has even been speculation by political columnists that Carlson would be a viable Republican presidential candidate in 2024 who would carry Trump’s message of anti-immigration nationalism and economic populism. But Carlson, who first joined Fox News in 2016, has been harshly criticized for remarks he has made regarding immigrants and race. He recently scared off advertisers, including T-Mobile, Papa John’s and Walt Disney Co., from his program with a commentary in which he said the Black Lives Matters movement “may be a lot of things, this moment we’re living through, but it is definitely not about Black lives. Remember that when they come for you, and at this rate, they will.” Fox News issued a clarification of the remarks, saying the “they” referred to Democratic politicians and not Black people. Fox News hosts rarely apologize when faced with a public backlash over their programs. But the Neff comments prompted a rare rebuke from senior Fox News executives. In a statement to staff Saturday, Fox News Chief Executive Suzanne Scott and Fox News Media President and Executive Editor Jay Wallace condemned Neff’s remarks, calling them “horrendous and deeply offensive.” “We want to make abundantly clear that Fox News Media strongly condemns this horrific racist, misogynistic and homophobic behaviour,” they said in a statement. “Neff’s abhorrent conduct was never divulged to the show until Friday, at which point we swiftly accepted his resignation. Make no mistake, actions such as his cannot and will not be tolerated at any time in any part of our workforce.” Media Matters, a liberal media watchdog group that has long pressured advertisers to pull their commercials from Fox News programming, said Neff’s comments were not far from the rhetoric that showed up on “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” “His day job was writing a somewhat more sophisticated version of his online posts for Carlson’s show,” Media Matters senior fellow Matt Gertz wrote Monday. “His employment provides a clue as to how some particular obsessions of that community ended up on Fox prime time. But ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ is drenched in the talking points of white nationalists because that’s the way Carlson wants it.” But aside from online outrage, Carlson’s critics have little economic leverage to pressure Fox News to take the host off the air. For most of this year, Carlson’s program has been airing without the support of national brand advertising, as companies have defected over remarks he had made regarding immigrants and race. Nearly all of the commercials on his program are from direct-response advertisers who solicit customers through 1-800 phone numbers or websites, such as MyPillow.com. Such marketers tend to be less particular about the content of the programs where their ads run. MyPillow had four commercials on Monday’s program, which also included ads for Fungi-Nail, a toe nail fungus remover made by Arcadia Consumer Healthcare, and Pray.com, an app that serves up Bible stories. “I am not changing my advertising,” MyPillow Chief Executive Mike Lindell said in a statement. “I make my decisions based on what is best for MyPillow customers and employees.” Lindell is a staunch supporter of President Trump. Carlson has endured the advertiser exodus because he has the backing of Fox Corp. Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch, who picked the host to replace Bill O’Reilly in prime time in 2017. O’Reilly was ousted over sexual harassment allegations, for which he and Fox News paid multimillion dollar settlements to keep them from being publicly revealed."

All the pictures were of faces. All the faces were white. That wall was the first thing Kelly Park saw when she stepped through the glass front doors of the Groundlings Theatre & School in L.A. day after day in the late aughts. It celebrated the comedians who had been voted into the main company and earned the honour of being called Groundlings after a rigorous program that could last years. The wall made Park sad, and as a Black administrator at the school, she grew determined to change it. “Imagine being a young Black person walking into this place,” she said. “The wall showed you that you can’t be that.” Park resigned from the company in 2010, the wall of white faces staring silently forward as she left. From 2006 until 2016, not one member of the Groundlings’ main company was a person of colour. There is finite room in the top ranks of L.A.’s leading improv and sketch comedy groups, and the performers selected to breathe the rarefied air have long been white. This was the painful sentiment echoed again and again in interviews with 14 people of colour — past and present comedians, teachers, students and administrators at Upright Citizens Brigade and the Groundlings, prestigious comedy schools and theatres that have launched some of the biggest names in film and TV. Critics said the self-perpetuating white power structure fostered by these institutions led to the belittling and marginalizing of diverse voices, racial bias in voting for team members, and lip service to the concept of inclusion while providing little mentorship or paths for advancement to Black, Indigenous or other people of colour. “The reason you take these classes and get involved is because you want to be seen on UCB stages. It could change your struggle immensely, it’s why you do it for free,” said Robert L. Hines, a Black comedian who took classes at UCB from 2015 to 2019, during which time he unsuccessfully auditioned for UCB’s coveted Harold teams performing in marquee slots. “But every time you go it’s always the same white guys at Harold shows.” The difficulties faced by BIPOC comedians in improv and sketch comedy are neither new nor secret. But the nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism that arose after the killing of George Floyd, combined with the coronavirus pandemic and its disproportionate effect on communities of colour, have opened a larger window on these grievances. The concerns are receiving plenty of air, particularly on social media, and for what feels to many like the first time, grievances are being met with action. In early July, a group of current and former performers at the Groundlings sent an open letter to the company listing actions to “create the real systemic change that the theatre needs.” The letter said that when the theatre released a statement in support of Black Lives Matter, BIPOC performers associated with the company felt let down by “a theatre that touts itself as a meritocracy while operating like a country club.” Veteran BIPOC comedians at UCB in June launched an initiative called Project Rethink with the goal of dismantling “systemic oppression of all kinds” at the company. Included in the one-page list of goals and demands sent to management: that the powerful, traditionally white role of artistic director be broken up, that BIPOC and disabled performers must have a seat at the table where administrative decisions are made, and that they be involved in company discussions about seeking non-profit status — part of the company’s restructuring plan prior to the pandemic. “Because of COVID-19, that capitalist hamster wheel has had to stop, and there’s now time to breathe and realize what’s going on, and to make changes,” said “Superstore” actor Colton Dunn, who started working with UCB in New York City in 1999. He was one of the first teachers at the L.A. school in 2005, and he was one of three Black people out of dozens of performers. “So when UCB or Second City or the Groundlings reopen, how do we make sure they do so like phoenixes from the ashes of this old system that is infected with institutional racism?” Chicago-based Second City, which has a branch in L.A., erupted in controversy in June when an open letter from prominent alumni including Chris Redd and Sam Richardson called for an investigation of racism and sexism in the company culture. CEO and co-owner Andrew Alexander resigned June 5, acknowledging a failure to create an anti-racist environment. “There seems to be a pattern in comedy groups in general when it comes to issues of sexism and racism in how theatres are run, how casting is done and who is and isn’t getting favours,” said Geoff Ross, who took his first improv class in 2008 and has been with UCB in L.A. since 2016. Ross, who is Black, said he hopes Project Rethink will effect change, but the pandemic has caused him to reconsider how he invests his time and energy. “Is it wiser to try to get an existing organization to change and function the way you would like it to,” Ross asked, “or is it better to use your energy to carve out your own space?” Project Rethink members said their demands are being taken seriously by UCB, which was founded by Amy Poehler, Matt Walsh, Matt Besser and Ian Roberts in the early 1990s. The fact that the UCB 4, as the founders are known, are all white is not what rankles critics. It’s that a largely white male power structure has remained in place for more than 20 years. The same feeling is prevalent at the Groundlings, founded in 1974 and also an important pipeline for improv and sketch artists cast in shows like “Saturday Night Live.” Famous alumni include Will Ferrell, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig. In solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, the Groundlings posted a commitment to change on its website, including a pledge to expand diversity, outreach and scholarship programs; to be actively anti-racist as an institution; to put more BIPOC performers onstage; and to be more inclusive in its hiring practices. It also launched a “listening committee” to field concerns about racism and sexism in classrooms and on stages. “Comedy institutions have a lot of work to do because the basis of comedy was white straight male humour for so long, and everybody is trying to dig out from under that past,” said Groundlings Managing Director Heather de Michele. She said a lot of positive changes have taken place since the Groundlings instituted its diversity initiative in 2015, and she said the company has awarded more than 600 diversity scholarships totalling more than $175,000. “But I will say we have to do more and we recognize that.” The Groundlings’ 10-year white streak was broken in 2016 by Lyric Lewis. Today she is joined in the main company by two other Black performers, Leonard Robinson and Julian Gant. Members of the main company, still capped at 30, are voted in by other main company members after completing up to 18 months of weekly performances as part of an ensemble student sketch company. Rick Davis, an outside counsel for the Groundlings and a former board member who helped to formulate the diversity initiative, said the changes will take time. The goal, he said, is to have BIPOC performers represented in the Groundlings at the same level that they are represented in the community at large. In L.A. County, for example, that would mean about 49 per cent Latino, 15 per cent Asian, 9 per cent Black and 2 per cent American Indian, Native Alaskan or Native Hawaiian. Critics lament that, despite all the talent that has flowed across the Groundlings stage in three decades, you still could count on two hands the total number of BIPOC performers who have been in the main company — and have a few fingers left over. Robinson said his experience with the Groundlings has been largely positive and that the company is on a path toward meaningful change. Other critics with the Groundlings and UCB echoed his feelings, likening the groups to family and saying they want to encourage better habits and behaviours. The issues faced by these companies, they said, are not the result of villainous and overt racism at the top but rather the manifestation of the institutional racism rooted in American life. “It’s an entertainment industry problem, it’s a state of comedy problem,” Robinson said. “People are in the streets burning buildings down, literally, because it’s a problem with the history of the world — diversity and inclusion.” Robinson’s wife, Roxana Ortega, who is Latina and was a student at the Groundlings from 2003 to 2008, submitted ideas to the listening committee including striving for more transparency in the voting process, hiring a school counsellor or mediator to resolve conflicts, and creating a recruitment committee to diversify the classrooms and the stage. Like Robinson, she said the Groundlings is on a path toward meaningful change. Others, however, question whether institutions hobbled by systemic racism for so long are capable of reform — or worthy of the effort. A number of Black performers recently have built successful homes for themselves, including “A Black Lady Sketch Show” on HBO and “Astronomy Club: The Sketch Show” on Netflix, the latter from a group whose members branched off from UCB. Park, the former Groundlings administrator who also took classes there in the early aughts, called the group “the Whitelings” and said the pain and humiliation she experienced struggling to recruit and retain BIPOC students manifested in the form of general anxiety disorder and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Park said she went to comedy clubs and coffee shops in Inglewood and South L.A. and invited Black performers to come and audition. “Every single one of those Black faces was turned away,” Park said. “The board was four or five white people, and every week I’d go to the board with my concerns, and they were never addressed or talked about.” Park said she resigned after a white teacher mocked her with a racial stereotype in front of his students. That teacher, she said, was put on temporary leave but has since been reinstated and still teaches at the school. A representative for the Groundlings said the incident predates the current administration and encouraged Park to report the incident to the listening committee for further investigation. Critics and management alike agree that the problem facing the institutions, when it comes to adequate representation of BIPOC performers, starts at the bottom with recruitment and retention. Daniel Robbins, who taught at the Groundlings for four years, left in 2017 after sending a letter to the school about implicit bias that he felt was not being addressed. His letter said he could not in good conscience continue to teach BIPOC students “knowing that as they worked their way through the school, it was going to become harder and harder for them,” Robbins said. The problems are not just ideological but also financial. Improv and sketch comedy can be careers of privilege. An eight-week course of classes at UCB costs $450; a series of 12 improv classes at the Groundlings runs $525. Both companies offer diversity scholarships, but BIPOC students said financial barriers are one reason they often find themselves to be the sole performers of colour in a class or on a stage. Being “the only,” as one former student called it, has a particular set of challenges when writing a sketch. A Black writer can’t create a sketch that involves a family member, for example, unless that family member being white is the punch line. Writing your experience, in general, becomes problematic, especially when you are expected to immediately understand and react to white cultural references (think Harry Potter and Wes Anderson). Meanwhile, your own cultural references remain largely misunderstood by white performers. Misty Monroe is a former member of the Groundlings’ Sunday Company, an upper-level group of performers who are being evaluated to become main company members. She said one reason she rarely does improv is because as a Black woman, she constantly found herself reduced to stereotypes based on white prejudice. “You will be labelled a prostitute. You will be labelled ignorant. You will be labelled a criminal. You will be labelled someone who does hair,” Monroe said. “All the experience specific to my Blackness can never be reflected on that stage. I did not find white people having the same limitations that I had.” When you can’t pull from your own life experiences, BIPOC performers said, you won’t go as far in your career. White teachers can compound the problem by having a limited perspective themselves. Jasmine Elist, an Iranian American who spent six years with the Groundlings (and is a former Times employee), said that when she was a member of the Sunday Company, a teacher would give her grief every time she tried to pitch or play a Middle Eastern character. The teacher would say the characters were the same or similar, even though they were different ages and had different physical attributes and vocal cadences. “She reduced and minimized a character to the character’s cultural background, determining that one character from Iran was like any other character from Iran,” Elist recalled in an email, adding that she considered the treatment of some other cast members overtly racist. In January, Elist reported the teacher to managing director De Michele, but Elist was never told how the complaint was handled, only that it had been “taken seriously, and addressed in a timely manner.” The teacher is still at the Groundlings. De Michele said privacy rules prevented her from sharing more information. Elist raised the issue again with the Groundlings listening committee, and she had a Zoom meeting with a fact collector recently hired by the Groundlings. Management said this person will work with outside attorneys to investigate specific concerns and report recommendations for further action. Other performers said they never felt overt discrimination but microaggressions and seemingly small challenges did put them at a disadvantage. Navaris Darson, who teaches diversity workshops and core-track improv classes at the Groundlings, said that when he was a student, he had to drive to Crenshaw to buy his own high-quality wigs while white classmates could save money by sharing wigs. Little things like that add to a larger sense of frustration and go largely unnoticed by white teachers and performers, he said. Darson, who has been involved with the diversity committee since its inception, said he has high hopes that the company is on the right track, and he gets emotional thinking about his love for his fellow performers. “I wouldn’t have a career if it wasn’t for the Groundlings. It’s more than just a job for me. Those people are my family,” Darson said. “I really do trust them to do the right thing.” Doing the right thing, however, can have pitfalls, critics said. A focus on diversity can swiftly become a matter of optics, said UCB writing partners Eileen Soong and Julie Hoang. The Asian American women have been on the same writing team since 2018 and had developed a great writing dynamic and relationship, they said, but they were recently broken up. The reason, they heard: Keeping two Asian women together on a team would be perceived as racist. Soong said race never would have been part of the discussion about two white writers. “It feels like we were broken up to diversify the other teams,” Hoang said. “That just shows there aren’t enough diverse people to begin with.” BIPOC performers must find and champion one another within the community in order to thrive, but mentorship can be lacking. Shaun Diston, who has been with UCB since 2008 and is one of the comedians behind Project Rethink, said BIPOC performers must work five times as hard as other performers to get to the top. Once there, they can get picked up for jobs in Hollywood and move on quickly. (Hollywood, he said, checks in now and again looking for BIPOC talent when it’s trendy to do so.) But the churn means that UCB regularly has a diversity gap, and promising students of colour are sometimes moved up in the ranks before they are ready. “After that well-intentioned move, they end up floundering because there’s no support,” Diston said. “They get spit out in a way that feels like, ‘You don’t value my diversity, you’ve used it, the joy has been crushed out of it.’” The devaluation of BIPOC students as performers can be particularly bad during the audition process, when 20 white people are in a room analyzing a performer who may be traumatized by the unconscious bias and microaggressions of those same people. Diston said he would go to these auditions as a judge and try to voice his opinions, only to be told that it wasn’t the time to talk, or that what he said was wrong. “If my voice isn’t going to be heard, I’m not going to sit here so that you can say there were Black people watching the auditions,” Diston said. The Times repeatedly reached out to UCB Artistic Director Christine Bullen and Academic Director Johnny Meeks for comment. Meeks did not respond, and Bullen said she was no longer qualified to speak on behalf of UCB because her continuing role with the company was undetermined. She said she wholeheartedly supports Project Rethink. In mid-June the UCB 4 issued a statement to company members that as of Aug. 1, the founders will no longer handle day-to-day operations of the school and that once they received non-profit status, they would hand over control of UCB theatres to a new board of “diverse individuals.” It is unclear who these individuals will be, but Project Rethink has plenty of ideas."

Soulpepper Theatre’s “The Brothers Size” took five awards in the general theatre division while “The Mush Hole,” from Kaha:wi Dance Theatre and Young People’s Theatre, took an equal number in the young audiences division. The next biggest winner was the Canadian Opera Company’s “Rusalka,” which took four prizes in the opera division. The awards were handed out by the Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts in an online ceremony. “The Brothers Size,” a play about two Black brothers in the Louisiana bayou by Oscar-winning screenwriter Tarell Alvin McCraney (“Moonlight”), won Outstanding Production, Outstanding Direction for Mumbi Tindyebwa Otu and Outstanding Feature Performance for Daren A. Herbert. It also won for costume design and lighting. The other winners in the general theatre division included Tarragon Theatre’s “Buffoon” by Anosh Irani, which took Outstanding New Play and Outstanding Lead Performance for Anand Rajaram. Soulpepper’s “Almighty Voice and His Wife” won for scenic design and “Julius Caesar,” from Groundling Theatre and Crow’s Theatre, for lighting design. “The Mush Hole” is the nickname for the Mohawk Institute Residential School in Brantford, which operated as a boarding school for Indigenous children from 1829 to 1970. The theatre production of that name, based on interviews and writings by survivors, won both Outstanding Production and Outstanding New Play as well as Outstanding Direction for Santee Smith, who also created it. It also took Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble and projection design. The award for individual performance in the young audiences division went to Malindi Ayienga for Young People’s Theatre’s “You and I.” In the musical theatre division, the prizes were shared among six productions, with “Caroline, or Change,” from Musical Stage Company and Obsidian Theatre, and “Ghost Quartet,” from Crow’s Theatre and Eclipse Theatre Company, taking two each. “Caroline” claimed both the performance awards, with Jully Black winning Outstanding Lead in her musical theatre debut and Vanessa Sears taking Outstanding Feature Performance. “Ghost Quartet” won for direction for Marie Farsi and lighting design for Patrick Lavender. Named Outstanding Production was David Mirvish’s “Piaf/Dietrich,” while Bad Hats Theatre’s “Life in a Box,” by Landon Doak and Matthew Finlan, took Outstanding New Musical. Eclipse Theatre’s “Sunday in the Park With George” and Young People’s Theatre’s “The Adventures of Pinocchio” rounded out the category with awards for musical direction and choreography, respectively.

Although an exact date for performances to resume has yet to be determined, Broadway producers are now offering refunds and exchanges for tickets purchased for shows through Jan. 3. “The Broadway experience can be deeply personal but it is also, crucially, communal,” said Thomas Schumacher, chairman of the board of The Broadway League, which represents producers. “The alchemy of 1,000 strangers bonding into a single audience fuelling each performer on stage and behind the scenes will be possible again when Broadway theatres can safely host full houses,” he added. “The safety of our cast, crew, orchestra and audience is our highest priority and we look forward to returning to our stages only when it’s safe to do so.” Broadway theatres abruptly closed on March 12, knocking out all shows — including 16 that were still scheduled to open — and postponing indefinitely the Tony Award schedule. Producers, citing health and city authorities, previously extended the shutdown to June 7 and then again to Sept. 6. In London, producer Cameron Mackintosh has said his company’s West End productions of “Hamilton,” “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Mary Poppins” and “Les Miserables” won’t reopen until 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., has cancelled most previously announced performances and events through the end of 2020, as has the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston. Broadway grossed $1.8 billion (U.S.) last season and attracted a record 15 million people. Producers and labour unions are discussing ways theatres can reopen safely. The latest extension wipes away many shows planned for the fall. Many have just moved to next year, including a revival of “The Music Man” with Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster that was to start rehearsals on June 29 but will now open in May 2021. Shows that were to open this spring have abandoned their plans, including “Hangmen” and a revival of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” A production of “The Minutes” by Tracy Letts and “American Buffalo” by David Mamet will arrive on Broadway in Spring 2021, opening exactly one year after their originally scheduled opening dates."
136,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/entertainment/stage/2020/06/22/canadian-opera-company-calls-off-fall-schedule.html,Canadian Opera Company calls off fall schedule,['Garnet FraserToronto Star'],"Mon., June 22, 2020","The Canadian Opera Company has cancelled all of its in-person performances and events slated for this fall, including “Parsifal” and “The Marriage of Figaro,” due to continued limits on travel and large gatherings in Toronto in the battle with the COVID-19 pandemic. The company’s production of Wagner’s “Parsifal” will be rescheduled for the 2022/23 season. “Marriage of Figaro” is simply cancelled. Also falling victim to the new rules is a popular free noon concert series and other events.  The remainder of the COC’s 2020/21 season is, for now, intended to proceed as planned, with Bizet’s “Carmen,” Verdi’s “La Traviata” and more still scheduled for January through May 2021.  The company’s spring 2020 season was cancelled in March as the pandemic arrived in Canada.  Since then, COC general director Alexander Neef said in Monday’s release, it’s been pondering what its near future could safely be, but “opera gathers talent from all around the world to work together in close quarters, requires an extensive rehearsal schedule, plenty of advance planning and — to remain economically viable — an auditorium full of people, without whom no live performance is complete.  “Taking all of these factors into account, plus the many unknowns around public health guidelines in the fall, this was the only viable course of action to ensure the continued safety of our artists, staff and audiences.” The COC Ensemble Studio will continue to develop Canada’s top young opera artists by working remotely as required. The company says that in recent months its trainers have used digital resources to deliver vocal, diction, language, dramatic and performance kinetics coaching among others. The cancellation of the COC’s first production of “Parsifal” will “come as a disappointment to many,” Neef said. “This production caps a decade-long, community-led effort to stage Wagner’s final work here.” A recently commissioned production of “Fantasma,” by COC composer-in-residence Ian Cusson with libretto by Colleen Murphy and intended for young audiences, will be moved from December to sometime in spring 2021. The company is working to create webinars, interactive programming and other educational material in a digital format.

But there’s one number I’ve been avoiding: the one produced by the bathroom scale. Of course, I don’t need the tool of infinite disappointment to let me know what’s going on with my physique. My clothes have been fitting a little bit tighter in recent weeks, even by the lax guidelines provided by my current everyday wardrobe of sweat pants and a T-shirt. They pair well with my uncut hair, unshaven face and perpetually under-showered body. There’s little doubt I’ve made some poor dietary and lifestyle choices during the pandemic: it’s been an onslaught of bread baking, big-meal making, ordering in and overindulgence. Being surrounded by my children 24/7 – and I love them dearly – has Daddy reaching for the “happy juice” most evenings. And that’s only if I don’t start drinking in the afternoons. My exercise regimen, long the counterbalance against my vices of consumption, has taken a hit as well. While I did plenty of road biking early in the spring, the novelty of the long solo ride has worn off. Group rides with my cycling club – a great motivator to stay in shape so I can keep up – are still on the provincial government’s no-go list. I understand why but I miss them. The whole situation is doubly disappointing because I was doing so well. In January, I went to a largely plant-based diet and hauled my butt to the gym four or five times a week. Not only did the scale go down but I felt better than I had in years. We went to Mexico in March, just before things went into lockdown. It was always going to be a cheat week of sorts, a brief return to my gourmand and beer-guzzling ways. But it was a stressful trip – the government said we should come home just days after we left – and we returned to quarantine and a world forever changed. My cheat week has now lasted three months. It would seem I’m not alone in my struggles. The internet is calling this trend the “Quarantine 15,” a riff on the “Freshman 15” weight gain prevalent in first-year college and university students. (I did that, too!) While it’s easy for me to use the pandemic as a handy excuse for my return to excessive consumption, I hardly need much encouragement. Eating and drinking what I want, when I want, in the quantities I want has always been my default and preferred setting, no matter the consequences. It takes effort and discipline for me to do otherwise. I’m also cutting myself some slack – and I’m certainly not judging anyone else who might be struggling with these same challenges. These are unprecedented and difficult times and sometimes it’s just about doing whatever gets you through the night. (For me, it’s usually a snack and a glass of wine.) But I’m going to try to go back to some semblance of moderation and a healthy(ish) lifestyle. It’s not so much about the scale or the clothes as it is about just feeling better about my choices. Even with COVID, the world does not appear to be ending immediately and I’d like to be a part of it for a little while longer – especially if I get to keep wearing sweatpants every day."
138,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/life/advice/2020/07/10/in-the-garden-plants-with-spider-connections-a-welcome-addition.html,In the Garden: Plants with spider connections a welcome addition,['David Hobson'],"Fri., July 10, 2020","There are spiders in my garden, and that’s a very good thing. They have their role to play in controlling troublesome bugs. Sadly, too many people neither like them nor appreciate them and the sight of a spider can quickly turn an arachnophobe into a clumsy tap dancer. Before you know it, they’re hopping and stomping around. That’s not a good move in a garden.  Just saying the word spider can set them off, so I avoid pointing out any plants that have spider connections, and I have at least three in my garden. The smallest is a succulent, Sempervivum arachnoideum. There, the species name should tip anyone off.  The common name might not mention spiders but the sight of a clump of these plants that appear to be covered in spider webs often causes a few wrinkly noses. It’s because of the white, hairy webbing that covers the green rosettes that they’re called Cobweb Hens and Chicks. I have a couple of pots filled with this succulent and, like other hens and chicks, it’s hardy enough to stay outside over winter — providing the pot is. Cleome hassleriana is another plant that might provoke a reaction, by its common name and by its appearance. It’s known as cleome and just as often called spider flower or spider plant. It doesn’t have webs, but the individual flowers do have long, threadlike stamens that resemble the legs of you know what. Even the seed pods can be mistaken for cute little spider bodies. Despite the name, this tall, leggy plant with its large, intricate flowers is excellent in the back of a perennial border. Cleome self-seeds, but never enough to be invasive. Plant it once and it will usually return each year. There are a few varieties that range in colour from white to pink through lilac, and many are bicoloured. If there is a drawback, cleome have slightly thorny stems; however, there are hybrids available like ‘Senorita Rosita’ that are without thorns — except they don’t self-seed. The last in my trio of panic-inducing plants is a summer-flowering bulb called Ismene fetalis, or yes, the white spider lily. This plant is a beauty and mine are flowering now. Ismene aren’t hardy enough to grow year-round in the garden, although they could be planted there for the summer. In a flower bed or a planter or pot, Ismene grow best in moist soil in full sun to part shade. Mine are growing in pots in a rich, well-drained soil and I water them frequently. If the soil is allowed to dry out, there’s a chance the highly fragrant flowers will fail to bloom.  These plants grow from a bulb much like amaryllis and are just as exotic looking. In fact, they’re distantly related and have similar long, straplike leaves. I treat them much the same way as an amaryllis bulb by letting the foliage die naturally. I store the bulbs over winter and start them off again in spring.  Without going into its forebears, this particular Ismene is a hybrid of similar species that grow naturally in South America. Ismene, once a popular girl’s name, is sometimes sold as Hymenocallis and bulbs are usually available in spring. As for that spidery sobriquet, I suppose it’s because of the appearance of the flower, although I can’t see much resemblance myself. The other common name for Ismene is Peruvian daffodil and it does have a look of a raggedy daffodil but with long wispy stamens that, like the cleome, could be seen as spidery. Ignore the name, I say, and appreciate the flowers — and do try to appreciate those other things.

Can I just start carrying a purse and please not have it be a big deal? Are we there yet? Have we, as a society, permitted average, middle-aged, unfashionable, doofussy kind of guys to carry a small bag for our stuff? Honestly, I am struggling. When I go out on errands, I am walking to and from the car with a phone, wallet, glasses case and face mask just as a start.  Often, I am also juggling some or all of lip balm, hand sanitizer, a charging cable, a receipt for something I’m returning to the store, something I’m returning to the store, a pack of gum and a water bottle. This isn’t packing for a two-month wilderness adventure. This is just routine, hey, let’s go shopping kind of stuff.  It’s not so bad in the winter when we wear coats with all kinds of pockets. There are pockets in the sides, pockets on the chest, pockets inside the chest, they’re everywhere. But it’s tough jamming all this stuff in when all I have are my jeans or shorts.  When we go out, my wife grabs her purse, hops in the car and she is ready to roll. I carry my stuff out, try not to drop it, then stick it all in every available door panel, cup holder and console opening I can find. When we get to where we’re going, I have to do it all in reverse.  It’s basically yoga. Or Cirque du Soleil. Watch as I pull a Costco card from my wallet while transferring sunglasses from my face to a case and eyeglasses from a case to my face all while dodging shopping carts and people walking while eating giant ice creams because people at Costco do not have any awareness that there are other people around them. Seriously. I once had to give the, “Ahem. Can we just sneak through here?” to a group of Costco shoppers standing in the middle of an aisle having a chit chat while my daughter and I were trying to carry a bright red canoe past them.  A canoe. Like a full-sized, three-person boat. Didn’t see it. I used to have two solid solutions to my abundance of stuff to carry problem — 1. Cargo pants and 2. Cargo shorts.  I could stuff all of my accessories and necessities into my leg pouches and off I’d go, baggy, saggy but satisfied.  But quite a few years ago, my wife put me in the no-cargo-pant zone.  I don’t even know what the big deal was but one day she vented on me. Like, it got pretty emotional. And it was all about cargo pants and cargo shorts. She didn’t like them and she told me so. She didn’t say it, but I felt like it was a “cargo pants or me” kind of conversation so, of course, I donated my cargo wardrobe and have never purchased pants or shorts with more than five pockets since. Life really is hard. When I go to work, none of this is a big deal. I fit everything into my work bag. It’s not a purse. It’s an over-the-shoulder bag with lots of zippers and pockets for my laptop, cables, iPad, pens, Rolaids, handwipes, a little sanitary mouthguard thingy in case I have to give First Aid to a stranger, my McDonald’s frequent coffee card plus all that other stuff I described above. OK, it’s basically a purse.  But I only carry it when I’m going to work. I don’t think I could carry it through the mall. Why? Why do I feel this way? Am I old? Am I set in my ways? Am I a bad person because I am too hung up to carry a purse? I also don’t believe that I am the only one wrestling with this issue. I can’t be. I’m not the only guy in the world with stuff to carry and not enough pockets to handle the job. If anyone can help me, if anyone has an answer, please let me know. I’ve been carrying this baggage for far too long now. I need something to put it in."
140,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/life/local-history/2020/07/10/flash-from-the-past-famous-20th-century-private-eye-is-rooted-in-kitchener.html,Flash From the Past: Famous 20th century private eye is rooted in Kitchener,['rych mills'],"Fri., July 10, 2020","Which Kitchener author has sold the most books? * Incorrect guesses have ranged from Edna Staebler (Schmecks) to David Morrell (Rambo); from David Chilton (Wealthy Barber) to Mabel Dunham (Trail of the Conestoga). The actual winner isn’t readily recognizable because only four early novels bore his real name — Kenneth Millar. His primary nom-de-plume is more familiar — Ross Macdonald. But his private eye’s name gives the game away — Lew Archer. Through 18 novels, numerous short stories, radio productions and several films (two starring Paul Newman as Lew Harper), Archer became the dominant private investigator during the late 1940s to mid-1970s And Archer’s roots curl back here to Kitchener. Biographies by Tom Nolan, Matthew Bruccoli, Paul Nelson and Kevin Avery cover Millar’s entire career. Each outlines the Kitchener years but Nolan devotes 40 pages to an exhaustive look at Ken’s Kitchener world ... and it’s not a pretty picture. Growing up with dysfunctional, separated parents, Millar (1915-1983) spent several periods in Kitchener, as well as California, Vancouver, Medicine Hat, Winnipeg and Wiarton. In 1920, Annie Moyer Miller brought young Ken to her mother’s house at 32 Brubacher, a dour, repressive environment that Ken evaded as much as possible. Not quite a stereotypical juvenile delinquent, Ken could be labelled a juvenile bookworm delinquent. He frequented pool halls, gambling rooms (yes, even in 1920s Kitchener) as much as bookstores and the Kitchener Public Library (KPL). The most famous story — perhaps apocryphal although I prefer to believe it — combines both sides of his addictions. One day at MacCallum’s billiard parlour/newsstand he discovered a hard-hitting crime novel by Dashiell Hammett. Later, he asked KPL’s Mabel Dunham why Hammett’s books were not stocked. They were, she said, but in a restricted area not accessible to the public. While Ken’s intellectual mind was outraged, his criminal mind was engaged. After closing, he snuck in, found KPL’s restricted area with authors such as Faulkner, Hemingway, Flaubert and Hammett and grabbed an armful. On the way to grandmother’s home, he symbolically dumped them into a sewer. For two years, Ken attended Kitchener Collegiate during which he contributed to the school yearbook, the Grumbler, as both author and literary editor. In 1931, his first published story “South Sea Soup Company” was a Conan Doyle send-up featuring “Herlock Sholmes.” In 1932, he was listed on the Grumbler’s editorial staff and in “Zuider Zee” introduced “Philo France,” to lampoon Philo Vance, a popular New York gumshoe. His final Grumbler story, “To the Damned Their Due,” featured an escaped murderer parachuting from a plane only to perish on hydro wires. After graduating, although motivated by teachers such as Cy Philp and Bill Archer, Ken had no immediate prospects so spent a year working on a farm. Fortunately for his future — and the future of literature — Ken’s feckless father died in May 1933 and his insurance policy bought Ken four years of college. During his sole year at Waterloo College, he contributed numerous articles to the school’s paper The Cord. Realizing that the small college’s faculty knew less than he did, Ken transferred to Western in London for a five-year course in history and English. Again, his knowledge of literature outpaced his professors. The day after graduating from Western, Ken and Kitchenerite Margaret Sturm married and one year later they had a daughter, Linda. Further studies at the University of Michigan led to his doctorate and eventual recognition as one of that university’s all-time outstanding graduate students. Ken and Margaret lived and wrote in California until they died in 1983 and 1994. Three times, they returned to hometown Kitchener, 1948, 1955 and 1971. Locally, only the Kitchener Public and University of Waterloo libraries have circulating copies of Nolan’s book but there are new and used copies on the internet where numerous sites also detail his private and public lives. Although he dropped his surname, it accompanied Ken’s writing career step-by-step: his wife Margaret (Sturm) Millar actually authored more mystery novels than her husband over a longer time, 1941 through 1986. Footnote: * I realize the definition of “Kitchener author” is a moving target: born here? lived here? moved here? educated here? family roots here? Take your pick, but Kenneth Millar can answer yes to four of those five."

This year is different. With lockdown wiping out a third of their 2020 operating hours, the pandemic nearly forced their permanent closure.  “We were done,” says Kristine Mathers, restaurant co-owner. “We had accepted it.” Their location at Sunset Villa, partially obscured by a stone wall, doesn’t attract foot traffic. With fixed monthly costs of four to five figures (exclusive of rent), after temporarily closing, they borrowed money (including receiving the federal Canadian Emergency Business Account loan) to keep afloat.  While the Sunset Villa Association waived three months’ rent, without knowing when or how they could reopen, the restaurant’s owners — Mathers, her brother, Jacob Beck, and his partner, Joanne Moyes — weighed their options. “We’re only two years old and had startup debt; we’re still just making minimum wage doing this,” says Mathers. “Being a small business, it’s all personal debt. We fully decided we were going to have to close.” In one form or another, there’s been a restaurant at Sunset Villa since the 1950s. The association’s board reached out and got a deep dive into the restaurant business before launching a two-week GoFundMe campaign. They raised more than $120,000 by June 1 and then, with the help of a local business owner, reached an agreement allowing the restaurant to reopen for the foreseeable future. “That was absolutely huge for us. We can’t operate out of guilt and passion and all of those wonderful things that drive things forward but then leave us in a ridiculous amount of debt.” Before the pandemic, Canada’s food service sector was expected to grow to $77.5 billion; revised outlooks now predict a precipitous drop, some saying to $38.4 billion (where it was in 2003). Razor-thin margins, sometimes bringing in only a few dollars per table, leave many Canadian restaurants struggling: 10 per cent closed within a couple of weeks of lockdown; currently, 60 per cent operate at a loss and 50 per cent risk permanent closure by summer’s end. There are layers to partially reopening under emergency orders. Without clear official guidelines, The Danish Place owners have turned to industry association Restaurants Canada for information. Additional expenses (disposables, sanitizing supplies, staff) need to be paid for while their 90-seat dining room is closed and patio is reduced to 20 seats. They’re requiring face coverings and physical distancing but returning to work, and increased exposure risk, means friends removed themselves from Mathers’ and her young daughter’s in-person circle.  The Danish Place’s website has detailed instructions on placing orders for pickup and making patio reservations. Right now, they’re open for a few hours on Saturdays and Sundays and they’ve edited their menu to smørrebrød (open-faced sandwiches); hot meals are in the works.  While perfect for a picnic, I grazed on the House Special Platter ($40), a lined cardboard flat that could easily feed four, over a few days. Slices of rye and French bread. Piles of savoury, rustic house-made leverpostej (pâté) with bacon and mushrooms; velvety, fatty rullepølse (cured pork belly) with aspic; tender, sliced frikadelle (meatball); waves of roast beef; gorgeously pongy esrom cheese, and, since I can’t have salmon, little bouncy poached shrimp.  Pots of butter, mayonnaise, vinegary herring, vibrant puce pickled cabbage, mustard-kicked remoulade, and crunchy pickles. Smear the bread, layer the topping and dot with pickle, sliced onions or bell peppers. I’m sure there are rules but when you’re under a tree or at your desk, build and eat your sandwich as you will. That week, they made Jordbærgrød, a lightly sweetened strawberry compote ($6). I ate it as recommended: cold, with a lashing of heavy cream. Summer in a bowl. Navigating the complexities of what used to be and what’s needed now is the hallmark of these Inbetween Times. Hopefully, we will find that sweet spot, because sweet spots like The Danish Place are hard to find.

Apart from my own sites, my byline appeared on well-known ones and now-defunct ones. I authored a white paper for a popular appliance manufacturer. Local and national media interviewed me a few times. I gave talks about food history and appeared on discussion panels on both sides of the border.  After my first Record review ran, a local acquaintance told me I shouldn’t write under my name and every picture of me should be removed from the internet. He didn’t think I should be recognized as the author of my work, although my white colleagues were credited for theirs. I politely ended my reply with, “I’m not easily erased.” He abruptly ended the exchange. I wasn’t surprised. I was born in Kitchener, grew up here, and got my degree from the University of Waterloo. Like other visible minorities, I’m well acquainted with the area’s casual and overt racism: Kids in school called me the N-word. Sales clerks follow me. Restaurant servers try to deny service. We see hate platformed, read gaslighting comments, and hear fauxpologies. Whenever someone demands to know where I’m “really” from, I’m reminded that to some, being Canadian is only skin deep.  That sense of who can and cannot be Canadian is woven into the national fabric. For Canada’s first 100 years, immigration policies prioritized those who could easily blend into colonial culture. Policies and regulations created an unofficial colour bar that throttled immigration from China and India. While not legislated, Wilfrid Laurier’s cabinet approved banning Black immigration. Japanese Canadians’ voting rights were withheld until 1949; Indigenous Peoples didn’t receive universal suffrage until 1982.  Shifting public attitudes of the 1960s led to Lester B. Pearson’s government overhauling our immigration system. Applicants earned points for things such as education, work skills, and language skills; race wasn’t supposed to be a factor. A few years later, in 1971, Pierre Trudeau adopted the Bilingualism and Biculturalism Commission’s recommendation to make multiculturalism national policy.  But reversing a century of systemic racism doesn’t happen overnight.  Black Lives Matter has laid bare deep-seated biases against Black people and other marginalized groups, with conversations turning to how these attitudes flow in the undercurrents of our daily lives: salaries and promotions, social media moderation, how we think about food. I know I’m a rare flower in that I’m a bylined, paid, freelance food writer, who happens to be of South Indian ancestry. This field is traditionally populated by white writers focused on urban, white, bourgeois diners. These writers often elevate certain cuisines to three-star haute status while they devalue immigrant cuisines to cheap eats, particularly when made by immigrant hands. They’ll blur regional foods into Chinese, Latino, and Indian abstractions, and coo over the curiosity of “ethnic” foods, when gentrified or appropriated by white personalities. Contemporary food writing isn’t entirely fogged by exhausted views. Independent voices and staff writers, like some now at The New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, and Food & Wine, don’t necessarily look like, think like, or eat like their predecessors and are more reflective of their communities and generations. While some continue the aspirational chase for “the best places,” others unearth compelling stories in tasty places. Condescending eyes aren’t cast on diasporic cuisines or their labour. Restaurants and chefs previously fawned over aren’t automatically slid easy praise.  Change is difficult, especially after decades of magazines, newspapers, radio, and TV reinforcing cultural biases. Some eaters are flummoxed with opinions, voices, or faces that don’t fit the old mould. Without reading my work, a woman told me I’m unqualified to write about “white people’s food” because I wasn’t raised on it. When I said that must also mean white people who weren’t raised eating Japanese, Chinese, Thai and other non-European cuisines weren’t qualified to write about them, she mumbled something and walked away.  I’ve been told restaurants in Waterloo’s University District — a young area, chockablock with diasporic cuisines often cooked by non-white hands — aren’t “worthy” of review. Patronizing comments like “who can eat this?” echo sentiments about stinky, spicy, unclean foreign foods. My foodways writing spotlights cuisines our neighbours bring with them, but some insist those aren’t “the most important” ones. As one person said, “we don’t eat like this.”  But we do.  More than 50 years after immigration reforms, Waterloo Region’s population includes more than 220 ethnicities and one in five of us identify as a visible minority. How we think of ourselves should evolve with our community. How we tell today’s stories — from business to arts to sports to culture to food — should reflect who we are now. Not who we were in the decades before I was born. Not who those in far-off glass towers think we are.  We may not have eaten like this in 1950, but we do eat like this in 2020. Because that’s who we really are."

My mother would vacuum my room as I lay there, apparently in her way. And my dad would hose off the exterior of my bedroom window as a supposed part of his weekend morning home maintenance routine. The sound of a water jet hitting glass is quite startling, if you were wondering. We have taken a more relaxed approach to parenting around here, although I had a very difficult time not jumping up and down on my daughter’s bed the Saturday morning that we planned to order in brunch from the Korner Kitchen. It was all part of some special mother/daughter time I had been scheduling to try to add a little cheer to the week that should have included her prom.  The two of us had eaten at their appealing new restaurant in Waterloo on what became her last day of high school, and nearly the restaurant’s last day being open for regular business. It felt like coming full circle when I called to put in our order and discovered they were hoping to soon reopen their patio for diners. We are big fans of breakfast in this family and Korner Kitchen has just the menu for us. They also have plenty of lunch items, along with daily specials. I dithered a bit over the menu because I couldn’t decide between sweet and savoury. A day without maple syrup is like a day without sunshine, but I ended up with the best of both worlds when my daughter and I added a Belgian waffle ($8.29) to share as a side. We definitely ordered more than we could eat, but I knew we would enjoy the leftovers. I was very happy with my choice of the Canadian Eggs Benedict ($13.50). It derives its name from the inclusion of pea meal, or Canadian bacon, which is layered with poached egg and melted cheddar cheese, all on top of a toasted English muffin and smothered with delicious Hollandaise sauce. It was tasty and satisfying, and came with two side dishes. The hash brown potatoes at Korner Kitchen are a thing of beauty. The potatoes are grated nice and thin, salted and cooked to crispy perfection. I also had the fruit salad, which was quite large and incorporated two types of melon, three types of berries, bananas, kiwi fruit, pineapple, and grapes. My daughter’s BLT Deluxe Sandwich ($10.50) was so generously sized that the sides of hash brown potatoes and baked beans had to go into a separate container. The sandwich was made with bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, smashed avocado, two fried eggs and garlic mayo, all between toasted whole-wheat bread. She also really enjoyed the hash browns and smaller portion of baked beans. The waffle we shared was light, airy and accompanied by a whipped topping. I added my own maple syrup, of course. The final dish we sampled was the Berry Salad ($16.95). I was looking to add a little fresh greens to our meal and it didn’t disappoint. This salad is a satisfying meal in itself — and came with a grilled breast of chicken on the side. There are plenty of toppings including berries, toasted sliced almonds, pieces of walnut, crumbled goat cheese and I chose a balsamic vinaigrette for my dressing.  Last but not least, we each ordered a Tropical White Herbal Tea ($3.25). I would describe it as having the aroma and flavour of a delicious island-themed cocktail, but in tea form. The other three members of my family are not going to read this review with quite the same enthusiasm as my daughter and I felt eating our brunch, but they can rest assured we will be ordering in again soon from Korner Kitchen.

Pizza? Wings? Battered deep-fried pork balls with gloopy dayglo red sauce? According to Uber Eats, butter chicken topped national doorstep drop-offs during our housebound heyday. While poutine came in second, more naan than fries zipped down our streets and more shawarma than onion rings. The rest of the list — miso soup, pad Thai, bubble tea and edamame — tells a story of how we’re eating now: More than half of us born after the mid-1960s were already used to scrolling and clicking to fill our bellies before March. Also, surveys reveal the younger we are, the more likely we’ll fill our plates with foods our parents and grandparents won’t eat. It seems as our understandings and experiences broaden, so do our palates. A friend and I have a decade-long on-again-off-again conversation about Indian restaurants. I grew up eating the best South Indian food in Waterloo Region — note: my mum’s cooking is the best. That’s not up for debate — while my friend is giddily incandescent about a place that’s … lacking. A few months ago, she shoved a takeout menu for Sahar’s Kitchen into my hand and implored, “This place is so much better. You have to try it. You have to.” It was like she switched from Android to iPhone, Coke to Pepsi, the Leafs to, well, anyone.  Sahar’s Kitchen’s familiar collection of foods hopscotches across the Indian subcontinent. Along with those rooted in Bengali, Chettiar, Goan, Mughlai and Pakistani traditions, others are from the Anglo-Indian canon. With a family story that stretches from Pakistan to Bangladesh to Hong Kong, Majid Maqbool joined his wife, Jhorna, in Kitchener in 2015. Before this, he was cooking at a family restaurant in Hong Kong.  The plan was always to return to the restaurateur life here. Two years ago they opened, naming their restaurant after their now four-year-old daughter — Sahar means dawn’s light. Here, the couple, along with Mian Maqbool Sabry (Majid’s father), turn out some fine dishes from the cosy restaurant’s kitchen.  Unlidding containers reveals complex aromas and flavours buoyed by texture and colour. Rivulets of brick red oils swirl atop luscious crimson and russet gravies. Spices speckle pallid sweet sauces. Textures wander from firm to sticky to voluptuously soft. The Butter Chicken’s ($15.99) chunks of breast meat are tender and swathed in a rounded, rich, tomato gravy. Unlike the tinned tomato soupiness that’s sometimes found elsewhere, its light sweetness doesn’t overpower. The King Prawn Chettinad ($17.99) is punchy with a pleasantly creeping heat that doesn’t overpower. The gravy’s depth is boosted from the firm tail-on shrimp — here, the gravy is to be sopped up.  For okra fans, the Bhindi Bhaji ($14.99) combines firm and slippery chunks with slithers of silky onion, fried in mild spices. There’s a mild tang to the Bharta’s ($14.99) soft mash of grilled eggplant from the tomato masala.  Mixing the wet and dry dishes into the nutty, aromatic Basmati ($3.99), jeera rice flecked with grains of saffron rice, brings everything together. The soft, bubbly Garlic Naan ($3.99) — blistered from the tandoor and scattered with chopped garlic and coriander — is perfect for sopping up puddles of gravy. Soaked in sweetened rosewater-scented cream, the Rasmalai’s ($2.99) cheesecake-like paneer is moreish. And whether you call it kheer, payasam or Rice Pudding ($2.99), the loose, butter yellow pudding is flavoured with cardamom and studded with cashews. Both are needed desserts for hot nights. There was a well-spaced queue of customers and delivery drivers spilling onto the sidewalk when I picked up dinner. Business has been steady throughout COVID-19 and I can see why. The Maqbools turn out tasty, fresh-made foods in Kitchener to satisfy faraway cravings.

145,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/life/food-wine/review/2020/06/11/dining-in-gayuma-catering-serves-asian-fusion-from-the-heart.html,Dining In: Gayuma Catering serves Asian fusion from the heart,['Alex Bielak'],"Thu., June 11, 2020","Given the positive online buzz about Gayuma Catering’s takeout Asian fusion dishes, and how fast they sold out, I was delighted when I finally successfully placed an order. Everything about the place seemed happy, from the jaunty logo, incorporating chopsticks and noodles into the letter G, to the upbeat social media posts, often featuring the radiant owners.  Katrina Tioco came from the Philippines in 2006 as a caregiver, and still has family there she supports financially. She eventually worked as a nanny for Canadian-born Jinny Song, whose ancestry is South Korean. That’s how Song came to appreciate just how good a cook Tioco is.  Two years ago, Song convinced Tioco to do some food pop-ups at the bubble tea shop she manages. She was certain people would love her now-friend’s cooking, saying “I really wanted to get her food out there. She never believed in herself, but I did. She’s the sister I never had.”  Not long thereafter, they started Gayuma, originally catering to tech sector companies. With corporate offices closed because of COVID-19, they lost all their clients. “We still had family to support and rent to pay, so we changed our business model very quickly, beginning with a Facebook post. It was slow in the beginning: the first week we had just 10 orders, but it grew each week and we are now at capacity every weekend. We are so grateful. In a way, it was a blessing in disguise.”  Tioco says her grandfather served as the inspiration for the name Gayuma. During the ’60s, impatient customers lined up at his restaurant, pressing him to tell them what made his food so special and worth the wait. He told them he cooked everything from scratch, with all his heart, and that was why they were there. The Filipino word Gayuma, “that which attracts,” encapsulated his offerings.  She says that is the way she cooks now. “I can’t speed it up, and people are so patient with me. I decide what to cook once I’m at the grocery store. And I’ve had to accommodate all sorts of allergies, so have had to find alternative ingredients that can work in the dishes to substitute for things like peanuts. Guided by her grandmother during Facebook chats, she’s found various Asian herbs and seeds that can serve as replacements, while keeping the dishes tasting right.”  Dodging summer downpours, I picked up my order at the back of a small strip mall off Weber Street. A small sign by a nondescript door directed me to call to get my order. Once the door opened, there, above the masks, were those same smiling eyes I had seen on Facebook. I was the last client of the day, so the ladies had time to chat before closing.  Tioco’s actual sister — another radiant smile beaming from the back of the store — was responsible for folding each of the 20 dumplings that comprised part of our order. Half beef, half pork, with garlic, shallots, salt and pepper, they were delicious in Tioco’s signature, a beautifully clear and garlicky, 48-hour chicken soup. The accompanying ginger soy sauce also provided contrasting flavour.  Song told me that Chap Chae is a sweet potato glass noodle Korean dish, more savoury than spicy. She said Tioco makes it better than she can, adding the highest of praise, “it’s like my mother’s.” The ground beef was marinated overnight with sesame oil, soya sauce, brown sugar, crushed garlic and pepper, before being sautéed with green onion and added to the noodles. A small container of brought-in Sriracha allowed for a bit of heat for those so inclined. I could frankly have done with the protein being a bit more prominent among the other ingredients — peppers, carrot, shiitake mushrooms, spinach and sesame seeds — but that is the merest of quibbles.  The copious and truly satisfying meal — consciously made affordable by Tioco and Song to give back to the community during COVID — was most enjoyable. Everyone was keen to order again, and I’ll certainly be watching out for what is on offer each week, and for what the future holds for these joyful entrepreneurs.

146,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/life/travel/2020/07/10/pandemic-has-travellers-rediscovering-the-open-road-and-camper-vans.html,"Pandemic has travellers rediscovering the open road, and camper vans",['Mike SeelyThe New York Times'],"Fri., July 10, 2020","Harley Sitner was in  Brooklyn for a wedding in March, feeling as if he’d just been sprayed by a skunk. Sitner’s hometown, Seattle, where he owns a camper-van restoration, repair and rental business called Peace Vans, was the site of one of one of the first huge coronavirus outbreaks. “People were like, ‘Stay away,’” he recalled. Back home, with peak road-trip season approaching, his employees reported a rush of cancellations on rental vans. Sitner had just hired a “super-awesome” marketing manager and began thinking he might have to lay her off. School was cancelled, and all but the most essential businesses were ordered to shut down. Sitner was compelled to give his employees a month off, save for a skeletal crew that stuck around to perform essential services like repairs. “We were looking at some pretty significant revenue black holes,” he said. Then, in mid-April, the phone started ringing in the repair shop. “People started thinking they’d have a summer and wanted their classic Volkswagens looked at,” Sitner said. But it wasn’t just that. There was also a run on a new line of modern camper vans his company had announced with Mercedes-Benz at the Chicago Auto Show in February: produced by a third-party manufacturer called Driverge, sleeping four apiece, and starting at $93,000 without kitchen and cabinetry, $120,000 with. “We sold like 28 of them in 30 days,” Sitner said. “Some people are saying they’re not getting on a plane for two years or never going to Europe again.” Sitner is 52, with a 10-year-old daughter named Eden Peach. In person, he projects a tender, Michael Stipe-ish vibe, wistfully remembering that “until recently, we hugged so many of our customers” and brewed espresso in the shop’s front office. He became acquainted with Peace Vans as a customer, running his Vanagon (a.k.a. the Volkswagen T3) in and out of the shop, in Seattle’s industrial SoDo neighbourhood, between jaunts to Burning Man. In 2013 he learned from the shop owner that he planned to close the business, and Sitner persuaded him to hand it over instead. Over the years, Sitner has served clientele from aging hippies to Instagramming millennials, and all political persuasions. (In the lot of Peace Vans there was an old VW bus from Iowa awaiting restoration with a National Rifle Association sticker on the driver’s-side window and a painting of the word “Peace” on the side panel.) But the venture with Mercedes, which began casually after he began buying the chassis of the brand’s Metris van from a dealership down the street, has brought a new kind of buyer, Sitner said. Ed Stevens, a 51-year-old tech entrepreneur in Dallas, had planned to take his wife, Robin, and two adult children scuba diving in the Caribbean when the pandemic took hold. The virus’s spread, he said, was the reason he started looking to buy a camper van. “We cancelled the reservation and hunkered down, and then I started thinking, ‘I can work from anywhere, Robin’s taking a class online, and we thought we’d just cruise the whole country,” he said. “As soon as I saw the official partnership between Mercedes and Harley, that was the motivating factor.” (“The idea of building on a Nissan or a Ford light van did not meet the quality bar we wanted,” Sitner said, explaining his choice of chassis.) Mark and Linda Kimlin had just spent the winter in Spain before returning to New York City in mid-March, feeling “very lucky to escape unscathed,” said Mark Kimlin, 63. But New York was itself about to get scathed, and with the lease up on their Upper East Side apartment, the Kimlins hightailed it to a home they owned in New Paltz, north of the city. (They expect to return to the city when things “settle down,” Linda Kimlin, 65, said.) Their daughter had planned to get married in California in July (the celebration has been postponed, although not the ceremony) and, Mark Kimlin said, “it seemed like a good time for wide-open spaces and not getting on an airplane.” His son-in-law-to-be had driven a simpler version of the Metris camper van and shared his positive experience with Kimlin, who bought one from Peace Vans on the strength of that recommendation and the fact that his wife “likes camping, but with a comfy bed.” Talk to any camper-van owner and they’ll tout the relatively small size of their vehicles compared to traditional RVs and the taller Mercedes Sprinter vans that many Amazon delivery drivers whiz around in, explaining that the more compact Mercedes Metris and VW Vanagons are easily usable as second cars in dense neighbourhoods in major metropolitan areas. But they’re also great for when a wildfire jumps the highway and bears down on your house — the precise scenario Naomi Neilson stared down in mid-June at her house in Shell Beach, California. “Everyone was like, ‘Where are you going to go?’ And I was like, ‘I don’t know, I’m going to take my van and go,” said Neilson, 46, who owns a Metris camper van and runs a bathroom-fixture company called Native Trails. “I just threw some food and drinks in the fridge and was ready to go. It took me 10 minutes. I went down the coast a little way and just relaxed. I didn’t end up needing to evacuate for the whole night, but it was nice to be able to just throw a couple things in there and know I had a place to sleep and cook for as long as I needed.” Of course, this is something owners of Volkswagen Vanagons have taken comfort in for decades. While Metris owners like Ed Stevens never considered buying such a lovable relic of hippie culture because he “didn’t want to be spending two days somewhere while my transmission gets shipped in from God knows where,” VW owners like Brian Kolonick of Cleveland think the hassle’s worth it because, he said, “my kids think I’m cool for a minute.” “It’s the way it smells, the way it drives, the way people look at you — you’re bringing them some level of joy,” said Kolonick, 42, who works in digital health for a company called Conversa in Portland, Oregon. He rented a Vanagon from Sitner before he bought one and said some VW scenesters turn their nose up at him because he “can’t repair things” and has to call a mechanic. He’ll often visit Vanagon forums online, where he occasionally finds diehards dissing the Subaru engines in some custom conversions, arguing that they’re “taking away from the slow-running intensity” of the stock motor. And it’s fair to surmise that some VW devotees think Metris owners are a tad soft. “We have friends who have them, and I’ve got to admit, we joke about their vans,” said Jim Samuel, 58, a real estate agent and University of Oregon grad in Seattle who named his 1991 Vanagon “Bertha,” after the Grateful Dead song. “But it comes down to people, ultimately.” Joayne Andrews agrees. A 72-year-old retiree, she lives in Cathedral City, California, just east of Palm Springs, and has owned 26 Volkswagens in her lifetime, four of them vans. A Jetta is her daily ride, but when she really wants to get away, she’s got a 2000 Eurovan at home and an ’82 Westfalia stashed in Seattle that Sitner’s crew has been restoring for the past two years. When she visits friends up and down the West Coast, she thinks her vans make her a better houseguest. “It’s nice to be able to pull into their driveway and not take up space in their house,” she said. “We’ve got our own little studio apartment.” As for the Metris campers, her neighbour has one, and Andrews thinks “they’re lovely.” She then added, “They’re superexpensive, but probably with what I had to have my van restored, I could have bought one.”"

Read']","Fri., July 10, 2020","Thames Valley Trail allows you to explore nature in the rural countryside and in the heart of a large city. The Thames Valley Trail follows a meandering 130-kilometre path along the Thames River, one of southern Ontario’s major waterways. The river’s three main branches — known today as the North, Middle and South Thames. The trail follows these branches through diverse habitats in the Carolinian Forest Region, in which a wide range of plant species thrive. In spring, populations of trilliums and other wildflowers explode in the forests, while the pungent smell of early-blooming skunk cabbage permeates the air in swampy wetlands. In open areas, you’ll find everything from meadow herbs to cultivated crops. The North Branch and South Branch meet at The Forks in the heart of the City of London, and flow through downtown parks. Thanks to these green spaces, urban wildlife, from rabbits and groundhogs to white-tailed deer and coyotes, flourish. The sight of an eastern spiny softshell turtle sunning itself along the muddy banks is a special treat. With its pancake-shaped leathery shell and long, pointed nose, this threatened reptile is extremely distinctive. Much of its habitat has been lost to shoreline development, so Ontario’s softshells are left to depend on sites like the Thames to survive. There are many spots from which hikers can access the trail along its length. Start at London’s Ivey Park, follow the river northward to Harris Park, and then cross the river at Blackfriars Street. Wander the opposite bank back south to Riverside Park. Kensington Bridge returns you to your starting point. The St. Williams Conservation Reserve is part of the Norfolk Sand Plain, a delta that formed on the northern shore of Lake Erie after the retreat of the last ice age’s glaciers. Early pioneers eventually settled much of this land, clear-cutting populations of native trees and plants over time and exposing the sandy soil to the elements. The St. Williams Forestry Project was established more than a century ago to grow and plant seedlings in an effort to stabilize what had effectively become desert areas. As one of the first projects in Canada, it serves as a model for subsequent initiatives. Made up of oak woodland, oak savannah, forest, wet- lands and sand barrens, the St. Williams Conservation Reserve is located on Crown land within the Long Point Biosphere Preserve. With more than 1,000 hectares at two sites, the reserve is a multi-use area that supports a great number of Canadian species at risk. Today, it is being managed to restore and preserve the richly diverse Carolinian habitats and flora and fauna populations that once flourished here. While exploring the trails, keep your eye open for one of Ontario’s most beautiful and endangered woody plants, the eastern flowering dogwood. This small tree is alive with large blooms in May. Interestingly, the white “petals” on the four-parted flowers are not petals at all but bracts, a leaf-like structure that has taken on the petal’s job of attracting pollinators with their showy colour. The familiar poinsettia and bougainvillea plants share the same characteristic. Another St. Williams denizen to watch for is the eastern hog-nosed snake. When attacked, it hisses, makes a striking motion, flattens its neck and even plays dead. It’s a harmless display intended to discourage potential predators. Unfortunately, in recent years, this snake has moved from threatening to threatened as its population has declined; a research project at St. Williams is focused on how to preserve this intriguing Ontario species."
148,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/life/health_wellness/2020/07/13/i-did-yoga-in-a-plastic-pod-during-a-heat-wave.html,I did yoga in a plastic pod during a heat wave,['Serena WilloughbyToronto Star'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","There are pod people among us. They come from across the city and congregate near the lakeshore. Inside the pods, their bodies, lithe and slick with sweat, twist and contort with synchronicity, hived-off from the dangers of the pandemic. Like hamsters inside invisible wheels that go nowhere, they do mountain climbers, jacks, burpees, sweating singularly, inside the safety of their pods. No, this is not “The X-Files.” This is Lmnts Outdoor Studio  at Stanley Barracks near Hotel X at Exhibition Place. It’s yoga, Pilates and other fitness classes inside a clear plastic dome, one person per dome, 50 domes available per class. The idea is that it allows for safe, socially distanced classes with the benefits of a hot room. Those who are used to the benefits of practising in a hot room haven’t had the opportunity since yoga studios closed in March due to COVID-19. The clear plastic domes are large enough for one person, and their mat, towel and water. It creates a greenhouse effect, light and heat go in but don’t go out. Domes are preassigned and classes are prepaid, so there’s no wandering around looking for a spot, potentially spreading germs around. Everyone has their temperature taken as they go in and entry is controlled so everyone always keeps a safe distance. My first class was called “Full Body Sweat,” described as “full body circuits involving bodyweight, light resistance training and cardio.” I was worried about visibility but since the domes are clear and the teachers are elevated on a stage, you can see everything.  It was an intense workout, fast-paced with lots of cardio, working out different areas; arms, legs and abs. I was sore the next day, always a sign of a good workout but though I haven’t been in a hot studio since March, I found the heat totally manageable.  But I was really looking forward to the “Original Hot Yoga” class I had scheduled for the following day. I wanted the sequence with which I’m familiar. For this class my dome was in the shade, but since it was during a heat wave, and it was high noon it was still hot, (though I could have handled hotter.) I’ve been practising hot yoga in various forms for more than 15 years and I’ve found it’s improved my chronic back pain by promoting flexibility. I love the heat and find health benefits in sweating it out. So while I’ve been doing Zoom classes in my living room, the opportunity to get in a hot room, or something like it, was appealing. But what I didn’t realize I missed the most was my yoga community. I’ve been going to Beaches Hot Yoga for about five years and I take Inferno Hot Pilates, a HIIT (high intensity interval training) class that uses Pilates principles, as well as Hot Yoga, a series of 26 postures with two breathing exercises. Teachers there know me, they know my injuries, they know what weights I should be using and where in the room I like to put my mat. And when you go to the same classes each week, you start to know your fellow students and you develop friendships that go beyond talking about yoga and Pilates. As I settled into my dome I spotted someone I recognized from my Beaches studio. She wasn’t someone I ever talked to but I knew the face and wondered if she recognized me. I never managed to get her attention, and we were asked not to congregate after the class, but I realized that I was missing that interaction. And being in a dome, in a sea of domes just makes the sense of isolation we’re all feeling, all the more palpable. Like if something is completely off-limits you can accept that, but if it’s just out of reach, it bothers you more. Which made me sad, but maybe I’m just not a pod person. Or, as my teacher for that class Melanie Chung explained, it’s not about one-on-one connections, it’s about collective energy. “Energy is one of the most beautiful things about yoga,” she said. She says she picks up on the collective energy when she sees people are listening and following her cues. Whether in a hot room, or with the pods, she tries to get that connection to help her gauge skill levels, and she can tell when people are tuned in. So for my next class, “Hot HIIT Pilates” I tried to focus on the idea of collective energy.  It was 32C that day, the sun was high in the sky, the air was still. It was hot. Though the heat didn’t intimidate me in the first two classes, now I was worried. All of the pods have a fan though and I turned mine on low to get a little air flow. And as soon as the class started there was no time to worry about being hot.  As I tried to keep up amid the sequences of walk-outs, bridges, bicycles and lunges, I looked around at my fellow pod people. It was tough and sweaty and we were all just working as hard as we could. Some people went outside their domes and just found a spot on the grass. The class went by quickly and as I lingered in my pod to do some stretches, I saw smiles on every face as they departed. Being pushed to a physical limit creates the sense that you’ve been through something, that we were all challenged and prevailed. Perhaps this was the collective energy I was seeking. And perhaps it’s true as they teach in yoga, no matter where you are or the lengths you take to stay safe, each one of us is creating our own reality as well as the collective reality—inside and outside the pod."
149,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/life/health_wellness/2020/07/13/meredith-shaw-is-bringing-body-positivity-to-food-television.html,Meredith Shaw is bringing body positivity to food television,['Lara BucharThe Kit'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","The body positivity movement has made waves in the worlds of fashion and beauty in recent years, but one industry where it’s noticeably missing? Food television.  Style expert Meredith Shaw and her partner, chef Rodney Bowers, are out to change that with their new self-shot cooking series, “Double Your Dish,” where they transform one base ingredient into two totally different dishes in their home kitchen. While Rodney takes the lead on the cooking side, Meredith flexes her food styling and sous chef skills, and also acts as camera operator.  Beyond the delicious food, the series is noteworthy because it signals a shift in the types of bodies that are seen on television, particularly food television. “It’s pretty cool to have a cooking show with two people in bigger bodies because I don’t think you see that very much,” says Shaw. Bowers’ experience backs that up: “In the past, I was told that I wouldn’t have my own cooking show because of my size, that it’s not something that networks or sponsors want.” Where do you see the intersection between body positivity and love of cooking? Shaw: Society puts a lot of guilt on enjoying food. I hope that through the food that we make, and the style that we do it in and our passion for what we’re doing, it allows for that intersection to be even stronger and to provide actual examples of it happening in real time. Bowers: I’ve worked on many different television shows over the years as a guest cooking expert and I was often met with negative comments about being a larger man even when I was cooking healthier food. There was a weird dichotomy between a large man cooking and promoting healthier food. It sat with me for a while and I questioned how to deal with it, because I wanted to promote good, healthy, organic, balanced eating for everyone. On the flip side of that, when I would cook with lots of butter and meat, I’d get negative comments … associated specifically with my weight. I think it’s so important for people in larger bodies to show that food can be good and dynamic and tasty and healthy and fun. It doesn’t have to be associated with their body image. It can just be food that they’re cooking. What kinds of recipes do you prepare on ‘Double Your Dish’? Shaw: The series was inspired by our Instagram Lives in our kitchen, when we were preparing meals together. Once we were offered the show, we sat down, cracked a bottle of wine and said, “What do we want to cook? What do we want to show? What do we want to share with the country? What would be useful? What would be personal?” Rodney uses really simple, accessible ingredients and makes them so delicious, and shows that I — and the viewers at home — can do it, too. Meredith, you’ve done a lot of great work for the body positivity moment. How did that start? Shaw: I have always been in a bigger body and there was no word for that when I was growing up. There was no “curvy,” there was no sort of activism; it was “big-boned” or “fat.” I started off as a singer-songwriter and I had many a meeting with record executives — which I hope don’t happen now — where they’d say, “We love your voice, we love your song, but we basically don’t like what you look like.” That was hard to handle. I had a tough journey with it and I went down the wrong path for a while. I tried to be less than, tried to be smaller, and it didn’t work for me. That’s why I have such empathy and passion for helping other women through that, because it’s so much better on your own team. It’s so much better to love your body and to know that you are more than your body, and to know that your worth isn’t tied to the size of your body. Rodney, have you had similar experiences? Bowers: I think the anxiety and depression that can come with being overweight affects men as well. I definitely struggle with self-image when we’re talking about cooking food on TV. Producers have told me that it all came down to an image thing and it turned me off for a while, thinking that no matter how I present myself on camera there’s always going to be this stigma about my size that other people are going to hold me back for. But then you get over it and you prove them wrong. Meredith, how did your experiences propel your work as a fashion expert? Shaw: I think you can really express yourself with style; it’s a way of stepping into your purpose. If your closet is full of things that don’t fit and make you feel bad and shameful when you open it, get rid of that stuff and stock it with new things. I scream that from the rooftops as often as I can. I come at my role as a style expert from a real place of love and empathy as a result of my own experiences. How does that come into play on ‘Double Your Dish’? Shaw: The show is important in terms of that visibility for both men and women. Rodney is a superhot dude and I have him in great clothes on the show. He’s in bright, fashionable, co-ordinated looks that fit him well. These aren’t clothes that fade into the background. He’s owning it and conquering it, which I think is really inspiring."

Researchers from the Ottawa Hospital say they want to explore the potential of IMM-101, a preparation featuring a dead pathogen containing properties that can stimulate the “first-response arm” of the immune system. Study lead Dr. Rebecca Auer, surgical oncologist and director of cancer research at the Ottawa Hospital, says it could help experts understand why some COVID-19 patients are relatively asymptomatic while others end up in intensive care or die. “The difference, it seems, between these two different presentations has to do with how strong your innate, or your sort of non-specific, first-line defence immune system response is to the virus,” Auer said Wednesday. “And so we’re hoping that by boosting and stimulating this innate immune response, particularly in those vulnerable patients that have a reduced immune response to begin with, we’d be able to prevent symptomatic infections and prevent serious infections.” Cancer patients are at much higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19 because chemotherapy, cancer surgery and radiation treatments suppress innate immunity even further. Auer points to an “urgent need” to protect them while the world waits for an effective COVID-19 vaccine, which could take another year or more to develop, test and implement. A successful trial could also protect cancer patients against other respiratory infections as well as the coming flu season, says Auer, noting the threat of illness is a fairly big problem for those undergoing treatment. “A study demonstrated that about 13 to 15 per cent of cancer patients will have to delay or stop their treatment because of influenza during the average flu season,” she says. “And also, cancer patients don’t respond as well to the influenza vaccine every year because their immune system isn’t as strong. So we think that the IMM-101 may in itself be able to help prevent symptomatic influenza infections.” Auer says IMM-101 has also been tested elsewhere for its anti-cancer properties and that, too, will be examined in this trial, although it’s not the primary objective. The researchers say the bacteria, Mycobacterium obuense, is safe to use in cancer patients because it has been killed by heat. The Canadian study will recruit 1,500 patients currently receiving cancer treatment, and participants will be randomly assigned to receive either regular care or regular care plus IMM-101. Auer says the treatment would be administered as an injection in the arm, to be followed by two more booster shots. Researchers will follow patients for a year, watching for any respiratory infections and monitoring whether the treatment works and how long it lasts. The trials will take place in eight centres located in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec. Researchers say people interested in participating should speak with their cancer specialist. Researchers from the Ottawa Hospital came up with the idea and worked with the Canadian Cancer Trials Group at Queen’s University to design the trial. Dr. Chris O’Callaghan of the Queen’s University group notes cancer patients are also at greater risk of COVID-19 infection because they require regular medical care, making it difficult to adhere fully to public health guidelines. “These patients are unable to practise social isolation due to the need to regularly attend hospital to receive critically important cancer treatment,” says O’Callaghan, who will oversee the trial. Auer says a successful trial of IMM-101 could also suggest usefulness in treating any patient with a reduced innate immune system, such as older patients with chronic illness. She notes that the tuberculosis vaccine known as BCG — which uses a similar formulation to IMM-101 but uses live bacteria instead of dead bacteria — is being tested around the world to see if it can boost the immunity of health-care workers exposed to COVID-19. Funding and in-kind support, valued at $2.8 million, comes from the Canadian Cancer Society, BioCanRx, the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, the Ottawa Hospital Foundation, the Ottawa Hospital Academic Medical Organization, ATGen Canada/NKMax and Immodulon Therapeutics, the manufacturer of IMM-101."

That said, its popularity has been subject to the usual ups and downs associated with drink trends and, from about 1970 to 2010, it was a little less common, since many people had turned to vodka, rum and tequila cocktails like the Margarita, Piña Colada and Cosmopolitan. And, as often happens with drinks that aren’t in regular circulation, the quality of the Manhattans started to decline as a lot of bartenders simply forgot how to make one properly. It’s an easy drink to make—whisky, sweet vermouth, bitters, stirred over ice and served in a cold glass with or without a cherry—but a lot of things can go wrong if you don’t understand a few basics. First, like all drinks that are made with straight spirits, it needs to be stirred, so that it doesn’t wind up watery. Second, the bitters are essential. Third, splurge on a good Amarena cherry. Fourth, vermouth goes bad relatively quickly if it isn’t stored in the refrigerator. Finally, don’t be stingy with the vermouth. Unless, that is, you’ve left your vermouth on a counter for a month, which was exactly what happened at a lot of bars in the vodka/tequila era. On top of that, a lot of people forgot the bitters since, even though a bottle of Angostura bitters sat on the back bar of many venues like a talisman or something, few of us understood how to use them. Bitters are often called the “salt and pepper” of the cocktail world and bartenders say that, quite often, if something is just a little off on a drink and they can’t figure out what, a dash of bitters will fix it. These problems have largely been fixed in the past 10 to 15 years, thanks to the revival of traditional methods amongst bartenders who have been bringing back the classics. Speaking of tradition, the first Manhattans would almost universally have been made with American rye whiskey but, since we’re doing 100-mile cocktails here and supporting local distilleries, we’re using a Canadian alternative, Stalk and Barrel’s Three Barrel Whisky ($34.95; LCBO 13323). Since it’s made just north of Toronto, we named it after the distillery’s location—in Concord. The Concord 2 oz Stalk and Barrel whisky ¾ oz Haberdasher sweet vermouth (made in Prince Edward County) 2 dashes Angostura bitters 1 Amarena cherry (for garnish) Method: Stir all ingredients (except the cherry) together over ice in a mixing glass for 45 seconds. Strain into a chilled coupe or martini glass. Add cherry. NOTE: If you have trouble tracking down Haberdasher, Dillon’s Vermouth (also made in Ontario) is an alternative that’s available at the LCBO. And there are plenty of Ontario craft whisky options, but we wanted to shine a light on Stalk and Barrel, the province’s oldest micro-distillery, because it’s celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. They have several different expressions, including a rye and a single malt."
152,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/life/food_wine/advice/2020/07/09/yes-you-can-drink-wine-on-the-rocks-plus-one-to-chill-you-might-not-expect.html,"Yes, you can drink wine on the rocks (plus one to chill you might not expect)",['Carolyn Evans HammondContributing Columnist'],"Thu., July 9, 2020","I’m just going to say it: Yes, you can drink wine on the rocks. But there’s a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. Here’s the lowdown. When you don’t care that the ice will dilute the wine as it melts, or that the deep chill is going to mask all the subtle complexity in the wine, go ahead and toss a few cubes in the glass. Otherwise, refrain. My bet is, if you’ve dropped a generous bundle of cash on a bottle of fine wine, you’re not going to want to wreck it by watering it down and muting it. Which is why serving fine wine on the rocks is not usually a good idea. But there’s one exception. And that’s Port. That sweet, fortified wine from Portugal that’s typically associated with Christmas gifting, by-the-fire sipping and post-dinner cheese boards is actually quite fabulous in the summer served on ice. Especially with a dish of salted almonds. Here’s why it works. First off, Port is so concentrated that a little dilution isn’t going to kill the experience. In fact, it will actually enhance its drinkability. Secondly, ice ratchets up the refreshment factor and offsets the style’s considerable sweetness. And third, at about 20 per cent alcohol by volume, Port is a slow sipper. So it has time to warm up a little bit in your mouth as you drink it, giving the considerable complexity time to open, cascade and linger — even when served cold. All that to say, if you haven’t tried Port on the rocks, I’d encourage you to do so with a bottle of white, tawny or ruby Port. Here are a few favourites that offer tremendous value. White wine lovers will appreciate Taylor Fladgate NV Fine White Port (Vintages 69856, $15.95/750mL). Gleaming golden in the glass, this is a sweet, full-bodied wine made from a blend of eight white grape varieties and aged in wood for three years. Each sip saturates the palate with a blast of candied pear and orange zest, salted caramel and hazelnut, vanilla and a whisper of nutmeg. This is especially good served with a slice of orange in the glass. Score: 93 A tasty tawny to try is Warre’s Otima 10-Year-Old (LCBO 566174, $22.00/500mL). Tawny Ports are red fortified wines that have shed their deep ruby colour and turned amber, or tawny, from maturing in wood for an extended time. This version, comprised of wine aged an average of 10 years in oak, shines a deep amber hue and tastes of toffee and nuts, candied citrus and cherries, with touches of nutmeg, clove and cinnamon. It’s a sweet, satin-textured drink that goes well with the setting sun. Score: 92+ For a ruby Port that overdelivers, consider Taylor Fladgate 2015 Late Bottled Vintage Port (LCBO 46946, $19.00/750mL). Ruby Port is made from a blend of black grape varieties aged for two to six years in wood, thus retaining its deep colour. Taylor Fladgate’s version here shines dark red and unfolds with intriguing layers of fruit that taste sweet and poised yet dark. Blackberry and black licorice mingle with black cherry and cola, burnt almond and coffee, and a whisper of black peppercorn and smoke. And it’s of course long. Score: 93 If you’re inspired to whip up a batch of salted almonds to go with any of these wines, here’s my favourite way to make them. Pour three cups of raw, unsalted almonds into a bowl. Dissolve one heaping teaspoon of salt in about two tablespoons of hot water. Pour the salty water over the almonds and toss. Spread the nuts on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a 400° F oven for about 10 minutes until golden, stirring halfway through. Remove the tray from the oven, pour the almonds into a bowl, drizzle them with about a tablespoon of really good olive oil and stir to coat. The nuts will quickly absorb the oil. You can serve the almonds warm or let them cool and store them in an airtight container. And if you’ve got a bottle of fine table wine kicking around that you want to chill fast, don’t be tempted to throw ice in the glass. Instead, make an ice bath — about half ice, half water — and submerge the bottle. Doing so will chill it faster than ice on its own and you’ll be enjoying your wine nicely chilled (but not too cold or diluted) in no time."

It’s all about the atmosphere, Toronto owners say","[""Chris O'Leary Special to the Star ""]","Tue., July 7, 2020","On a quiet weekday afternoon, Will Johnston was prepping the small but colourful patio seating at the front of Duke’s Refresher + Bar on Front Street East, near the St. Lawrence Market.  For the first time in three-plus months, Johnston, the general manager of the bar, had seats available to customers. It’s just 10 seats for now, with dividers available to shield you from the person next to you. It’s a far cry from the business his bar was doing in early March, when he could expect 400 to 500 customers on a busy night and was anticipating a packed house for St. Patrick’s Day.  “We were fired up,” Johnston recalled. “We loaded up the beer, loaded up the food, got the staff all ready to go. We weren’t taking reservations or anything, but we knew people would fill up the place. Then sure enough, that afternoon (March 16), they said, ‘Hey, all restaurants are closed in Toronto.’” The 10 chairs out front are a baby step for his business, but Johnston is trying to make the most of it. Toronto moved into Phase 2 of its reopening on June 24, allowing restaurants with patios to serve customers. Duke’s got its patio up and running on June 25 and saw a 20 per cent sales increase compared to takeout sales that day a week earlier.  The takeout-to-patio-service dance is one that many restaurants in the city are navigating. But sports bars are in the difficult spot of trying to change their dance steps on the fly. Even if the NBA, NHL, MLB and MLS get off the ground in the coming weeks, there are no guarantees that COVID-19 won’t interrupt or completely derail their seasons.  The biggest issue for sports bars in Toronto will be that they need to not just be functional in Phase 2, but need to have the city advance to at least Phase 3 of reopening, when dining in would presumably become an option.  The pandemic has sports bars across the city and around the world grappling with the same issue: Can sports bars work without sports?  “Part of the draw for sports bars is definitely the sports, there’s no denying that,” said Andrew Kaiser, the co-owner of the Dock Ellis, a sports bar on Dundas West that’s been open almost seven years.  “Given the fact that more than likely it’s going to be at most 50 per cent capacity inside, filling all those seats I don’t think is going to be much of a problem. Definitely, the big sporting events helped us hit 100 per cent capacity. Now the question is, will 50 per cent capacity pay the bills without any kind of support?  “That’s a whole other question.”  Franco Tascione is the chief operating officer for social brands at the Recipe Unlimited Corporation, which owns, among others, Bier Markt. At Bier Markt’s Esplanade location, they have three patios on the property and are capable of seating about 120 people now.  The staff wear masks and every other table is left open to give customers the appropriate space. Inside, where Phase 3 and the big screens await, it’s all about creating the right atmosphere, regardless of what may or may not be available.  “If for any reason sports shouldn’t come back, that doesn’t stop us from (making the restaurant a destination),” Tascione said.  “When guests are sitting in a restaurant, you want to have that atmosphere, that excitement, that energy. Part of that excitement is created by our employees, but imagine walking into the restaurants and you have all these great employees, but none of the TVs are on, no sound is on, no music, no lights, nothing. It just feels very flat.” Tascione points out that there’s a stage at the back of the Bier Markt on the Esplanade. He sees opportunity there, too.  “Streaming live music and streaming things such as events that will create that atmosphere in the restaurant, which I think is important. If for any reason sports shouldn’t come back, that doesn’t stop us from doing all those things,” he said.  Johnston sees challenges ahead for his place and other sports bars. It will be difficult even at 50 per cent capacity when people get together and their inhibitions come down and they start clumping together. He says he and his staff will have to keep people in check. It won’t be fun, but he doesn’t want outbreaks and bar closures like we’re seeing in the United States.  “It’ll be a lot of work to try and keep people away from each other,” he said. “There’s no dancing, there’s no singing on the patio. It’s going to be like a version of ‘Footloose’ in a sense.”  The owners insist there’s still more to a good bar than the games on TV.  “People are social beings. We can’t hide from that or escape that,” Kaiser said.  “A lot of what we do and a lot of what our industry does is make people comfortable, and have people in close quarters and share memorable events, especially in sports bars. People are aching and they’re dying for that level of human contact that I think a good quality sports bar gives. “Before bars we were all sitting around a campfire sharing food and drinks anyway, right?”"
154,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/life/relationships/2020/07/13/a-short-history-of-the-word-simp.html,A short history of the word ‘Simp’,"['Ezra MarcusThe New York Times', 'Jonah Engel Bromwich']","Mon., July 13, 2020","The word “simp” isn’t new. In fact, it’s pretty old. But it has been dragged into fresh popularity. In the same way that older songs can find new audiences on TikTok, older slang emerges on the app to be championed by a broader, younger audience. Too Short, the bawdy West Coast rapper who used the word in lyrics as early as 1985, said that he was not surprised that the word is more popular than ever. “It still means the same thing,” he said. “If I was in a room with a bunch of 20-somethings or even teenagers, I would expect them to know what I’m talking about.” The Evolution of Simp Simp’s new status as a prime insult — a misogynist one, that implies a person is “unmanly” — has lasted most of a year. Mel Magazine, an online journal quick to note cultural trends, deeply dissected the resurgence in October. The “New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English,” defines it as a shortened version of simpleton, so the phrase’s original meaning is rooted in calling someone stupid. The dictionary lists its first known usage as 1946, although it appeared in The New York Times as early as 1923. The most recent entry in the dictionary dates to the 2000 novel “My Once Upon a Time,” by British novelist Diran Adebayo, where “simp” appears twice in the first 20 pages. Adebayo said he had used it to inject an old-fashioned noir tone into the book. “Simp would have been used in an old-school way,” he said. “Not the other way it’s been used as a very soft kind of man, who is very soft to his female friends.” That newer sense of the word — as an insult for being “soft” or “overly sympathetic,” particularly to women — became more prominent in the 1980s and early 1990s. A set of West Coast rappers who regularly addressed pimping, including Hugh-E. M. C., Too Short and E-40, started using it in their songs. “To me it’s like the opposite of the pimp,” Too Short said. “It really degrades the person who you’re aiming it at.” He added that it evoked the sense of something counterfeit: “Like you’re a knockoff pimp.” Too Short said that he may have drawn it from 1970s Blaxploitation movies, where the word thrived. The 1982 B-movie “Penitentiary II” even had a character named Simp. In the early 2010s, the word, still used with some regularity by rappers, was seized upon by members of the nascent “manosphere,” the world of men’s rights activism. Simp became a staple of men’s rights forums, where feminism is derided as weakening men — just waiting for an enterprising TikToker to dust it off and give it a new sheen. Do We Know Where Simp’s Going To? The word’s current definition isn’t too far from Too Short’s. It’s a person, often a man, who throws money or attention at someone else, often a woman, in order to win affection. (It doesn’t work.) That usage only became popular on TikTok in 2019 and may have peaked thanks to a trope made popular by Marco Borghi, whose account, @polo.boyy, has more than 2 million followers. On Dec. 16, he posted a video that showed him posing beneath a block of text. It read: “If she rants to you about her relationship problems and you comfort her,” while Post Malone’s “Rock Star” played. The beat switched. The chords of OutKast’s “Hey Ya” began to play and a text banner flashed: “Welcome To Simp Nation.” Borghi had been making videos riffing on the notion of simps throughout the year. But that one seems to have inspired a boom of simp content on TikTok. The @polo.boyy videos marked the first time that Sterling Fournier, 21, had seen the word on TikTok, where he himself has over 675,000 followers. He made his own video in the same format. He said he had already been aware of what it meant. “If you were out with the boys, you’d say, ‘Oh, I had such a great date with Sydney. I paid for her food,’ and then you know, like, just as a teasing word, we’d be like, ‘Oh dude, you’re such a simp,’” he said. Hope She Sees This, Bro The first wave of simp content on TikTok and YouTube was driven by men. More recently, a simp-related video trope driven by female creators has emerged. Lauren Halbach, 19, posted one such video in May. In it, her boyfriend is resting his head on her torso in bed. A song called “Simp (Simp Nation Theme Song)” starts playing. He jumps up, laughing. “I feel like my boyfriend definitely fits the context of being a simp,” Halbach said. The boyfriend-simp meme gave her the chance to turn the tables on TikTok’s alpha male culture, she said, where women are often “shamed or slammed for being too clingy or being too obsessive over men,” and men mock each other for doing “overly special things for women.” She called the dynamic “very toxic.” The ubiquity of the term “simp” has taken some of that sting out of it. Like other insults, it has been taken up by fan communities, who often refer to themselves as simps for their favorite stars. Gretchen McCulloch, a linguist and the author of “Because Internet,” a book about language online, compared this usage to terms like “stan” or “trash,” as in, “I’m trash for this.” McCulloch called it a self-conscious approach to fandom — “preemptively putting yourself down so that other people can’t,” she said. So ... It’s Sexist? Yes. The word expresses discomfort with equality when it comes to gender and offers a simple way to dismiss the people causing that discomfort. Its resurgence cuts against simplistic ideas about young people, who are often caricatured as beacons of political correctness — woke saviours arriving at a time when America desperately needs them. Fournier said the word’s edginess was part of its appeal. “I think it caught on because it was just, just within that perfect margin where it wasn’t something that you could get like too, too angry about, but it was also something that was still pretty politically incorrect,” he said. McCulloch places simp in the same category of terms as “white knight” and “whipped,” used to degrade men who are “perceived as trying to curry the favour of women.” These also crop up in the world of men’s rights activism where simp is frequently used. Adebayo teaches creative writing at Kingston University London. He said that when he saw the word in his students’ work, it reflected a character’s “backlash or irritation, or even confusion, around quite what you’re supposed to be as a man in terms of furthering your appeal to women.” “A simp is someone that puts like, woman on a pedestal,” said Tiago Garcia-Arenas, 22, a TikTok creator with more than 2 million followers who released a song called “Simp” this year. Such men, he said, see women “as a higher being, or something like that.” And Nelson Cam, 19, a TikTok user with over 150,000 followers, said that the word has also retained its economic associations. Simps, he said, are “guys that spend a lot of money on girls and get nothing in return.” “I feel like a lot of guys saw this word as an opportunity to, whenever they’re in an argument online with I guess, a male feminist or any male that’s sticking up for woman’s rights, they have an automatic weapon that they can just use,” he said. The Enduring Power of Simp Simp has linguistic qualities shared by a lot of timeless slang. It’s short, punchy and easy to pronounce. “You look at the list of words for cool — you know, ‘rad’ or ‘hot’ or ‘bad,’” McCulloch said, “a lot of them are monosyllables that have like a consonant and a vowel and a consonant.” Adebayo agreed that it benefits from sound alone. “It’s a word that sounds quite dismissive and authoritative in its way,” he said. “You can see it being kind of a useful, insulting term.” And longtime users of the word expect it to retain that meaning. “I don’t know what simp will evolve into but it will always be a negative word if you’re called that,” Too Short said."

With a quarter century of multimedia storytelling, Millgate traverses the country in search of dynamic topics, researching issues thoroughly then translating core elements via video, photo and words with credibility. Her latest project is an immersive experience which will keep her on the roads, and streams, of the Pacific Northwest all summer long. “Ocean to Idaho” debuts on social media platforms this summer. The multimedia experience offers audiences the opportunity to track the journey of migrating salmon from — as the title implies — the Pacific Ocean to the Salmon River in central Idaho, an 1,368-kilometre journey. “We have so many things going on, and so many layers of priorities, whether it be figuring out how to feed our family tonight to how we’re going to try to plan a summer vacation,” Millgate said. “And within all of that is wildlife in wild land just trying to do their thing with all of us on top of them. And, just for a minute, I can help people engage in what is going on within our natural resources, despite all the things that we’re doing on top of them.” Her outdoor adventure began at the mouth of the Columbia River in Oregon and will end at the Yankee Fork of the Salmon River in Idaho. Footage gathered during the trip will turn into a finished film plus stories for print and video media outlets countrywide in 2021. “I go stretches at a time, like 10- to 12-day trips at a time, and then I get ahead of the fish so then I can come home, hug my kids, take a shower, catch up, make sure that everything social media-wise is running because that can turn into its own separate beast.” The immersive social media campaign has been a challenge for the veteran journalist. “By having social media, we can reach these audiences in a more dynamic way that really makes them feel involved. My credibility, my accuracy, my journalistic integrity — all those things still exist, but there’s this more accessible layer there where people can engage more.” During her time at home, she writes, edits, cuts video, schedules more interviews — it’s a hectic pace. “As a reporter, it changes the expectation because they want more of the personal behind-the-scenes stuff. I get asked for more of that in the last five to 10 years than ever before. But, we’re still just real people. And so, I go on these assignments and I’m not trying to tell you how to think on an issue, I just want you to think.” Millgate hasn’t run into too many surprises on her trip yet — at least with the fish. “What is surprising me is that everything is falling into place,” she said. “I’m pulling off the impossible here, and I haven’t gotten lost. I find every spot I need to be. I find it when I need to be there. Everyone that agrees to be interviewed is in their spot when I get there. And that’s pretty unbelievable. “It’s almost serendipitous, you know? It’s like, everything that could go wrong is not going wrong.” Millgate is well familiar with the Idaho section of her journey this summer. The rest has been an exciting discovery for her. “You get me past like the very end of this migration route and I don’t know what anything looks like, I don’t know where anything is,” she said. “And so it’s this whole new world of shooting a landscape I’ve never seen and I love that. “There’s nothing boring about it when your eyes are overwhelmed with everything that’s new. I like those days. So the fact that there’s like this rain forest which is the Lower Columbia sitting in the middle of this basic desert migration route, it’s awesome.” Millgate shot a film a few years ago on the Yankee Fork of the Salmon River in central Idaho that was dredged for gold and left in ruins. There she found the genesis for her current project. “When I was in there shooting — I’d never seen a salmon. I’ve never caught a salmon in Idaho. I’ve never touched one. But I saw them in there and I thought, I’m watching them, you know basically on their last day of life and they’re guarding their spawning bed. And thinking, ‘How on earth does this fish do that and what on earth does that journey look like?’ I’m looking at a fish that just swam 850 miles to lay eggs and die. So my imagination kind of wandered: ‘What does that journey look like and how do I chart this back to the ocean?’” Then last year, Millgate severely broke her leg when she was hit by a puck coaching her kids’ hockey team. She was incapacitated for four months. “When that happens to you, and you get thrown down on the couch like that, you really have no other choice but to look at yourself and your work, and where you’re at and what really matters. And I had a lot of those things already lined up in my life. But that concept of following the fish just kind of started sticking with me.” In October of last year, she planned out how she’d pull the project off, with intricate levels of detail, lining up travel schedules and lodging and crews. But then, the pandemic hit, throwing much of the plan out the window. “When that happened, as a freelancer a lot of my work fell away instantly. And there was nothing I was going to do about that. But this project kind of hung on and it morphed into this whole other thing — ‘OK, now we’re going to stack even more odds against you. See if you can pull this off.’ And so, I dumped my flights, I dumped my hotels, I dumped crew, and figured out how to do it in a way that was safe, responsible and reasonable.” Toyota and Four Wheel Campers came through as sponsors for the project, giving Millgate self-contained transportation and lodging in one. “There was all this time between October and May where it was a total wild roller-coaster ride of, ‘OK, this is going to happen. Oh, this is totally off the table,’ to, ‘Hey this is going to happen and it’s gonna look totally different. We’re going to pull it off.’” The practicality of driving through the Pacific Northwest during a pandemic has been a challenge logistically and emotionally for Millgate. “It’s kind of interesting to travel right now, because you get a different sense of how each area is handling it,” she said. “And I’m not with people. But you can feel it. Parts of Oregon are so shut down right now that even passing through without any interaction in a certain county feels uncomfortable.” Millgate doesn’t want to give the impression she’s flaunting any of the pandemic precautions. “I’m not trying to rebel in any way, I’m just trying to bring something that’s important, and bring it in a way that’s responsible,” she said. “And frankly, sometimes it’s quite lonely. You’ve got your interviews, but then you don’t have anyone to hang out with when you go back to your camper. You work 15-hour days because that’s how many hours of light we have right now. And then you go back to your camper. And you’re camping in places where nobody is, that you’ve arranged with someone to let you have a safe place to park in their back lot, or whatever.”"

And when you add the young men who would be their escorts and backup escorts, that number more than doubles. All the work was intended to lead to The Links Inc. Chicago chapter’s 60th annual Debutante Cotillion, a formal ball where the debutantes are presented to society with the support of their escorts, family and friends. But just like proms, graduations and other milestones for young people, COVID-19 squashed this event. “The original cotillion date was April 25, but then we changed it to June 13, and then we changed it to the first weekend in August, and then we said this isn’t going to be accomplishable,” said 2020 Cotillion chair and The Links member Dr. Joy West. Originally scheduled to be held at the Fairmont Chicago under the theme of “Diamonds and Pearls,” the cotillion is now planned for May 1, 2021. “This was devastating for us, basically because of the families. The senior families in particular.” According to West, when the idea for a virtual cotillion was presented, families turned it down. “Families wanted the full experience, and they didn’t think the virtual experience could capture the beauty and grace of the moment for their debutantes, so they opted to wait,” West said. The move didn’t sit well with Havilland Williams, a rising senior at the Chicago High School for the Arts. When she mentioned to friends that she was preparing for the cotillion, she said, many of her peers weren’t familiar with the concept of the ball. She likens it to a quinceanera, but it’s not a birthday party. Cotillion is a rite of passage for young women in the Black community. It’s a tradition that has been going on for 60 years in Chicago under the guidance of the Chicago chapter of The Links Inc., the national women’s service organization based on friendship and community service. Founded in 1950, the Chicago chapter places a special emphasis on volunteering in the fields of youth services, international trends, health services and promoting African American art. “To find out school was cancelled and the cotillion was cancelled? I was really upset,” Williams said. “But what can you do?” Her escort, Lorenz King, who will be attending Morehouse College in the fall, calls the recent spate of cancellations and postponements unfair. As a St. Rita of Cascia High School senior, he trained for the ball alongside Williams but won’t be coming back to escort her. Instead his younger brother will go. “We’ll never get this again in our lives. I’ll never get to graduate high school, I’ll never get prom, and we work so hard. It’s just the feeling of accomplishment, after everything you’ve done, and you’re just not going to get it,” King said. “It gets frustrating sometimes. ... It’s kind of sad that we didn’t get a payoff of everything we did.” West said that all of the debutantes have the opportunity to walk in 2021, and while all the juniors will do so, only about four or five seniors will return from college to participate. It’s a huge miss for participants, after the community service, fundraising, classes and workshops. And let’s not forget finding the proper ball gown, which has to be floor-length and white, accompanied by white gloves. Participants raise money by selling ads to small businesses, and the cotillion class chooses a community organization to receive the money raised. The Chicago chapter of The Links focuses on mental health and wellness, West said. “Our national mission is to transform communities through service, and we feel like continuing the legacy of cotillion by providing an opportunity for our young people to witness resilience through times of unrest, is important,” West said. “What we wanted our current families and community to see is a dedication to continuing to transform communities through service. Even though our goal to give $60,000 (U.S.) back to the community for our 60th did not happen, we have recommitted to doing just that for 2021.” According to LaTisha Williams, Havilland’s mother, the cost to the family of making the cotillion happen runs in the thousands of dollars, and that includes selling $150 tickets to relatives and friends for seats at tables during the event. But Williams said it’s worth it for her only daughter to have this opportunity for education, mentorship and camaraderie. Havilland Williams and King said they not only learned etiquette, but have taken part in financial workshops about stocks and bonds as well as ones centred on mental health. Havilland Williams considers cotillion to be on a higher level than prom. “It has more elegance and grace in it and kind of like ballet — makes me feel poised and pretty, and I like how that makes me feel,” she said. “With prom, it’s just everyone is there, everyone wants to look better than you, but in cotillion, it’s more about unity.” “In the end, you just see the dancing, but there’s a lot that goes into it,” King said. “A lot you can take away from it — years down the line, and that’s why I think it’s better than a homecoming or a prom.” Camille Lonzer, a 2019 debutante from South Shore, says the event was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that she’ll remember forever. “It’s just a rush of happiness seeing everyone in their dress. ... I would compare it to a graduation or a prom because you get to show off and show out. It’s definitely exciting,” she said. “I wasn’t too much of a social person beforehand, and it sort of opened my eyes to a lot of different people who have a lot of different opinions and perspectives. But also the community service aspect of the cotillion, it was life changing for me. I think that’s a nice aspect of it because you really feel like the community needs you as a person.” “2021 will still be our 60th anniversary, although I don’t know what the flavour of that will look like,” West said. “But what we do know is that the journey to cotillion — the rehearsals and workshops — will be a fun and informative time for the debutantes and escorts. We want to make this next year just as interesting as this past year was.”"

If you’d asked for a fizz, say, 100 years ago, the bartender would have handed you a gin cocktail, since the Gin Fizz was one of the most popular drinks of the day. What made it so popular? Aside from being delicious and refreshing, having a carbonated cocktail was still a bit of a novelty. Carbonated water was invented in the 1700s, but it wasn’t until the soda siphon (a.k.a. a seltzer bottle, that made water fizzy with carbon dioxide cartridges) became widely available and affordable that bubbly cocktails became common. For home bartenders, that was in the 1920s. Fancy bars had carbonated water for making sparkling cocktails earlier. One of the most famous and flashy fizzy cocktails was the Ramos Gin Fizz, which was invented in New Orleans in 1888 at the Imperial Cabinet Saloon and, within 20 years of its creation, had become a veritable cottage industry. Some of its appeal was the spectacle of teams of bartenders shaking fizzes for exceptionally long times, which was part of the secret to getting a frothy top. The other part of the trick was adding an egg white, which, when added to a drink and shaken, turns foamy, pretty much the same way an egg white turns into meringue when whisked. The final touch comes from adding soda water at the end, which, just like a soda fountain drink, makes the bubbles rise even higher. Because it contains cream, the Ramos Gin Fizz, is really an indulgent boozy soda fountain drink. It’s delicious, but it’s next-level cocktail-shaking and I prefer to steer clear of dairy in the hot summer months, so I thought it best to use a different Fizz for this column. There are plenty of options, since the family includes at least a dozen different recipes. Some people even include the Mojito and Tom Collins in the family. I have a soft spot for the Silver Gin Fizz—gin, lemon, egg white, sugar and soda water. For this 100-mile version of the recipe, we’ve tweaked this classic slightly by using lime instead of lemon and Beattie’s Farm Crafted Potato Gin ($39.95; LCBO 645622), which is distilled from potatoes in Alliston, Ontario. It’s a neat distillery, since they use the odd-sized potatoes (chip industry rejects) to make vodka and gin, so it’s part of the zero-waste movement, too.  Alliston Fizz 2 oz Beattie’s Gin 1 oz lime juice 1 egg white 2 teaspoons special fine granulated sugar 1 tiny pinch of salt 2 oz soda water Add ice, gin, juice, salt, sugar and egg white to a cocktail shaker and shake rigorously for 60 seconds—until the shaker is ice-cold. Strain into a tall glass with four or five ice cubes. Slowly pour soda water to make it froth up. PRO TIP: Many bartenders keep a small bottle of saline solution at their stations and add a couple of drops to a range of cocktails, including the Fizz. It’s used for the same reason it is in baking, namely, that it helps bring out flavour. A lot of cocktail technique is actually pretty similar to baking, such as the use of egg whites or specific grades of sugar. Cocktail recipes may seem finnicky but, details are important. Special fine granulated sugar, for example, is much easier to dissolve in the cold shaking process than the normal granulated sugar you stir into your coffee. "

It’s worth noting that they weren’t in the pink for long. It was only last summer, really, when we saw everyone, from behemoths like Beefeater to local craft producers like Willibald Farm Distillery, launch a pink gin. This year, judging from the new gins at the LCBO, well, orange is the new pink. Life moves at you pretty fast in the liquor world. From my point of view, this is a good turn of events. The pink-gin craze was largely inspired by the phenomenal success of Empress 1908, a blue gin from Victoria, B.C., that turns pink when you add tonic or citrus. This colour-changing trick is the result of butterfly pea flower but, other than that additive, it was still a proper gin. Many of the pink gins that followed in its footsteps, however, also had a lot of added flavour and sugar. Some had as much as 70 grams of sugar per litre, which verges on being a gin liqueur, as opposed to a spirit. Unlike the pinks, most of the orange gins have little to no added sugar. And, having tasted all the ones I can find at the LCBO, I can say that they’re all also pretty delicious. Not all are orange (sometimes it’s just the bottle), and that’s just fine with me. What follows is a little roundup, from blood orange to Valencia oranges, with a little explainer on how to best enjoy them, since there’s a surprisingly wide range of flavour profiles involved. Most people know blood oranges for their colour first and flavour second, but with the hue-free and aromatic Whitley Neill Blood Orange Gin ($44.95; LCBO 14754), it’s all about the taste. It’s got a bold, candied-orange peel flavour, but with none of the candy sweetness, making it pretty easy to pair with ginger ale or tonic. Our favourite way, by far, to drink this is to turn it into a Blood Orange Negroni — equal parts Campari, sweet vermouth and this gin, stirred and strained into a glass filled with ice. No garnish required.  Since Tanqueray Flor de Sevilla ($30.95; LCBO 573956) is the sweetest of the six at the LCBO, the best way to serve this is to keep it simple — on the rocks with a spritz of soda. One of the nicest things about this light-coloured gin is that you can still taste the juniper through the delicate Seville-orange flavour, so you don’t want to drown it with mix. Two parts gin, one part soda and a wedge of lemon is all it needs. If it weren’t for the fact that this is a full-strength spirit, Beefeater Blood Orange ($30.45; LCBO 15765) could pass for a punchy Italian aperitivo such as Aperol. It’s brightly coloured and has flavour to spare, so it will hold its own in a champagne cocktail like a modified French 75 — one ounce this gin and four ounces cava or other sparkly wine. Of course, gin and bubbly wine is a powerfully dangerous combo, so, if you want to tone it down a little, it’s also delicious with Lemon Tonic — one part spirit, three parts tonic. Made with Sicilian oranges, Malfy Gin con Arancia ($39.70; LCBO 10715) is dry and lively with a complex blend of bitter and spicy notes — frankly delicious. You could stir this over ice and turn it into a lovely Martini with a twist of lemon to fully appreciate its sophisticated flavour profile, or pair it with a straightforward tonic water, such as Fever-Tree Mediterranean. They call the region south of Barcelona the “orange blossom coast” for its ample sweet-orange groves, which provide the inspiration for Botica Valencian Orange Gin ($42.45; LCBO 12668), an international collaboration between folks in Spain and the Netherlands. It’s gin first, orange second, which is also just fine with us — especially mixed with grapefruit and soda water (two parts gin, two parts fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, one part soda).  You can’t really call Hendrick’s Midsummer Solstice ($59.70; LCBO 12564) an “orange gin” per se, since this colour-free botanical-forward gin also showcases fresh berry and floral flavours, but there’s a distinct orange-peel finish that we think qualifies it for inclusion. Like all Hendrick’s products, this is a crowd-pleaser, that becomes even more of an easy-drinking refresher when you add a little Elderflower Tonic. Also makes a great Martini."

Especially lately, since the drink has gone from a dusty old curiosity to a “call drink” — cocktails that aren’t necessarily on the menu, but get ordered by customers anyway. A couple of years ago, bartenders reported that the Old Fashioned was overtaking the vodka soda as the top call drink on King West.  So, if the Old Fashioned is so great, why did it need to stage a comeback? Well, for decades, the original cocktail lost its way as the Fruit Old Fashioned gained popularity. An Old Fashioned is basically just sweetened, slightly bittered, diluted whisky served over ice and garnished with an orange peel, but at some point people decided to take it up a notch by muddling fruit into the drink. That, in itself, wasn’t such a terrible idea. Unfortunately, one of the “fruits” involved was the maraschino cherry. I once saw a bartender take a scoop of bright red Day-Glo cherries and toss them in the bottom of a glass, along with a few slices of orange, smash them up, then add ice, simple syrup and whisky. It was … not good. Fortunately, as more and more bartenders started researching bygone recipes, a more minimalist Old Fashioned was revived. It became especially popular once people realized that it was more than a recipe, but rather a method that could be applied to just about any spirit. Once you master the basics, you can make it with rum, brandy, tequila or even gin. Here, though, we are making it with Canadian whisky, since that’s a delicious spirit — and barrels of it are being made within 100 miles, right here in southern Ontario. Old Fashioned 2 oz Canadian whisky 1 sugar cube 5 dashes Angostura bitters 1 oz soda water Orange peel (1 inch by 2 inches) Method: Place the sugar cube in an Old Fashioned lowball glass. Douse the sugar in bitters, add soda and start muddling until the sugar is dissolved. Add whisky and a couple of large ice cubes and stir for 30 seconds. Express the oils from the orange peel and serve. Or drink.  Tip: Bartenders pay a lot of attention to ice for a simple reason — rate of dilution. Spirit-forward drinks are generally served on one or two large cubes that don’t melt as quickly, since oversized ice keeps the drink from becoming watered down. Jumbo ice-cube trays can be bought at cocktail supply shops like Toronto’s Cocktail Emporium. "

Here, its founder, Chantal Carter, speaks about getting her business off the ground, the hardships she faced along the way and how to maintain the current momentum to support Black-owned businesses.  How did you get the idea to start Love & Nudes?  “I became an entrepreneur because I worked as a wardrobe stylist. ‘Nude’ [underwear] was always something a model needed, and I wanted to enjoy, too, but the big problem was that ‘nude’ was always defined as beige, like a pink tone, and it was only for white skin. So, when the Black models or women of colour would come in for a photo shoot, they wouldn’t have nude undergarments; you kind of had to make do, maybe with black or be naked, but the white models had that. I always thought it was an issue. If you had something that matched your skin colour that would mean that you could wear white or something sheer without your undergarments showing through. My pet peeve was when I wanted to wear lace and I wanted it to look like it was my skin underneath the lace, I couldn’t achieve that. If I wanted a nude bra I had to paint one. I bought a white bra and a white panty and I hand-painted it my skin tone and I didn’t care that it was crusty, hard and uncomfortable. I just wanted the look and I said, ‘We’ve got to do better than this. This can’t be it.’ So, that’s how the idea turned in my head.” What did people tell you when you first came up with this idea and said I’m going to make bras that match every skin tone? “I did research with women on the street, in the mall and I questioned them on what ‘nude’ meant to them, and a lot of the women of colour that I spoke to said, ‘Nude is our own skin tone colour,’ but I found a lot of them identified nude as peachy, beige, rose, even if they were Black or another woman of colour, and I was like, ‘Wow, it’s so enforced, it’s so systemic.’ It never occurred to them that it could be outside of that and that it could be their skin tone, too. Nude has been defined as beige in fashion, in all products, for years. When I was pitching to an investor, I wanted to come out with four different skin tone colours that represented all the skin tones of the world, and he told me that it would be too many colours, for a retailer to carry. I remember how shocked I was. In that moment I was told that I didn’t matter. I wasn’t valid. I was like ‘Why? There’s purple bras, there’s red bras, why is having different skin tone colours an issue?’ I shook it off and kept going, but you keep those little digs. Somebody said there’s an emotional tax when you don’t see things that look like you or you are not validated or acknowledged in everyday life. There’s an emotional tax for that that you have to navigate through, and I really feel it’s important to make that change.” It’s the same in the beauty industry “Same thing with makeup, yes. The Black models and Indian models would come with their own foundation because they couldn’t trust that the makeup artist would have a colour that matched their skin, so yeah, it’s heavy.” So, you empower women when you give them products that are meant for them “That’s what it is. I’m not just a lingerie company or a bra and panty company. It’s about the intimates as a vessel for self-love, acknowledgment and feeling inspired and empowered. You can get up and put on the foundation of your wardrobe every day and it looks like you. You don’t have to think about what to wear, you just put on a bra and panty that matches you and you can go about your day to deal with the everyday difficulties. That helps so much. It’s a good start.” In the U.S. last year the State of New York passed a law where you can’t discriminate based on hair features that would basically apply to Black women. What’s your take on that? “Oh yeah, we feel like it has to be straightened for it to be acceptable and it’s not true. This is where systemic racism, again, comes in. It’s the people who have the positions who don’t look like us dictating what we should look like, and we internalize that. I remember when I stopped straightening my hair and I let it grow naturally, I was going for a job interview years ago and my husband said, ‘Are you going to go like that?’ I was like, ‘This is who I am. I’m not going to put on a wig.’ I was just done with trying to sneak in the back door to be accepted to get the job. If they don’t like me because of my hair, then I don’t belong there. That must change. When there are diverse workforces there are different perspectives, different voices behind the scenes. Then those kinds of rules and regulations are not going to be put out because there’s going to be other voices there that can fight that or say, ‘That’s not accurate, that’s not right.’” What would be your advice for young women who have a business idea? “Well, this was in my head for years before I actually did anything about it. I think what delayed me from getting started is I never said anything to anybody. So my advice would be to speak to the right people, somebody that you trust, because I was in this fear-scarcity mentality that somebody was going to steal my idea, or they’re going to think it’s stupid, or I’m going to be judged, and I think that delayed me from doing anything. Then I reached out to another woman founder who had an underwear line at the time for advice and that was really helpful for me. When you speak to somebody you get another idea or it can lead you somewhere else, or you find new information that you never thought of, so it’s really important to share your ideas, but to the right people.” Love & Nudes is an all-women team with an ethical supply chain. How does that work? “I was so fortunate to find a women-led facility in South America, and we have the same philosophy about supporting our communities. Our bra and panty makers are single mothers being paid fair wages. That was really important for me. I felt like how can I talk about inspiring and empowering other women while not paying people? I didn’t want to go to another country where there was child labour involved or people were being abused because I know what that feels like, as a black woman and as a woman of colour. So yes, my products will cost a little bit more, but it’s because it’s helping to support a community as well. I find when we put women first, the world is a much better place and there’s a chance for things to actually change and improve, so that’s my contribution.” There has been an outpouring of support for black-owned businesses in Canada now. What does this mean to you and how do you hope it translates into long-term values for Love & Nudes? “Well, the last month or so has been really great for brand awareness and to help increase sales for my business. I did a story with CBC and I said, ‘We’re not a trend. This is our lives; this is our livelihood that we want to build.’ I’m really hoping that the support continues, and if people want to end systemic racism, it’s really important for all of us — Black people, white people — to support black businesses to close the economic gap between Blacks and whites and other cultures. We need to continue having these conversations to ensure that it does, no matter how awkward it is. I always say, ‘Without awkwardness or discomfort, there’s no growth.’ If you want to be comfortable all day long, nothing is going to happen. I hope the support continues, and I can get the capital I need to help grow my business along with other Black businesses. We are pop culture. Everything is influenced by us, yet we’re not behind the scenes in fashion and a lot of other industries. Clearly, we have amazing ideas, we have amazing influence, we have a lot of swagger.” [laughs] We’ve had to make something out of nothing forever, so you can imagine what we can do when we do get the support that we need, so we too can grow into billion-dollar companies and give back to the community. Everything starts with families and communities. You need to be economically stable to be able to build families and strong communities. We’re more beautiful all together, not separate.”"

After three days seated at my dining room table, watching what was effectively Quibi for fashion — which is to say, the first streamed digital couture “shows,” forced online by the coronavirus pandemic and transformed into bite-size nuggets that ranged from ersatz music videos to schmaltzy short films and previews for collections to come — I’m starting to wonder. Yes, everyone gets to watch what was formerly an entirely exclusive, just-for-insiders, demonstration of fabulousness. That’s a good thing. But honestly, give me the runway. I never thought I would write those words. Like many, I have complained about the waste involved in fashion weeks: all those people flying around the world to sit twiddling their thumbs waiting for a show to start while ogling the celebrities across the catwalk, most of whom are dressed in full-blown evening clothes at 10 a.m., surrounded by elaborate sets made to be demolished after 20 minutes, all in the service of (in the case of the July shows) a parade of insanely expensive handmade clothes for the very few. Nero, meet your fiddle and all that. But what this whole digital experiment ultimately revealed is that, though music and movies have been using fashion to their own ends for decades now, reversing the equation doesn’t really work. Not even when you rope in a famous film director, as Dior did with Matteo Garrone, the Italian auteur behind “Pinocchio” and “Dogman.” And give him carte blanche to make … a mash-up of myths involving mermaids, Narcissus, satyrs, bellboys and nymphs who really, really, want to wear lamé goddess gowns and wafting, feathered coats instead of barely there bits of chiffon. Not even when you team up with a cult-y musician, like Olivier Theyskens did with Sylvie Kreusch of Warhaus, for his debut at Azzaro couture, all rhinestone siren slinkiness balanced on a knife-edge just this side of kitsch. Not even when you get a famous actress, as Iris van Herpen did with Carice van Houten, formerly the Red Priestess on “Game of Thrones,” and have her animate a single look that plays with your sense of perception in odd angles and cuts, so it seems to grow around her body like a nimbus of rebirth. Not even when you dress up well-known models and convince them to do awkward dancing, as if they were punk princesses at the famous Parisian disco Le Palace, while wearing bejeweled bouclé and lavishly flounced taffeta, as Chanel did. It feels inauthentic: a copy of an idea from another creative discipline. And the problems of couture are not so much financial (most of the brands that can afford couture have enough of a cash cushion to survive the current situation and someone, somewhere, is still buying it) as existential. With the dire state of the world, what’s the point? There’s an electricity to a live event, with its sense of shared experience and risk, that answers that question and cannot be replicated in the vacuum of the internet. There’s a specificity to a fashion show, a rhythm in the entrances and exits and struts, a duet between body and cloth, that has its own cadence and offers its own implicit thesis about the costumes IRL, which loses its force when it gets moved to an URL. It’s too easy to look away. To roll your eyes. And giggle. Well, now we know. And it’s not actually a judgment on the clothes themselves, anyway. It’s a judgment on the context. When is a show not really a show? In any case, thinking of these digital shows as shows is probably wrong in the first place. They were more like a joint declaration of belief: We’re still here! (That’s why, even though it didn’t have an actual show, Maison Margiela offered up a 48-second lava lamp of a show trailer, starring the vamping model Leon Dame suggesting the form of a longer … something … to be a revealed July 16. Ditto Valentino, which clocked in at just over a minute with its hypnotically morphing single piece of fabric/promo for a July 21 show. They wanted to show their faith in the official couture organization, even though their main events are later.) After all, fashion, like so many industries, is in crisis as a result of the coronavirus pandemic: stores shuttered, fabric mills closed, brands declaring bankruptcy. To dare, in the face of a lockdown that separated designers from their ateliers, to create any form of a collection for public consumption is a kind of triumph: an aria of optimism into the void, a testament to imagination and ingenuity. And in fact, the videos that revealed just that — bringing the viewer inside the creation process — were the ones that hinted at couture’s true magic. Ironically, it’s the documentaries that may actually best convey the “dream” that is couture: the handwork and humanity woven into its seams. So while Dior’s movie was misguided escapism (verging on the objectionable, thanks to an entirely white cast, which is the dream of exactly who these days?), its opening scenes, which took place in the ateliers, were irresistible. They showcased the fact that the collection — the gold Aphrodite dress with its flowing cape, the sunburst-shirred high-collar white shirt and a pale-pink halter-neck ball gown covered in beaded branches — had actually been created in miniature, scaled down to 40 per cent of a traditional toile to create a treasure chest of a collection that will later travel the world for clients to ogle and order (full-size, of course). Designer Maria Grazia Chiuri had been inspired by Le Théâtre de la Mode, a travelling exhibition of 150 dolls created in 1945 by designers of the day such as Lucien Lelong, Schiaparelli and Jeanne Lanvin as a way to revive couture in a post-Second World War world and rescue the fashion industry from economic ruin and emotional despair. You can understand it: what worked once, might well work again. Especially when close-ups of the 2020 versions revealed the careful artistry of the petites mains (little hands) that made them, the camera watching an artisan painstakingly using a tiny needle to create the fringing on the hemline of the moonlit gown. Just as it was charming, if not entirely satisfying, to look over the shoulder of Daniel Roseberry of Schiaparelli as he sat sketching away on his “imaginary collection” in Washington Square Park, near the New York apartment where he was sheltering in place, drawing tape measure straps, power shoulders and zeppelin-size balloon sleeves (for looks that will be made later this year). And to have sneak peeks from Ulyana Sergeenko and Elie Saab at the hands transforming basic materials into extraordinary embroidery for their somewhat overblown creations. Even if all the soft focus nature that followed mostly called to mind a perfume commercial. Up close and at home They all made me long for more such intimate experiences: not just to goggle at the flotillas of tulle and cloqué of Giambattista Valli, with their exclamation points of bows both large and small (look: a swan! and look: a white taffeta bow as big as a torso atop a white chiffon dress as tiny as Joan Smalls’ waist!) but to understand how they are constructed. Though to be fair, at least with his video, you could see the clothes instead of just the mood. To really understand the Chanel collection, for example, which ultimately looked a whole lot better than designer Virginie Viard’s recent stabs at half-hearted casual couture, you had to eschew the live action for the static lookbook: 30 styles versus the short’s five, including some lavishly restrained midnight blue gowns and not-quite-understated armorial tweed jackets. In any case, only Viktor & Rolf managed to capture the absurdity of the whole exercise: us, sitting in our rooms around the world, staring into small screens by ourselves, mesmerized (or not) by well-intentioned efforts to elicit asynchronous rapture. They did it with a five-minute play in three acts titled “change” (small c, all in gold balloons) that spliced the classic department store show with today’s working-from-home ethos, with a stentorian voice-over by the singer Mika and a heavy dose of levity. See, for example, an empire-waist sapphire satin negligee spotted with lace storm clouds to reflect “a feeling of sadness and anger familiar to many these days.” Or the pale pink chemises adorned with “contradictory emoji,” the “frantically entangled” sashes swirling around enormous bathrobe coats, and the enveloping A-line silhouettes to guarantee “you will remain in your own safe zone while venturing out into the world.” There was a lot more like that. “If only we could change ourselves as easily as we do our outfits,” said Mika. That is, of course, the promise of all this; the beauty is that we all keep hoping. It just seems so much more convincing from the ballroom chairs."

And they make a lot of scents,['Mark & Ben CullenGreen Spaces'],"Tue., July 14, 2020","Winston Churchill, the legendary British prime minister, had a way with words. In a 1959 letter to John Weall, the founder of our former company — Weall and Cullen Nurseries — Churchill wrote: “Gardens, trees, bushes and flowers all have their legends woven with trysting place, love blowers, moon drenched meadows, romantic woods, with birds and bees attendant.” His romantic thoughts were likely inspired by the aroma of a flower. After all, romance easily rises in the evening air thick with old-fashioned night-scented stock, nicotiana and heliotrope. We’re now at mid-summer and the flowers in your garden are competing with each other for the attention of pollinators. That’s the real reason why Mother Nature infused many garden variety flowering plants with a sweet scent.  You may have your own reasons for bringing some scent home. Do lilacs remind you of your grandma’s garden? Is phlox a friend from your childhood?  Now is the perfect time to reach into your memories, and create some new ones, by stirring your sense of smell with aromatic plants and flowers. Here are our favourite perennials that are flowering right now — and each heavy with sweet scent. You’ll find these at many garden retailers this time of year. Phlox (Phlox paniculata). The flowers produced by phlox are outstanding by any standard. Sometimes the blooms are so big, they can be mistaken for hydrangea. Butterflies and hummingbirds love them too. They grow to about 70 centimetres and are hardy to zone 4 (Ottawa/Montreal). Bee balm (Monarda). This magnet for many insect pollinators is growing in popularity. It is a native plant, blooms up to six weeks through to early fall, is hardy to zone 4, and, like other native plants, it is insect and disease resistant. When we see aphids on our monarda, we just blow them off with a stiff stream of water from the end of the hose. Bee balm will spread, since it’s a member of the mint family, but not as aggressively. Daylily (Hemerocallis) Fragrant Returns. There are very few daylilies that are truly fragrant — but this one is. Look for it by name. Grows to 50 cm in full to partial sun. It’s very winter-hardy, good to zone 3 (Winnipeg and Regina) and blooms from early summer to mid-fall. Daylilies are among the easiest perennials to grow and after a few years you can dig them up, divide them and move the divisions around your garden. Delphiniums (Delphinium). All delphiniums are fragrant, beautiful and rebloom when you cut them this time of year. They grow to a height of one-to-two metres, depending on the variety and are a favourite mid-summer wedding flower. They tend to grow well for three or four years then disappear and many gardeners have blamed themselves for the demise of their delphiniums. This is a waste of guilt. We recommend that you plant new ones every three years. Problem solved. Hosta ‘Fragrant Bouquet’ (yellow-green leaves), ‘Aphrodite’ (white flowers), ‘Guacamole’ (light-green foliage, white flowers). Like daylilies, hosta flowers are not generally very fragrant — but these varieties are.  You can cut the flowers to enjoy indoors and all hostas produce flowers that attract hummingbirds. Hardy to zone 3 (Winnipeg/Regina). They do best in part-sun to shade.  Russian Sage (Perovskia atriplicifolia). Every sunny garden, with a few square metres to spare, should have at least one Russian sage plant. Their purple blossoms last up to eight weeks, mature at about a metre high and are hardy to zone 4. They tolerate periods of drought and heat, attract butterflies and hummingbirds and you guessed it, they are fragrant. What is not to like?  If you enjoy flowers’ fragrance, don’t let the scents go to waste: Place the plants near a sitting area where you can enjoy the wonderful smell wafting over you in the calm morning air or when romance stirs in the evening."

Then Ottawa offered hope,['Alex BoutilierOttawa Bureau'],"Tue., July 14, 2020","OTTAWA—Like charitable organizations across Canada, WE Charity was hit hard by COVID-19. Morale within the organization had been low for weeks, with long-time staff members being shown the door as the global health crisis deepened. Then news started circulating within the organization of a significant federal government contract. The Liberal government’s $19.5-million deal for WE to operate a $900 million student volunteering grant program turned the mood around, a source within the organization told the Star. “It was a really demoralized space for quite a while, and then we started hearing whispers internally about a government contract, a government project,” the source said. The Star agreed not to name the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. A second source corroborated their account. “They started presenting it internally before the documents were ever signed, the contract was ever finalized, because that’s the way WE works. So we started drawing up the program before it was assured, before it was guaranteed. We started hiring people back based on that.” The mood within the organization is markedly different today, the source said, now that the international charity finds itself at the centre of a political scandal. Over the past week, it has been revealed WE paid members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s family to speak at WE-hosted events. Margaret Trudeau, the prime minister’s mother, received $250,000 in honorariums for speaking at 28 WE-hosted events between 2016 and 2020. Alexandre Trudeau, the prime minister’s brother, received $32,000 in speaking fees between 2017 and 2018. Then it was revealed that Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s daughter works with the organization. On Monday, Trudeau and Morneau apologized for taking part in the cabinet discussions around the awarding of the contract. The federal ethics commissioner has launched an investigation. WE laid off 450 contract workers after the federal deal was nixed. Those workers were let go after the scandal broke and the charity and the government “mutually” agreed to let the public service administer the $900-million program to pay students to volunteer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The source said WE Charity and its co-founders, brothers Marc and Craig Kielburger, are now in damage-control mode.  The charity took out full-page ads in the Star and the Globe and Mail Monday, in which the Kielburgers apologized for the scandal. The same advertisement ran in Postmedia papers Tuesday. “The charity’s integrity and purpose has been called into question,” the advertisement read. “It has had direct impacts on our staff, supporters and beneficiaries. We have made mistakes that we sincerely regret. It has led us to more closely examine our own internal structures, governance and organization.” The charity issued a statement to the Star in response to questions about the organization. “With respect to our staff’s morale, WE Charity has welcomed 2,500 current and former staff over 25 years, and we respect the voice of each individual,” the statement said.  “We strive to create an environment for all employees where they can enjoy coming to work each day.” WE is by no means alone; charitable organizations across Canada have seen a decrease in donations and revenues since the pandemic hit. According to Imagine Canada, an advocacy group for the charitable sector, 73 per cent of Canadian charities reported donations were down in May 2020. “The size and scope of (COVID-19-related) shifts is beyond anything that we have seen before, far exceeding what we saw in the 2008/2009 financial downturn,” wrote David Lasby, the organization’s director of research, in a May report. “(It’s had) broad effects (so that) even the most diversified revenue bases are seriously affected.” The Star’s source said that the Kielburgers began regular town hall meetings within the organization after the news website Canadaland in late 2018 began to investigate the charity, in an effort to increase transparency for its employees.  A frequent aspect of those internal pep talks was a financial update from Marc Kielburger. The source said that last fall, Kielburger started talking about a coming recession and the “smart moves” the charity was taking to make sure it wasn’t overextended. And then COVID happened. “It is true that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the Canadian charitable sector as a whole, and WE Charity was no exception — but to be clear, WE Charity had no risk of ceasing operations,” the emailed statement said. “Prior to WE receiving its contact, the government had recognized the challenging times for the sector, and allocated $350 million through partners including the United Way, the Red Cross and Community Foundations Canada. The contract with WE was a further step in working with charities who were co-ordinating placements for students, while also engaging post-secondary students in meaningful service. That is the sole reason we participated.” There is considerable anger within the organization’s 174-person workforce, and especially among those contract workers laid off after the scandal hit, according to people who spoke to the Star on the condition they not be named. The government contract allowed WE to rehire a number of employees the organization had laid off since the pandemic hit. One source described it as “keeping the lights on” for WE’s programming.  The Prime Minister’s Office did not immediately answer a request for comment Tuesday. "

The survey, conducted by Campaign Research for the Star, found that just 13 per cent of those polled thought tuition should remain the same. “I think everybody is looking for a bit of a discount,” said Campaign Research principal Nick Kouvalis. It’s partly a reflection of how people feel about online learning, he said, and “if people think they are not going to get the full experience” of being on campus, spending thousands on tuition doesn’t sit well. A number of student groups have also been pushing for a break on tuition for this fall. Campaign Research polled 1,434 people across Ontario last week, using the Maru Blue opt-in online panel. The equivalent margin of error for a random sample of the same size is plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The survey found the public is split on universities offering in-person classes this fall, with just over one-third supporting the move and 31 per cent opposing it. The remaining third were unsure. However, if classes were smaller, some 67 per cent of respondents feel it would be safe for students to be learning on campus. But when it comes to living on campus, just 27 per cent of those surveyed said it is safe to reopen residences, with 39 per cent saying it’s not. However, if universities only allow for one student per room, 55 per cent agree residences could safely operate this fall. About 50 per cent of respondents felt January 2021 to the best time to reopen residences. Some Ontario colleges and universities are planning for online-only learning this fall, with others promising a hybrid of remote and in-class sessions where possible. Some have closed residences or are planning for one to two students per room depending on the size of the space. Last month, the province announced a summer pilot project allowing post-secondary institutions to partially open their campuses to allow “academically stranded” students to complete lessons or labs they missed during the COVID-19 shutdown. Schools across the province — including all 24 public colleges — are taking part in the pilot, targeted at students studying health care, nursing or the trades, which call for practical, hands-on experience to graduate. Colleges and Universities Minister Ross Romano said the pilot will help guide schools as they plan to reopen safely this fall."

Health Minister Christine Elliott said there were 111 new cases reported Tuesday morning, with one death. “Locally, 28 of Ontario’s 34 public health units are reporting five or fewer cases, with fully 21 of them reporting no new cases at all,” Elliott said on Twitter. “With 122 more resolved, there are 11 fewer active cases in the province.” There are 137 patients in hospital with COVID-19 with 39 in intensive care units. Of those, 21 are on ventilators. Most of Ontario — excluding the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and parts of the southwest — will enter the third stage Friday, meaning restaurants and bars can serve meals indoors and gyms can reopen as long as physical distancing is maintained. Queen’s Park says 2,723 people have died from the virus since the pandemic struck in March, but the Star has determined there have been 2,761 coronavirus deaths in Ontario. That difference of 38 fatalities is because some were not included were not included early in the outbreak since COVID-19 tests had not been conducted before those people — most of whom were elderly residents of long-term-care homes — died. The government says there have been 36,950 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario. As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, a Star survey of Ontario’s regional health units found a total of 38,966 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19. Over the last week, the province’s 34 health units have reported an average of 127 new infections per day — well down from a sustained peak of nearly 600 cases per day, seen in late April. Tuesday’s 5 p.m. total, up 91 cases in 24 hours, did not include any new reports from Toronto, which has switched to updating just three days a week. The Star’s tally includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, which means they have symptoms, travel history or contacts that indicate they likely have the disease, but haven’t yet received a positive test from a lab."

Energy Minister Greg Rickford on Tuesday announced Susanna Zagar, a long-time bureaucrat, as the new chief executive officer of the OEB. Lynne Anderson, who was appointed to the board by the previous Liberal government in 2017, will be the OEB’s new chief commissioner. “I look forward to working together with these experienced leaders as we renew and modernize the OEB,” Rickford said in a statement. “Strong leadership will help the OEB better serve individuals and families, allow the provincial regulator to operate more effectively and efficiently, and help ensure that Ontario’s energy system remains sustainable and reliable, as was envisioned in the OEB review panel,” he said. In the wake of the Tories’ cronyism scandal last summer — when Premier Doug Ford’s then chief of staff resigned suddenly amid a furor over patronage postings — the government has moved to make appointments less partisan. The province says reforms at the OEB are aimed at “enhancing transparency and accountability” and “pursuing greater efficiencies” by “reducing regulatory burden.” Zagar, a former senior civil servant at Queen’s Park, has most recently been chief strategy officer at the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board. Also being appointed to the OEB are: John Knubley, a former federal deputy minister; business owner Gerald Moncrief; former media CEO Glenn O’Farrell; energy expert Marie Oswald; and business consultant Allison Duff."

In an interview with the Star on Tuesday, Ford was asked if his province-wide summer tour is to set the stage for a snap vote this fall. “No, not at all,” the premier said from Waterloo. “We’re going to year four.” That means the June 2022 election will go ahead as planned. While the province has a law on the books that fixes election dates at once every four years, the Progressive Conservatives could easily amend the legislation because they have a majority in the house. Opposition party strategists have privately worried Ford might opt to face voters earlier in order to get out ahead of the post-pandemic economic hardships that loom. “You might not want to be an incumbent premier or prime minister going to the polls in two years’ time if we’re in a deep recession,” said one senior Liberal insider, speaking on background in order to freely discuss strategy. “So we’ve told our team to get ready for any eventuality,” said the Grit, noting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s minority Liberal government is gearing up for a possible federal election. But Ford, who will spend the next eight weeks visiting 38 of Ontario’s 124 ridings in seven regions of the province, insisted his blitz is not a pre-election victory lap. “There’s no victory at all,” he said, emphasizing the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than 2,700 Ontarians and left the province in a state of emergency since March 17 is far from over. The premier launched his tour Tuesday at Cambridge’s Eclipse Automation, a company that retooled its machines to manufacture N95 and surgical masks and other medical supplies. He said he just wants to thank businesses “for stepping up” during the outbreak. “We’ve all been cooped at home in the bubble for too long. It’s a big province,” said Ford, who was also at Challenger Motor Freight before heading to Kitchener’s Shaver Industries, which is making 25,000 face shields a week for front-line workers. On Thursday, Ford will visit Essex County, where he’ll get his shaggy golden mullet trimmed by a local barber. “You wouldn’t believe how many barbers there are down there,” he enthused. Freshly coiffed, he plans to be back in Waterloo Region the following day. Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca expressed concern about the premier hitting the hustings. “Parents working from home are struggling with child care and Doug Ford is nowhere to be found,” said Del Duca. “His priorities are way out of order — he has a detailed plan to reopen pubs and movie theatres, but none to get our kids back in school this fall,” he said. “Doug Ford should spend his summer figuring out the crisis in our schools, not campaigning for re-election.” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said Ford is displaying “poor judgment.” “Shame on him for worrying about his election chances as opposed to worrying about the things that everybody else are still worrying about,” said Horwath. “Things like businesses being able to weather the storm with a government that didn’t really help out at all, in terms of direct support. Everybody’s worried about [going] back to school and Ford decides he’s going to go campaigning? Really, really, really troubling,” she said. “It’s extremely disappointing that that’s what Mr. Ford thinks his job is — to seal his next election, as opposed to to continue to be here to deal with the crisis that’s unfolding still with COVID-19.” Green Leader Mike Schreiner charged that Ford is campaigning at the same time as his government is “failing to deliver for parents, students and teachers, a plan to safely reopen schools this fall.”  Ford’s barnstorming, which is designed to boost the Conservatives’ political fortunes, come as he has seen a rebound in public-opinion polls for the Star. The premier had a -49 per cent approval rating this time last year, when he was loudly booed at the Toronto Raptors’ victory celebrations at Nathan Phillips Square while Trudeau and Mayor John Tory were cheered. Last July, a poll found that just 20 per cent of respondents approved of the job he was doing while 69 per cent disapproved and 11 per cent had no opinion. But the latest Campaign Research poll for the Star found Ford now has an overall 39 per cent approval, a swing of 88 percentage points. The firm found 66 per cent approved of his performance with 27 disapproving and six per cent having no opinion.  Campaign Research polled 1,395 people across Ontario last Wednesday and Thursday using Maru Blue’s online panel. It is an opt-in poll, but for comparison purposes, a random sample of this size would have a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20. On Friday, much of the province will enter the third stage of reopening, meaning restaurants and bars can serve indoors and outdoor playgrounds will reopen. However, the GTA and Hamilton area will remain in the second stage for at least another week. Ford said has no regrets about moving slowly, noting American officials have “been reckless down there” by reopening the economy too quickly."

It’s not just Americans or Canadians who were shaking their heads over the injustice of it all. In Beijing’s leadership compound, and in Huawei’s halls of power, they likely had a similar reaction last week. And a pointed question: Why should Canada’s earnest claims about the impartiality and integrity of the justice system — not ours, but America’s — be taken seriously by China, or us, if Trump now treats it as a joke? Which raises another question: If many Americans no longer have faith in their own system, and China clearly doesn’t, why are we putting the Canadian justice system — and the lives of our fellow citizens — on the line? When the Mounties arrested Huawei’s Meng Wenzhou in transit at Vancouver airport at America’s request, China responded by ransoming the “two Michaels” — diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor — on trumped-up charges. While Canada saw only injustice at the trading in human lives, Trump jumped at the opportunity for horse-trading — musing publicly about a quid pro quo where he would drop the case against Meng if China acquiesced to a trade deal on favourable terms. Washington later walked back Trump’s incriminating talk. But in the months since, the U.S. has never gone beyond mere finger-wagging over China’s actions. Between offering to release Meng and announcing the release of Stone, the president has dropped any pretense of legality in the justice system over which he presides. In so doing, he has only deepened China’s political conviction that a judicial conviction in Trump’s America is a matter of political expediency, not impartiality — with Canada acting as an accessory. Canada has limited leverage with China, but we are not without options — in both Beijing and Washington. With extradition cases, Canada’s justice minister has the legal right to intrude or upend it at anytime, though this has never been done for blatantly political reasons (notably foreign bullying), lest our justice system be held hostage again in future. But we must also admit that the administration of justice has already been brought into disrepute by this case, which is utterly unlike any other. It involves a powerful defendant and two superpowers jockeying for position in a bipolar world while Canada — a mere middle power — tries to triangulate on behalf of two powerless Canadians. Watching our citizens interrogated in harsh conditions while Meng lives in the lap of luxury — bankrolling a private security force to satisfy her bail conditions regarding the risk of flight — offends our sense of justice. Quite apart from the asymmetry between Meng and “the two Michaels,” she enjoys privileges not afforded to — or affordable for — ordinary Canadians lacking her money and means. In light of those inequities, Ottawa could convey to the Chinese that it will instruct Justice Department lawyers to challenge Meng’s bail conditions on the grounds of security (never mind reciprocity). The crown could cite the case of former Renault boss Carlos Ghosn — who overcame strict bail conditions in Japan to flee to his native Lebanon — arguing that it has given Canada cause to reconsider (that it might give China pause to recalibrate can be left unspoken). Would a judge agree? If China remains convinced that our judiciary abides by political agendas, perhaps a quiet signal that we are considering such a move could serve as a perfectly justifiable — and just — thought experiment. We must admit, however, that a middle power like Canada has limited leverage with the Chinese. The same cannot be said of the Americans, who are both powerful and vulnerable. Ottawa would be well within its rights to give the Americans an ultimatum quietly at first, publicly if necessary, framed as a choice for them to make — leaving the ball very much in their court (if not a court of law): Canada must now consider Meng’s release, due not to Chinese actions but American inaction. That Trump mused last year about releasing Meng for a trade deal — imperilling the “two Michaels” by signalling that Canada was in cahoots on a contrived case — was itself indefensible. What’s truly unconscionable, however, is that the president has said almost nothing consequential since then about China’s pressure tactics. Imagine for a moment that an American diplomat were arrested in China in retaliation over the Meng case: Trump and Congress would be taking dramatic measures, escalating until China chose to de-escalate. It would surely impose painful sanctions against China — as it has on Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, and others with whom it has grievances, rightly or wrongly. Beyond empty words — few and far between — what has Washington done to make China pay for its transgressions against Canada as we act as America’s jailer? If China’s rulers can violate international norms with impunity, while an American president flouts his own judicial system with alacrity, what — and whose — rule of law is Canada upholding? Why take the heat for the Trump administration if it is unwilling to generate heat on our behalf? Time for Ottawa to send signals to both Beijing and Washington: The Chinese and Americans cannot fight their grudge match to the last Canadian."

That may or may not be enough to persuade the public to forgive him for not recusing himself from the controversial file. But even if it’s not, the $50-billion commitment could go a long way toward giving companies a lifeline as they emerge from the pandemic – as long as it’s designed strategically as well as quickly. The move was foreshadowed last week in Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s fiscal update and has been weeks in negotiation, so let’s not be too cynical about the motivation behind the multi-billion-dollar announcement that Trudeau blurted out within seconds of apologizing for his involvement in the WE fiasco. But there are no details available yet for how the subsidy will work, and for that, we can be plenty cynical. Trudeau had just one sentence about it in his morning news conference, and Morneau’s office would only say — with a smiley face attached — that details were not ready yet, It’s that kind of vague policy announcement that got the prime minister in trouble with the WE file to begin with — a headline designed to fill a political need, with the fine print to come sometime “soon,” once the officials can catch up with the politics of the day. The fine print is important here, for economics and politics alike. Morneau and Trudeau have pinned their hopes for an economic restart on the wage subsidy. In theory, when provincial governments relax their COVID-19 rules, as Ontario’s Doug Ford did on Monday, the wage subsidy will kick in and help companies stay above water when they reopen just half way. Ford said some regions of the province can now open up restaurants, bars and daycares, but not necessarily at full capacity because physical distancing rules remain in place. The hope is that the federal wage subsidy will shoulder a large part of the payroll of any company that is still losing a big chunk of its revenue compared to last year, allowing firms to reopen and bring back their workers even if they’re still constrained due to pandemic rules. But how much of their payrolls will be covered by this extension? How much money does a company have to be losing in order to qualify? And what about companies that are hoping to hire back minimum-wage workers, but can’t find any because they’re collecting the more lucrative Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)? Without those answers, companies won’t know if it’s worth their time and effort to reopen on Friday as the premier hopes, says Perrin Beatty, the president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “We need to get that information as soon as possible,” Beatty said. “It’s critical for tens of thousands of businesses, particularly in some sectors” such as tourism, travel, accommodation, retail and restaurants. When it was first introduced, the wage subsidy was available to companies that could show a 30 per cent drop in revenues compared to last year. But that agreement expired at the end of June, and now, government officials and business leaders alike say the 30 per cent cut-off is too harsh — there’s no incentive for a company hovering near the threshold to make an extra dollar if it might lose its payroll support as a result. Similarly, there’s a growing understanding within government that the CERB had its place in sustaining family finances during the dark days of the lockdown, but now it needs to be wound down and replaced as employers reopen so people will be encouraged to go back to work. These are complex policy questions that officials and experts have been hammering away at with increasing urgency, but that the prime minister — in his haste to have some good news in the face of scandal — rolled out before his civil service had the required paperwork in hand. That’s partly why he ended up in hot water with WE Charity. In late April, as the opposition NDP roared about the lack of financial help for students and threatened to withhold its support for COVID-19 aid without measures, Trudeau unveiled a generous $9-billion student aid package.  Along with commitments to create more summer jobs and extend emergency benefits to students was the creation of the Canada Student Service Grant — the program now swirling at the centre of the WE controversy. It’s now clear that the plan to pay students up to $5,000 for volunteer work was not nearly ready for prime time. After winding its way through cabinet approvals, it finally saw the light of day more than two months later, only to spark an immediate controversy. While the Liberals are paying a political price for that backwards process, students continue to go without their promised support. The wage subsidy talks are well advanced, but the economic stakes of getting the design just right are high. Let’s hope Trudeau didn’t speak too soon again."

The Campaign Research survey, conducted for the Star, also found that 71 per cent of respondents think educators should be mandated to use livestreaming if online learning continues, with the highest level of support in the Halton and Peel Regions. “The public is nervous, but feeling safe” with the government’s slow reopening during the pandemic, said Campaign Research principal Nick Kouvalis. However, he added, people are “still wary about full-on school ... but that could change in a month. If we get down to 50 cases a day, then people might change their mind.”  The poll comes as school boards and the provincial government face pressure to safely open up schools full-time to help working parents — especially women — return to or remain in the workforce as restrictions are eased during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The province has told boards to make plans for three scenarios — online only, in-class or a mix of the two. Campaign Research polled 1,434 people across Ontario last week, using the Maru Blue opt-in online panel. The equivalent margin of error for a random sample of this size is plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20. Among those surveyed, some 51 per cent supported the hybrid model, 18 per cent preferred in-class and 11 per cent supported online only. About 20 per cent did not have an opinion. As for online learning following the March shutdown of schools, almost 20 per cent said kids’ experience was excellent or good, with 26 per cent characterizing it as fair or poor. Some 55 per cent were unsure. But just 20 per cent of respondents said the quality of education during the extended shutdown was excellent or good, with 45 per cent calling it fair, or poor. Just over one-third did not have an opinion. At the legislature on Monday, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said “people can’t go back to work unless their kids are back in school and back in child care. While the premier spent last week ignoring pleas from parents frustrated by the lack of plans for September, school boards across the province spent their last week scrambling to try to put a school year together and calling on the premier to reverse his decision to send kids back to school part-time this fall.” She also said without an overarching plan, there will be a patchwork of different models and kids should have access to “quality public education that’s pretty equal around the province.” Premier Doug Ford said with “the best advice that we have from the chief medical officers right across this province we decided to let each school board make a decision, and we gave them three different criteria that they can work with.” Trustees in Toronto have raised concerns that kids need to be in class full time, and have urged the province to come up with creative solutions — such as finding extra space so schools can have more, smaller classes to accommodate as many students as possible. Boards had asked the province for local flexibility for this fall, Ford said, and “what I’m hearing from parents is that it’s a good plan. What I’m hearing from school board trustees is, ‘Thank you for giving us the option, rather than forcing options down our back.’” Ford added that “every jurisdiction is a little different and what applies up in Kenora doesn’t necessarily apply in Hamilton or in Toronto.”"

Why won't he explain how it happened?,['Susan DelacourtNational Columnist'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","Justin Trudeau made a bold bid to break up with the ethics controversy consuming his government on Monday with a new twist on an old classic: “It’s not WE. It’s me.”  There was nothing vague about the prime minister’s apology for how he and WE Charity have become tangled in an ethics storm over pandemic relief. In fact, Trudeau approached near-mathematical precision on Monday with his very personal regrets for what he had failed to do in the whole mess.  “The mistake we made was on me and I take responsibility for it,” he said. Trudeau said he was sorry he didn’t excuse himself from cabinet discussions about WE Charity, and also sorry he didn’t know more about the extent to which his family was involved with it.  What his apology didn’t cover was how this ended up in front of his cabinet in the first place, and the absence of red flags for him or his government — the crucial “what were you thinking” question that hangs over the entire story.  So while Trudeau’s words on Monday may have slightly cooled the ethics uproar that’s erupted in the midst of this pandemic, they won’t make it go away.  Significantly, his apology also offered no assurances for the future, and that’s important — this being his third brush with ethics investigations in his career as prime minister.  What has he learned about why this failed to set off ethical alarms from the outset? Monday’s me-not-WE apology didn’t quite cover that.  Trudeau’s regrets, for now, are intensely personal — maybe intentionally so. A larger, more expansive apology may not come until after the ethics commissioner’s inquiry.  It’s worth looking closely at how precise the prime minister was when he laid out on Monday where he’d gone wrong with WE and the proposal to have the charity handle nearly $1 billion in pandemic relief for students.  Trudeau did not say he was sorry about the idea, which he again said came from the public service, only that he didn’t officially bow out of the discussions about it.  “I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions, given our family’s history. I am sincerely sorry about not having done that,” Trudeau said, going on to cite all the ways the government had been working with other charities on pandemic relief. “But when it came to this organization and this program, the involvement I’d had in the past and my family has should have had me remove myself from those discussions.”  Note: Trudeau is not saying that the proposal shouldn’t have come to cabinet, only that he shouldn’t have been there. The prime minister also didn’t mention Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who has been found to have his own family conflicts with WE, including a daughter employed by the charity. It was left to Morneau to issue his own personal apology later in the day, in a separate statement, which followed the same general lines as those of his boss: not a bad idea, just unfortunately handled at cabinet.  Significantly, the finance minister hasn’t even ruled out the prospect of WE being the subject of cabinet discussions in future. “I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE,” Morneau’s statement said.  The most sincere, genuine part of Trudeau’s apology came when he was talking about how all of this has affected his mother, who has been very public — including at WE events — about her lifelong battles with mental illness.  “Obviously I knew she worked with WE,” Trudeau said. “I didn’t know the details of how much she was getting paid by various organizations but I should have and I deeply regret that. What I also deeply regret is the fact that I have brought my mother into this situation in a way that is really unfair to her.” Margaret Trudeau’s involvement with WE was definitely obvious. She and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau were together in London at a WE event in March, which is where the prime minister’s wife was believed to have contracted the COVID-19 virus that put the PM into isolation early in the pandemic.  Long before WE was picked as the favoured charity to hand out aid to students during the pandemic, in other words, it had already played a role that was a little too close to home.  Trudeau may be saving the larger, more expansive explanations for his discussions with the ethics commissioner, who will most certainly want to know more than just why the prime minister failed to absent himself from cabinet discussions about WE Charity. “It’s not WE, it’s me,” may work as a break in the heat of this controversy, but those won’t be the last words in this fraught relationship.

Premier Doug Ford said most of Ontario would enter stage three of the framework for reopening on Friday as new coronavirus cases remain low, but the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and parts of the southwest have to wait a week. “We need just a little more time,” Ford said Monday. Indoor restaurants, bars, gyms, cinemas and outdoor playgrounds can open in Ottawa, Brant County, Peterborough, Grey Bruce, Kingston, Kitchener-Waterloo, Guelph, Muskoka, Sudbury, North Bay and a slew of other regions. Toronto, Peel, Durham, Halton, York, Hamilton, Niagara, Haldimand-Norfolk, Windsor-Essex and Lambton will remain in the current second stage of reopening. Ford suggested those regions could open up as early as July 24, so long as new cases of coronavirus stay steadily low and Dr. David Williams, the province’s chief medical officer of health, gives him the green light. That’s the same day Ontario’s state of emergency, in place since March 17, is due expire after yet another extension was granted Monday by MPPs. Education Minister Stephen Lecce said as of July 27, all child-care centres across Ontario can open with up to 15 kids per room. Lecce said that should enable them to be at 90 per cent capacity, meaning more parents can get back to work. He added schools could also reopen for students in September, although that situation remains fluid. “We will be cautious, methodical and focused on safety to get this right, because keeping your child safe is what matters most,” he said. “I’ll be sharing more details soon about the return to school plan, which I know is top of mind for many parents around the province. We are confident in this plan to enable parents to return to work while having the peace of mind that their children are cared for.” Green Leader Mike Schreiner questioned the Progressive Conservative government’s strategy. “Securing a safe place for kids to be Monday to Friday should be a higher priority than allowing people to crowd into bars and restaurants,” said Schreiner. “We are still without a sound plan for education or new funding for child-care providers to implement COVID-19 safety protocols.” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the Tories need to offer more help for small businesses struggling in the pandemic, like subsidies for Plexiglas barriers and personal protective equipment for workers. “As we prepare to move into a new stage of our economic reopening, we must remember that small businesses across the province are struggling because Doug Ford didn’t provide the kind of direct support needed to keep Main Street healthy and vibrant,” said Horwath. The premier insisted Ontario has learned lessons from the U.S., where reopening businesses and attractions too quickly has led to a surge in cases. “I see these numbers from Florida and they’re staggering — 15,000 people that contracted COVID in a day, that is scary. But we’re being pretty vigilant. We aren’t rushing into anything,” said Ford.  After Friday, the places in stage three can have indoor gatherings of up to 50 people, while in stage two the limit remains at 10. Outdoor gatherings will be increased to a maximum of 100 people in the third stage. However, some restrictions will remain. Amusement parks and water parks will not be allowed to open. Nor will buffet restaurants, night clubs, overnight camps for children, private karaoke rooms, saunas, bath houses, oxygen bars or table games at casinos. In bars, there will be no dancing and all patrons will need to remain seated inside. For athletes, “prolonged or deliberate contact while playing sports is not permitted” in order to curb the spread of COVID-19. Spectators at such events must abide by the gathering limits and physical distancing restrictions. While gyms, fitness studios and community centres can reopen indoor facilities, similar measures will be in effect to keep people two metres apart. Concerts, artistic events, theatrical productions, performances and movie theatres can resume with limits. “Performers must maintain physical distancing of two metres from every other person, except from other performers where necessary for purposes of the performance,” the government said. Similarly, “audiences are subject to the number of people that can maintain physical distancing of at least two metres and cannot exceed gathering limits of 50 indoors and 100 outdoors,” it said. “This applies to the entire facility, regardless of the number of theatres or performance stages within the facility.” Ford said amusements parks and multiplex cinemas could make a pitch for exemptions to the rules. “If they come up with a plan, a proper plan that keeps people’s social distanced and in other areas and puts it forward to the chief medical officer and they approve it, then they can open,” he said."

Health Minister Christine Elliott said Monday that 29 of the province’s 34 public health units reported five or fewer cases, with 21 of them reporting no new cases at all. “Having seen a continued decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases as the province entered stage two, and with hospitalizations being at all-time lows, today we’re providing details about stage three of our plan to continue the safe and gradual reopening the province,” Elliott said on Twitter. There are 104 patients in Ontario hospitals with coronavirus, 28 of whom are in intensive care units. Of those, 20 are on ventilators. That encouraging data is why Premier Doug Ford unveiled the next steps of opening up the economy with much of the province to reopen Friday, though the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area will have to wait until at least late next week. Ontario has been in a state of emergency since March 17, meaning the government has had sweeping authority to close businesses and restrict the opening of public spaces. Most of the province will enter the third stage later this week, meaning restaurants and bars can serve meals indoors and gyms can reopen as long as safe physical distancing is maintained. The provincial government says 2,710 people have died from the virus since the pandemic struck in March, but the Star has determined there have been 2,759 COVID-19 deaths in Ontario. That difference of 49 fatalities is because early in the outbreak, some were not included since COVID-19 tests had not been conducted before the people — elderly residents of long-term-care homes — died. The government says there have been 36,839 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario. The government says there have been 36,839 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario.

He's right. It is. At one level, throne speeches are always vague. They set out the broad direction where the government — in this case Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's minority Liberal government — intends to go. They avoid detail. In that sense, Thursday's throne speech was classic. It summarized most of the Liberal election campaign promises that the government intends to proceed with, ranging from measures to combat climate change to gun control. But governments also use specific words to mean specific things. And pharmacare is one area where language is crucial. That's because the term pharmacare covers a lot of ground. To some, it means filling in the gaps — that is, providing drug insurance to the minority of Canadians who lack it. That's the version that Finance Minister Bill Morneau, in a burst of honesty, once said he favoured. It is also the preferred option of Andrew Scheer's Conservatives. To others, however, pharmacare it is a more ambitious idea, akin to medicare. Like medicare, it would be universal — that is, it would cover all Canadians, thus obviating the need for private or workplace-supplied drug insurance. Like medicare, it would be comprehensive and cover all necessary pharmaceuticals. Like medicare, it would be accessible — available to rich and poor alike on the basis of need. Like medicare, it would be portable, meaning that it would cover Canadians outside their home provinces. And like medicare, it would be publicly funded through tax revenue. It was this more ambitious version that an advisory panel, chaired by former Ontario health minister Eric Hoskins, recommended to the Trudeau government earlier this year. But Thursday's throne speech contains none of the language associated with the ambitious version. All it says is that the government ""will take steps to introduce and implement national pharmacare.""  What does ""national pharmacare"" mean? The throne speech doesn't say. But as Singh pointed out, there is no mention of universality or public funding. Nor is there any reference to the Hoskins report that the government itself commissioned. That Singh was able to find fault in the throne speech is politically convenient for the New Democrats. They need to stake out ground to the left of Trudeau's Liberals without triggering a costly snap election. In this case, they can do so. Bloc Québécois MPs have said that they will support the throne speech, thus giving the minority Liberal government enough votes to withstand any challenge in the Commons regardless of what the NDP does. Once serious debate on pharmacare begins, however, the New Democrats will have to square their support for universal, public drug insurance with their position on Quebec. That position, first articulated in the party's 2005 Sherbrooke Declaration and reaffirmed 10 years later, is that Quebec should be allowed to opt out of any new, federally funded social programs, such as universal pharmacare, but keep the money. It was designed to appeal to Quebec voters and, for a while, succeeded. But it could play havoc with Canada's ability to develop new national social programs. If Quebec is granted the right to opt out with compensation, the other nine provinces will demand the same treatment. The premiers have long made that clear. Still, kudos to Singh for pointing out the contradictions in the Liberal approach to pharmacare. If he could only sort out his own party's contradictions, we might be able to get somewhere.

Justin Trudeau did just that last week. He  donned his Teflon suit once again. The prime minister staggered to the new year, exposed as committing a serious ethics violation, shielding a finance minister who was trying to dig out of his own hole, taking it on the chin about unrequited trade. Or so it seemed in the so-called Ottawa bubble, the snow globe I called home for many years. Maybe only the bubble denizens thought the prime minister was a little lost. So, as he hit the halfway point in a cross-country town hall tour late last week, Trudeau reminded those who pack these events that it's ""easy to get sucked into the Ottawa-centric"" bubble around Parliament. He calls these town halls a grounding exercise. More accurately, it is an exercise in getting out of Dodge to rebuild your image. This is how Trudeau was elected prime minister. He was out meeting voters before the 2015 writ was issued rather than standing in the corner of the Commons firing questions to a government on message track. The fact is, Trudeau is not a stellar performer in the Commons. But he is good in the town hall format, and he should receive much credit for ensuring questions were not vetted - unlike the slick, partisan events put on by Stephen Harper as Mike Duffy lobbed him softballs - and dealing easily with hecklers. But at last  week's session at McMaster University, no one asked him about the holiday with the Aga Khan, though he was asked a day earlier in Nova Scotia.  No one asked him why his MPs voted against him appearing before the parliamentary ethics committee.  No one asked him about trade with China, or the future of NAFTA.  No one asked him about Finance Minister Bill Morneau's foibles or insults from Minister of Persons with Disabilities Kent Hehr. No one was allowed to ask a followup. And, unlike the daily question period, Trudeau could take as long as he wanted in response, rhapsodizing about diversity and equality and freedom of speech as long as he wished. It is his show, his sweet spot, and it must gall the opposition that he is still treated like a celebrity in those settings. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer would likely only get a viral clip from a town hall if he fell off the stage. That doesn't mean there weren't perceptive questions for Trudeau. One man asked him why, as a champion of Indigenous reconciliation, he did not acknowledge the traditional territories of Hamilton (Haudenosaunee and Mohawk). Another asked how Trudeau could protect Canadians from returned ISIS fighters when he didn't even take proper security precautions for his Hamilton event. But even in an event that promises spontaneity, there are rules. Make sure to have a lot of diverse faces behind you for the cameras. Take a breather every now and again. Call on the guy sporting the Liberal button and invite the Grade 5 student to ask a question. Charming, but a nice break. He was asked if he believed in freedom of speech and what his legacy might be. It beats having questions shouted at him in a media scrum. Trudeau, like all successful politicians, shines when handling hecklers. Brian Mulroney often fought his way past angry demonstrators to enter an event, responding with a smile and his baritone, ""Ah, I'll put you down as undecided."" NDP leader Jagmeet Singh received international attention and praise by preaching love and tolerance to a racist heckler right in his face. An alternative approach? Jean Chr�tien famously delivered the ""Shawinigan handshake"" to a protester at a Flag Day event, grabbing him by the neck. It worked for Chr�tien. Trudeau won a standing ovation in dealing with a heckler's diatribe about the Omar Khadr payout, and it won him this front-page headline in the Hamilton Spectator: ""Prime Minister is a chip off the old Trudeaumania."" So far, the Teflon suit fits well. But there is a reason we vote for men and women and place them in that bubble. They must be accountable to Parliament, and they should be required to take questions from parliamentarians on their misconduct. Trudeau can revel in his town hall love, but he should have sat and taken questions from Ottawa's ethics committee. And when Parliament returns, he won't be fielding any questions about his legacy. "

The prime minister should be careful what he asks for. The much-discussed but still theoretical Canada-China free trade pact has been undergoing a kind of perils-of-Pauline adventure this week. It seemed alive and well Sunday when the prime minister landed in Beijing, reportedly to announce with his Chinese counterpart that formal negotiations on the deal were ready to begin. By Monday it seemed at grave risk, as it became clear that a significant snag existed, which precluded such an announcement. By Tuesday, the hint of a deal was in the air again following news that Trudeau was leaving his international trade minister, Francois-Philippe Champagne, in China to keep on talking. China and Canada have held preliminary discussions for roughly a year. Simply put, that means they have been trying to figure out whether they have enough in common to bother engaging in real talks. China wants tariff-free access to Canada for its exports and the freedom for its companies, many of which are state-owned, to invest where they will. Canada wants reciprocal privileges but it also wants more. Trudeau's Liberal government wants what it calls a comprehensive and progressive deal that would cover a wide range of economic activities. Specifically, as the prime minister noted this week, it wants a deal that would include gender, labour and environmental rights. But I suspect that Canada's wish list is quite a bit longer and involves areas that go beyond mere trade, such as intellectual property, dispute settlement mechanisms and regulatory harmonization. All of these are part and parcel of the newest generation of trade deals, including the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union. Government officials routinely cite that pact as a model. But do Canadians really want a comprehensive economic agreement with powerful yet low-wage China? In some cases, the answer would be an unqualified yes. As Australia has discovered, China is a master at using technical regulations to block agricultural imports that, under a 2015 trade deal between the two countries, are supposed to enter freely. Presumably, in any Canada-China deal, Ottawa would try to curb Beijing's use of these so-called nontariff barriers. But Canadians might be less amenable if China insisted on challenging our health and safety or immigration regulations in the name of free trade. In Australia's case, China insisted that its firms operating in Australia be allowed to import temporary Chinese workers. This almost cost the deal its bipartisan parliamentary support — until a compromise was reached whereby any Chinese temporary workers brought in were assured of Australian wage rates. Australia's experience highlights the difficulties of melding high-wage and low-wage countries in a single free trade pact. The Trudeau Liberals argue that they can finesse this by including a labour rights chapter in any deal. But would the Chinese dictatorship of President Xi Jinping seriously countenance, say, independent trade unions? It doesn't tolerate any other power centre that might threaten the ruling Communist Party's monopoly of control. Comprehensive trade and investment deals are difficult enough when the signatories are of equal weight. They become more difficult when, as in the case of the North American Free Trade Agreement, one partner (Mexico) follows a deliberate low-wage policy. They can become impossibly tricky if that low-wage partner is also the dominant player in the relationship. So raise a glass to the idea of modest goals. It took 10 years for China and Australia to hammer out their relatively primitive free trade deal. Canada and China have been at it for only one. Trade with China is almost certainly a good idea. It's already happening without a formal deal. But a comprehensive economic relationship? Maybe not."

The question comes to mind again following former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn's decision to plead guilty to charges of lying to the FBI about his conversations in late 2016 with Russia's then ambassador to Washington. So far, most reportage has concentrated on the effect this will have on U.S. President Donald Trump, But I'm stuck on a prior question: Why did Flynn feel it necessary to lie in the first place? What was wrong with someone sure to be a key member of the new administration talking to an important foreign ambassador? Specifically, what was wrong with Flynn's asking Russia not to escalate a round of tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions? Technically, Flynn could have been charged under an obscure 1799 law aimed at preventing private citizens from discussing matters of state with foreign entities. But it's a law that, for obvious reasons, has never been used. I expect Flynn wouldn't have bothered lying to the FBI about conversations with, say, the Canadian ambassador on matters of mutual interest. But, in this climate, talking to the Russians was simply one step too far. The ostensible reason is the widely held belief that Russian hackers working under Putin's orders undermined the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The unspoken corollary is that Putin is responsible for Trump's victory. The reigning conspiracy theory is that Trump and/or his minions colluded with Putin to bring this about. All of this is possible. Sometimes there are conspiracies. The simpler explanation, however, is that Trump won because his brand of right-wing populism worked particularly well in the complicated U.S. electoral college system and because his opponent, Hillary Clinton, ran a terrible campaign. But the conspiracy theory fits the popular Western notion of Putin as evil genius. I'm not sure why this notion holds. It is true that Russian elections are stacked. But as longtime political operative Donna Brazile has pointed out in a recent book, so is the U.S. Democratic Party's nomination process. At least the Russians do have elections, a nicety that the Saudis, say, don't bother with. Putin is justly criticized for unilaterally annexing Crimea to Russia. Yet no Western government berates China for its unilateral annexation of Tibet in 1950. Beijing's argument that Tibet is historically part of China is accepted. Putin's argument that Crimea is historically part of Russia is not. Indeed, the West's kid-glove treatment of Chinese President Xi Jinping stands in stark contrast to the way it approaches Putin. Xi is not routinely denounced as an undemocratic autocrat, although he is one. Canada, for instance, has imposed economic sanctions against figures around Putin for their gross violation of human rights. It has done nothing against Chinese rights violators close to Xi. Some of the reasons for this double standard are economic. China is the world's second-largest economy. Western business people want a piece of the action. To that end, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's trip to China thus week is focused on trade and investment. Don't expect sunny Trudeau to dwell on downers such as Xi's human rights record. Other reasons for the double standard are geopolitical. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the West became accustomed to a diminished Russia. To see it reasserting itself today in its traditional spheres of influence — Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Baltic states, Central Asia — is disconcerting. China is also reasserting itself, particularly in the South China Sea. But that has given rise to little popular alarm in the West. Which brings me back to Michael Flynn and America's current fascination with the Russian threat. The notion of Trump as Putin's malleable tool has the eerily familiar ring of Cold War paranoia. And it is equally improbable."

The bar and the NDP leadership hopeful both have rich musical histories, so before he sits down for a bite, he has to bound over to say hi to the bartender, himself a member of a well-known band. Of course. Angus, an old rocker, is in the final days of his longest tour of all. It's the waning days of the party's leadership race, one that has been fought well below the national radar, but one that has major ramifications for Canadian politics. For Angus to win, he must motivate the party's longtime members, many of whom he admits had let their memberships lapse, had drifted and were still bruised by a spirit-breaking 2015 campaign defeat. He is believed to have most of that support, but they have to be enthusiastic enough to vote when balloting begins Sept. 18. He must beat back an insurgent campaign from Ontario MPP Jagmeet Singh, the late campaign momentum of Quebec MP Guy Caron, who Tuesday picked up the endorsement of former party president Brian Topp, and the hard-left movement being built by Manitoba MP Niki Ashton. Angus is working to return the NDP to the days of Jack Layton, when members had a stake in decisions and felt valued, before the days when they were impersonally hit up for cash and told what the party's message was. The party under Tom Mulcair had become rigid, hidebound, overly bureaucratic and afraid to take risks or make mistakes. It was the antithesis of bold. The Orange wave became the beige puddle. It's been a tough road for Angus. He's had to campaign with the weight of his sister's death this summer. He's had to endure sniping that he is too old, that politics, particularly leadership politics, are for the younger. Angus is 54, nine years older than Justin Trudeau, 16 years older than Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and Singh. ""Andrew Scheer acts a lot older than me,'' he laughs. ""I am a generation younger than (Bernie) Sanders or (Jeremy) Corbyn.'' His ability to bring the party back in Quebec is rightly questioned, although he would likely make Caron a deputy leader and Quebec lieutenant. Singh says he has signed up 47,000 of the almost 124,000 eligible voters, including 30,000 in Ontario. Angus believes those numbers are bogus, part of a Singh bluff and bluster effort to win on the first ballot. Singh has not backed down from his tally. But Angus won't reveal his own membership numbers. Many Singh supporters will be seen as instant New Democrats and their commitment to the party beyond their candidate will be questioned. But this is the bottom line in this leadership race. If Singh gets his people out to vote, Angus's efforts to build bridges to second or third ballot support may not matter. As leader he would target the Liberal government for walking away from promises. He lists a ""cynical"" walk away from electoral reform. Not so much the policy, but more a prime minister blatantly breaking his word. On Indigenous reconciliation, he says Trudeau has been all talk and symbols. Angus is rightly appalled at the sight of Liberal ministers going to court to fight a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision aimed at helping Indigenous children. He sees an Indigenous justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, fighting residential school survivors in court. He sees a brutally inefficient Indigenous Affairs bureaucracy that can't deliver services while children die and continues to try to erase Indigenous identity. He would create an independent child's ombudsman who could act so kids aren't dying because somebody's request for help is sitting on a desk somewhere. He believes the Liberal government has also failed on the environment after its grand promises at the Paris environmental summit. He would legislate the limits on greenhouse gas emissions, but remains somewhat vague on the West Coast Kinder Morgan pipeline which has pitted the Alberta NDP government of Rachel Notley against the British Columbia NDP government of John Horgan. He says he is concerned about the safety of the pipeline expansion and he does not believe it has garnered the ""social license"" needed for the project but he wants to move beyond pipeline debates and talk about a new energy industry in this country. Angus has the chops for the job and could reinvigorate the party from the bottom up. But only if the party looks away from the flash of the Singh insurgency."

Well, you'd want to start your day promoting a book by a Milwaukee county sheriff who has called Black Lives Matter a hate group, is a known racial profiler and, naturally, is a big Donald Trump supporter. The book foreword was written, of course, by your best bud forever in the media, Sean Hannity. Then you would turn your attention to tropical storm Harvey, congratulating yourself on how you saved so many lives — a victory lap even as the water kept rising in Houston and area — but you wouldn't want to dwell on that, so you would move on to your 2016 electoral success in Missouri, take a shot at the crime rate in Mexico and again vow that it will somehow pay for a border wall, then move on to trade negotiations. ""We are in the NAFTA (worst trade deal ever made) renegotiation process with Mexico & Canada. Both being very difficult, may have to terminate?"" Uh-oh. Trump's thumbs are now typing ""Canada"" on Sunday mornings. Last week, in an infamous stream-of-consciousness meltdown in Phoenix, he said the same thing, telling supporters he would probably end up ""terminating the deal at some point,"" because ""we have been so badly taken advantage of."" One can get permanently lost down a rabbit hole trying to make sense of the various tweets and pronouncements from Trump, but the shout-out to Sheriff David Clarke, Trump's coming rally in Missouri, his ongoing fantasy about a Mexican-financed wall and his continued threats to tear up NAFTA actually do have a common thread. They are all campaign preoccupations from a man who has never stopped campaigning and who never really became president. The Trump tweet is the cyber-equivalent of the boss walking past the negotiating room banging on a frying pan with a hammer and squeezing an air horn. But it is nothing more than that. This is no Art of the Deal. This is the Rant of the Attention-Seeker. It's not about us. It's all about him. Texans, at least those not scrambling atop their homes to save their lives, may want to be reminded that almost 50 per cent of their exports go to their top two trading partners, Mexico and Canada, and they import about 42 per cent of their goods from their NAFTA partners. While you're trying to stay above rising flood waters, it's good to know your president is musing about ripping up a trade deal so vital to your state. At least a couple of Canadian politicians couldn't help themselves Sunday. ""The only thing that needs to be terminated is your presidency,"" Hamilton Mayor Fred Eisenberger wrote. ""Save yourself and your country. Resign and you will be popular everywhere."" NDP leadership candidate Charlie Angus was somewhat more poetic: ""A poor player struts/frets his hour on the stage and then is heard no more. A tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing."" He moderated his comments later in the day, pushing the government to keep its eye on the ball. That's what it's doing. Adam Austen, a spokesperson for Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, is becoming quite practised at tossing out the political equivalent of Xanax. ""We will work with our partners at all levels in the United States to promote Canada-U.S. trade, which supports millions of jobs across the continent,"" he said. ""As we have said before, trade negotiations often have moments of heated rhetoric. Our priorities remain the same, and we will continue to work hard to modernize NAFTA, supporting millions of middle-class jobs."" Even if Trump did, in a fit of pique, seek to terminate NAFTA, it's not certain he could do it. Congress, not Trump, is ultimately responsible for giving a thumbs-up or thumbs-down to any renegotiated deal. There is also legislation on the books that enshrines NAFTA and there could be enough pro-trade, had-enough-of-Trump Republicans to decide the 24-year-old legislation overrides any presidential attempt to kick the pact into the ditch. All three countries have agreed to fast-track talks, but the first negotiating session has just ended and the second, in Mexico, doesn't begin until Friday. They have to ignore the bully in the corridor banging on his campaign-era frying pan. If you're Canadian and Trump thinks we're being ""difficult,"" there's only one sane reaction: Good. And pack a pair of noise-cancelling headphones."

Minister says she’s still looking for answers,"[""Rob FergusonQueen's Park Bureau""]","Fri., April 17, 2020","It’s unclear why measures aimed at putting an “iron ring” around nursing homes failed to stop COVID-19 from causing “tragic” levels of death and illness, says Long-Term-Care Minister Merrilee Fullerton. The admission came as the province revealed three-quarters of the new coronavirus fatalities officially reported Thursday in Ontario were of vulnerable nursing-home residents.  At least 933 have tested positive for COVID-19, along with 530 nursing-home staff to date, the highest toll of any workers in the health-care sector.  The measures to protect nursing homes include screening of new admissions, staff and volunteers and stiff restrictions on visitors.  But on Thursday the province added more measures. They include the temporary ban on transfers of hospital patients to long-term care unless in extraordinary circumstances, and only with a COVID-19 test followed by 14 days in isolation with droplet and contact precautions. Nursing-home residents in the same room as a patient with symptoms will now be tested, as will all residents in adjacent rooms, all staff on the unit or nursing-care hub involved, any essential visitors and other contacts as deemed necessary. Wider surveillance testing will also be conducted in select nursing homes to get a wider picture of disease.  Fullerton, a former family doctor, called the highly contagious virus different from the expected influenza pandemic and said improved testing and the freeze on hospitals transferring patients to long-term care will help limit the damage. The goal is “to understand how elusive this COVID-19 is and what else we can do, what other tools we have for this,” she added, acknowledging some nursing homes were scrambling for staff even before the illness hit. “It’s a new virus with a new way of spreading,” Fullerton told reporters, saying the way it is shared by people who are not showing symptoms has made it difficult to manage.  Statistics on outbreaks in more than 100 of the province’s 626 nursing homes became increasingly grim Thursday, further evidence of what Premier Doug Ford has famously dubbed a “wildfire.” More than half, or 271, of the 514 new coronavirus cases reported by the Ministry of Health were in nursing-home residents who accounted for 29 of the 38 new deaths.  That’s the “first time” COVID-19 infections in nursing homes have outpaced new infections in the community, said chief medical officer of health Dr. David Williams. The provincial numbers are based on reports from Ontario’s public health units as of 4 p.m. the previous day. The numbers indicate COVID-19 cases in nursing homes grew at a rate of 12 per cent in 24 hours, double the rate in the general population. Across Canada, almost half of deaths from the illness are in long-term-care residents and 93 per cent of fatalities are in those over age 60.  Officially, Ontario has reported 162 deaths of nursing-home residents but a more up-to-date Star compilation of reports and news releases from public health units puts the number closer to 250. Critics said the province should have put as much effort into preparing nursing homes for the onslaught as it did getting hospitals ready for a surge of patients that has not yet materialized.  “It should never have come to this,” said NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, urging Ford to detail a plan to take over direct management of nursing homes with severe outbreaks, as has happened in British Columbia. “Families deserve answers as to why their mothers and fathers were not better protected,” added Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca, calling for a public inquiry. Acting on a promise made by Ford earlier this week, Fullerton said teams from several Toronto hospitals including Mount Sinai and North York General have been sent to 38 area nursing homes to determine what help they need with patient care, infection prevention and control, testing and personal protective equipment. The ministry would not reveal the names of the nursing homes.  “This is the model that we will be expanding across the province.”"

The Waterloo athlete achieved her dream of playing professional soccer this past season when she landed a gig with FF USV Jena, a club on Germany’s top women’s circuit. “It was a very eye-opening experience,” said the Bluevale Collegiate Institute graduate. “It was cool to see something that was my passion become my profession.” But Karn only got a taste of the top level. An injury sustained in training limited her to just three games. When she was nearing a return, the COVID-19 pandemic hit. “My whole season was a little bit chaotic,” she said. “It wasn’t the first professional season that I wanted to have but it motivated me even more to have a better season this year.” And that will likely be on a different team, after Jena was relegated to the second division in Germany. Karn’s agent is currently scouring top women’s leagues abroad to find her next job. Once travelling restrictions ease up, she expects to head overseas to resume her kicking career. “I’m hoping to stay in the first division in whatever country I go to,” she said. “That’s the goal.” And Karn is used to achieving her goals. Besides playing soccer, she’s also a professional dancer after honing her craft at studios in Kitchener (Bojangles Dance Arts) and Bolton (Joanne Chapman School Of Dance). She starred in her first music video alongside pop star Shawn Desman when she was just 14 and has danced in TV shows and the Much Music Video Awards, among other things. When she wasn’t dancing, she was using her fancy footwork on the soccer field as a standout at Wilfrid Laurier University and the semi-pro Kitchener-Waterloo United FC. Through it all, Karn got a degree in kinesiology from Laurier and a master’s degree in human health and nutritional sciences from the University of Guelph. She also waits tables at Vita Lounge and Bistro, Kitchener’s new Italian hot-spot. And she’s only 24. “I’m someone that is productive when I’m busy,” she said. Soccer has always been a big part of the Karn household. Dad Dennis played in his younger days and the clan’s German roots meant the black, red and gold flag was waved when the World Cup was on TV. So, playing in her ancestral home was a huge honour. Getting there took some work. It started with Karn landing a training stint with Bristol City in England’s top women’s league for two summers while at Laurier. From there, she went to Frankfurt for more practise. A coach from that squad ended up running Jena and offered her a job last July. “I want people to know that if you put your mind to it and put in enough work, regardless of what you want to do, it’s possible,” said Karn, who credits her dad, mom, Shelley, and sister, Tanya, for helping her achieve her soccer dream. “I want to motivate girls from Canada and Waterloo Region so that they know it’s actually possible.” One day, Karn wants to crack the national women’s soccer squad. For now, she continues to train locally with a former Laurier teammate, workout from home and tend tables while waiting for the call to her next stop in soccer."

The Waterloo native, a six-foot-seven middle blocker and occasional right-side hitter with the Kitchener Waterloo Predators Volleyball Club, has been awarded a roster spot for virtual training sessions with Canada’s Under-19 men’s team. The program, according to a news release, aims to further connect, educate and continue the development of select athletes as Canada looks ahead to world championship qualification in 2021. Thirty players will take part in the U19 virtual camp and Schoenherr, a three-time Team Ontario selection, is one of 11 players to hail from this province and the only one from Waterloo Region. The soon-to-be Grade 12 student at Bluevale Collegiate has mixed feelings about his initial foray into Team Canada territory.  “It’s obviously not what I was expecting for my first national team experience but it’s pretty surreal to be up there with the top athletes in a country that is sending a team to the Olympics next year,” said the 17-year-old Schoenherr. “Unfortunately, the (U19) team was supposed to be going to Colorado and then Honduras, but that’s not going to happen because of COVID. It might eventually happen, maybe they’ll push it back a year, I really don’t know.” The virtual camp runs Monday through Friday of next week and participants will attend two sessions daily. After a weeklong break, the camp resumes July 27 for another week of a two-a-day video gatherings. The fact Schoenherr views the camp as a learning opportunity will come as no surprise to anyone who has seen him go about his business with the Predators. He played on two teams for the club last season — U16 Ubuntu and U18 Chaos — and excelled with both while paying attention to details that could make him a better player. “He is just an absolutely fabulous human being, teammate, competitor, leader, you name it. I can’t say enough good things about this kid,” said U18 Chaos coach Duncan Cairns. “He keeps a notebook that he writes down all of the things that he’s trying to work on and accomplish. He’s very attentive to detail in terms of fixing minutiae when it comes to his arm swing or his approach angles. He asks everybody in the gym for advice and help, but he’s discerning enough to know who to listen to and who not to listen to.” Schoenherr hasn’t been on a volleyball court since March when the pandemic hit and caused the cancellation of a trip to Poland as part of a Team Ontario Elite (17-18) team that had been selected in January.  Since then, he’s played a bit of beach volleyball while finding various ways to stay fit. “It’s safe to say this is the longest I’ve gone without playing since I started to play volleyball (at age 14),” he said. “The national team is training again in Gatineau (Que.) but we’re still waiting in Ontario.” Schoenherr has aspirations of playing volleyball at the university level in the fall of 2021 and down the road hopes to achieve the loftiest of goals by playing for Canada’s senior men’s team. Cairns is optimistic he’ll do both. “He could throw a dart at a map of North America right now and he could go to any school he wants ... and he has the marks to do it as well,” Cairns said. “He could be an international sensation for us.” Schoenherr is a well-rounded athlete who has played many other sports during his time at Bluevale, including hockey, basketball, badminton and track and field in discus, shot put, javelin and long jump. He won an Ontario Federation of School Athletics Association bronze medal in the discus in his Grade 9 year."

Police contacted the London-area resident after he posted a 15-minute video last month on Instagram alleging an older teammate pressured him to use cocaine in 2016 at a nonsanctioned team party during his rookie season. After talking with Guest, officers were told he did not want to proceed with a criminal investigation. Guest has since posted a new eight-minute video on Instagram where he made additional hazing allegations and continued to detail a toxic hockey culture. The 20-year-old said he’s making his experiences public in hopes that other players won’t have to go through similar things. “For me, if I would have known what I was going to go through to try and play in the NHL … I think I would have chose a different sport to play,” he said. “It’s sad because I gave my entire life to hockey.” The Ontario Hockey League is investigating his claims and, like the Rangers, refusing to comment while the review is ongoing. In the latest video, Guest recounts how he was suspended for five games for verbal abuse in a game against the Sudbury Wolves in 2016. The Record has since learned that he made a derogatory comment toward Jewish player David Levin. According to Guest, about a week later at practice a Rangers coach used a racial slur while talking about his time playing in the National Hockey League. “This coach was proud of, like, his wittiness,” said Guest, in the video. “For me, I’m just sitting there and I’m like, ‘What do I do?’ This is my coach that has just said this to me and … what am I supposed to do there?” Head coach Jay McKee and assistant Matthew Barnaby were the only Kitchener bench bosses with NHL experience during the 2016-17 season. McKee, when reached after Guest’s first video was posted, said he did not want to comment on any allegations while they were being investigated by the league. Barnaby addressed the situation on Twitter by posting: “I don’t usually respond to these bc (because) they are ludicrous but speculation that I used the N word is completely false.” Guest, who has openly talked about dealing with mental health issues, also said that he was mocked by a coach while taking medication, though it’s unclear if he’s referring to his time with the Rangers or last season which he split between the Caledonia Corvairs and London Nationals in the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League. “I was on medication because, like, (I was) trying to figure out what’s going on with me, trying to get better,” he said in the video. “I was pretty fat. I was on this team and the coach … he’d just call me fat. There was one time I was sitting in the dressing room and I was sitting there, listening to him talk and he goes ‘Guesty, are your meds kicking in?’ And he says this in front of the whole team just to like, I don’t know, belittle me.” Former NHL player Daniel Carcillo is currently at the forefront of a class-action lawsuit against the Canadian Hockey League after outlining a list of disturbing hazing allegations he said he endured while playing for the Ontario Hockey League’s Sarnia Sting in the early 2000s. But Guest says, in his video, that hazing still exists today, adding that rookies have allegedly been forced to slow dance while naked and wear dresses and makeup, among other things. “With hazing it’s, I don’t know, it’s still happening,” he said. “It’s just that kids are hiding it, kids aren’t telling people about it, but it’s happening. And it’s like some disturbing, gross, bad stuff going on.” Guest also alleged he wasn’t allowed to use the bathroom on the bus during road trips with the Rangers. “I would go to the back of the bus and say I need to go to the bathroom and the vets wouldn’t let me,” he said. “These are like hours on the bus and I wasn’t allowed to go to the bathroom.” The Rangers were contacted by The Record after both videos were released but the organization is firm in its stance to withhold comment until the investigation into the hazing allegations wraps up. The Record has also contacted Guest, but he said he wants to do his talking through social media. Guest was a third-round draft pick by the Rangers in 2016 and played parts of three seasons with the club before returning home for personal reasons."

He fits the plan. And he’s interested in playing in the Ontario Hockey League next season. So, the Kitchener Rangers didn’t hesitate to grab Czech goalie Pavel Cajan with the 41st pick in Tuesday’s Canadian Hockey League import draft. “It’s never easy because you’re not scouting him all year and it’s limited to a certain extent,” said Rangers coach and general manager Mike McKenzie. “But we were pretty happy to select him. We think he can be a good goalie in our league.” Kitchener originally had the 49th pick but moved up eight spots due to other teams passing. CHL clubs are allowed to dress two import players and the keeper joins Finnish defenceman Ville Ottavainen to fill the Rangers’ quota. Cajan, who turns 18 in October, is the first goalie Kitchener has ever selected in the import draft. The six-foot-two, 174-pounder came up through Liberec Bili Tygri’s system and played for the Czech Under-18 squad where he posted a 1.55 goals against average and .917 save percentage in three games. “He’s got a little bit of everything,” said McKenzie. “He’s a good-size kid, is pretty quick, has good reflexes and is athletic, but he’s not a guy that plays out of control. He’s calm that way. He fit what we look for in a goalie.” The Rangers knew Cajan was eager to join the OHL this season and the goalie confirmed it in a post-draft conversation with the club.  His addition also clarifies the team’s plan in net. “We’re big believers that you don’t see the best in goaltenders until their last year or two in the league,” said McKenzie. “We wanted to find a guy that wasn’t too young but also one that wouldn’t just be here for one season and be gone.” The starting job still has to be won but Cajan looks to be the main man for the next two years before passing the baton to 15-year-old Jackson Parsons, who was a third-round pick in this year’s OHL draft. Veteran Lucas Pfeil is also eligible to return for his overage campaign. “We think pretty highly of Jackson Parsons,” said McKenzie. “But we also want to make sure that we’re giving him a chance to be successful and not putting him in a situation where he doesn’t feel comfortable. We want to bring him along at the proper pace to keep his confidence high. “The age gap fits well with what we’re trying to do with where our team is at this year and where we think it will be at after this year as well.” The Rangers passed with their second selection in Tuesday’s draft. Ottavainen signed a deal with Oulun Karpat in the Finnish professional hockey league this past April but the Rangers were told by his agent that his plan is to return to Kitchener. The big Finn was the team’s first-round pick (35th overall) in last year’s import draft and finished with 15 points in 53 games. The Rangers selected defenceman, and Arizona Coyotes prospect, Axel Bergkvist in the second round of last year’s import draft. Bergkvist has since turned pro with BIK Karlskoga, a team in the Allsvenskan, which is the second highest level of hockey in Sweden. North Bay had the first overall pick in Tuesday’s two-round online draft and took Russian winger Matvei Petrov. In all, 66 players were selected from 10 countries."

The panel, which was unanimously agreed to by the CHL’s board of directors on Thursday, will also examine the allegation that players don’t feel comfortable reporting such incidents. The announcement comes in the wake of a series of allegations of abuse made by former players, including ex-Kitchener Rangers forward Eric Guest, who said he was pressured to use cocaine by an older teammate at a party during his rookie season in 2016. Former NHL player Daniel Carcillo is also at the forefront of a class-action lawsuit against the CHL after outlining a list of disturbing allegations he said he endured while playing for the Sarnia Sting in the early 2000s. The lawsuit alleges rookies were forced to sit in the middle of the dressing room shower naked while older players urinated on them, had their bare buttocks hit with a goalie stick, were forced to strip naked and crammed in a bus bathroom and had to bob for apples in a cooler filled with urine and saliva, among other things. “We are deeply troubled by the allegations in the recently announced class action, many of which are historic in nature and we believe are not indicative of the leading experience our players receive in the CHL today,” the statement said. “Regardless of the timing, we are taking the claims very seriously as the protection of our players has been and will always be our primary concern.” The CHL plans to appoint a chair to the panel in the weeks ahead and to have “a review process” completed by the beginning of next season. “We welcome the findings of the independent review panel to ensure we are providing the safest player experience in hockey and amateur sport,” the statement said. The CHL oversees 1,400 junior hockey players in its three leagues — the Ontario, Quebec and Western hockey leagues. “The CHL is committed to ensuring them an environment that is Players First and free of hazing, abuse, harassment and bullying, and that provides zero tolerance for any of these behaviours,” the statement said. “To the extent that the allegations relate to criminal conduct we encourage those involved to contact the police.” Over the past two decades, the CHL has been working with groups such as the Canadian Mental Health Association, Canadian Red Cross and Respect in Sport to help deal with hazing, abuse, harassment and bullying. Currently, players are encouraged to reach out to their coach, general manager, police liaison, player liaison or governor/member or league officials, if they have any concerns about the way they are being treated."

This country’s oldest professional league, which was forced to halt its 2019-20 schedule in March because of COVID-19, has announced eight teams will participate in the 10th season that is tentatively slated to start Boxing Day. “We’ve been subject to a lot of inquiries in terms of what’s happening with our future and whether we’re coming back, so now with the economy opening up and regions moving into Phase 2, we felt it was a good time to tell our fan base that we are very much excited about coming back,” said league deputy commissioner Audley Stephenson. “Health officials are going to guide us and give us direction ... but we thought now was a good time to inspire a little confidence as we turn around as a society if you will.” Kitchener-Waterloo Titans owner Leon Martin is on the record as saying his team would return for its fifth season if the league returns from the coronavirus. Stephenson said teams in London, Sudbury, Windsor, St. John’s, Halifax, Charlottetown and Moncton will also return. A league that requires gate receipts to survive, Stephenson admits the season won’t happen without the green light from health officials to play in front of spectators. The Titans play at the Aud and last season averaged 1,587 spectators in 11 home games. A crowd of 3,766 took in the Jan. 14 school-day game against the Island Storm and a season-low 938 were in attendance two days later for a Thursday night game against the Windsor Express. Additional details will follow as they become available, said Stephenson."

Which is ironic, since speaking out was one of the hurdles one-time Kitchener Rangers forward Eric Guest faced while playing in the Ontario Hockey League. And I get it.  The OHL and the Rangers are refusing to comment because there is an ongoing investigation into the alleged hazing Guest says he dealt with while playing for the Blueshirts in 2016. It would be premature for them to discuss the allegations Guest made last week in an Instagram video. When the investigation wraps up, league and Rangers officials can have their say about his claim that a veteran teammate pressured him and another youngster to use cocaine in a locked bathroom at a nonsanctioned party during his rookie season. But Guest’s 15-minute video also raised a myriad of issues that all players can relate to. Things that, regardless of the outcome of the investigation, need to be examined. Look, the Rangers run a tight ship. I’ve seen it firsthand for more than a decade. I can’t tell you how many players, parents, agents, scouts and coaches rave about the club. The team’s reputation is that solid. General manager and coach Mike McKenzie is approachable and a real student of the game. Jay McKee, who was behind the bench for Guest’s tenure, might just be the nicest and most level-headed person I’ve met in junior hockey.  They both clearly care about their players. So, I don’t think there is malice, ignorance or ego driving things on East Avenue.  But despite efforts to create an inclusive environment, there is a palpable disconnect between veterans and rookies — here and around the OHL. Guest captured the dynamic well in his video. “When you’re young in that league ... you listen to what the older guys tell you,” he said. “You don’t really have a voice.” Former Rangers defenceman Connor Hall echoed those feelings when reached last week: “As a 16-year-old you’re scared. Until you get comfortable with the guys you’re scared in the room. You don’t talk, you don’t do anything.” Guest also said he found it hard to leave home to play hockey. And he’s not alone. “Moving away from home is a big culture shock for a 16-year-old,” said Rangers alumnus Jacob Cascagnette. “I experienced that when I was 19 moving to Mississauga (after being traded by Kitchener). I know what Guest was going through (in that respect).” Guest said he “hated” his billet house during his rookie season, so much it made him cry. And while the Rangers vet and have some amazing billets, not all pairings mesh. “There have been multiple guys that have had different billets just because it wasn’t a right fit,” said ex-Rangers forward Jonathan Yantsis. “Some families want you to be a complete part of their family and go to family gatherings and stuff, whereas other people are more laid back and let you do your own thing.” But the biggest takeaway from Guest’s video is that he didn’t feel comfortable speaking to coaches, management or even his parents about some of the hardships he was going through. “I lied to my parents for years when I lived there (in Kitchener) and said like ‘Oh, I’m fine, I’m doing well, like I’m mentally OK’,” he said, in the video.  “I lied to them because I wanted to play in the NHL. When you’re in that situation you’re going to do anything you can. You’re going to bury your feelings, your thoughts and try and make that dream come true. That’s what I was doing.” He didn’t want to complain or be seen as a problem. He wanted to “fly under the radar.” That kind of pressure seems suffocating. And it’s heartbreaking to hear. While the investigation into Guest’s allegations of a cocaine incident is ongoing, his video goes deeper than illicit drugs. It speaks to larger issues that every player can relate to, some more than others. They are issues that aren’t unique to the Rangers. They likely run through every OHL club — and they need to be talked about."

But the team was thrust into the spotlight this past Monday when former forward Eric Guest shared his experiences of playing for the Ontario Hockey League club in an Instagram video. In it, the 20-year-old made some serious allegations. The story continues to evolve. What are the allegations? The biggest one is that an unnamed NHL-drafted player told Guest and another young player at a team party to join him in the bathroom where he locked the door and pressured them to do cocaine. “He locks the door and … he said you guys aren’t leaving this bathroom until you do this. He said you’re not leaving the bathroom until you do cocaine, basically is what happened,” Guest said in the video. Guest also addresses toxic masculinity in sport, a party lifestyle of drinking and drugs in junior hockey, “hating” his billet situation in Kitchener, the pressure of playing in the OHL and not being comfortable talking to coaches or management about these issues. When did it happen? The party occurred about a month into the 2016-17 season. Who is investigating? The OHL launched an investigation once it became aware of the situation and issued this statement on Tuesday: “The League became aware of Eric Guest’s accusations for the first time last evening. These allegations constitute a serious violation of OHL rules and include allegations of criminal conduct. We have reached out to Eric, requested an immediate meeting to receive the pertinent details and to initiate an investigation. Once we have spoken to Eric we will have a better understanding of the next steps.” The Rangers also released a statement on Tuesday: “The Kitchener Rangers became aware of the allegations made by Eric Guest for the first time last night. These allegations involve former players with our team and are extremely serious and potentially criminal conduct. As a result, we have contacted the Waterloo Regional Police Services. We will participate with the Commissioner and the League in their investigation. Until the investigation is complete the club will be making no further comments.” There is no indication how long the investigation will last. It could be days or weeks. Who is Eric Guest? Guest hails from Kilworth, which is west of London. He was Kitchener’s third-round draft pick in the 2016 OHL draft (47th overall) and spent parts of three seasons with the team. He left the club in mid-February of 2019 to return home. At the time, the Rangers did not provide anymore details, out of respect for his privacy. Guest said on his Instagram video and on a podcast that he has dealt with mental health issues. Who allegedly supplied the cocaine? According to Guest, it was an NHL-drafted player. There were five on the team at the time. One of them, defenceman Connor Hall, a former Pittsburgh Penguins prospect, told The Record it was not him. Who was leading the team at the time? Former NHL defenceman Jay McKee was the head coach. He was fired last November but that decision had nothing to do with drugs, Guest or any kind of culture problem, the team said this week. McKee’s one-time teammate, Matthew Barnaby, was an assistant coach along with Jason Fortier. Mike McKenzie was an assistant coach/assistant general manager. Murray Hiebert was the GM. Barnaby and Fortier are no longer with the club. McKenzie replaced Hiebert as GM in March of 2017 and remains in that post today. Hiebert is a senior adviser and scout with the team. What has the reaction been? Some former teammates have come out in support of Guest and feel no player should ever be put in a situation like he was with the alleged cocaine incident. Others can sympathize with his concerns about billets and not being comfortable speaking up as a rookie. Players admitted they attended some parties that season but played down the insinuation that there was a party lifestyle going on. Are OHL players tested for drugs? Yes. Random, unannounced testing, under World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) guidelines, occurs throughout the season. According to the OHL’s website, a drug education and antidoping program is provided by the league and developed and administered by the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport. The program includes an annual online education program for players and staff. What is the OHL’s stance on hazing? The OHL has a zero-tolerance policy for hazing and abuse. In 2009, the league’s board of governors created the OHL Enforcement Program in an attempt to eliminate hazing and impose penalties if violations occur. Every year, players must acknowledge in writing that they understand the policy and are encouraged to talk about any concerns they have. How has the OHL dealt with hazing in the past? In 2005, the OHL fined the Windsor Spitfires $35,000 and suspended Moe Mantha one year as general manager and 40 games as coach after older players forced rookies to strip and then locked them in the bathroom of the team’s bus on the way home from an exhibition game in London. In that case, commissioner Dave Branch spent about two weeks interviewing staff and players before announcing the penalties. About two years ago, former NHLer Daniel Carcillo took to Twitter to explain his alleged hazing and bullying suffered while playing for the Sarnia Sting as a 17-year-old during the 2002-03 campaign. In it, he talked about being hit with a sawed-off paddle from a goalie stick, being made to sit on the shower floor while veterans urinated and spit chewing tobacco on or near rookies and being forced to bob for apples in a bucket filled with waste, including urine and spit. Thursday, Carcillo and former player Garrett Taylor filed a lawsuit against the Canadian Hockey League, WHL, OHL and QMJHL alleging that players aged 15 to 17 were hazed, bullied and physically, verbally and sexually harassed.

Like most teenagers, members of the Kitchener Rangers would get together once in awhile to bond. Sometimes alcohol was involved. But life outside of the Aud was not party central, former players who donned the red, white and blue say. “There wasn’t a big party atmosphere,” said 21-year-old winger Jonathan Yantsis, who played with the Rangers for the past four years. “But let’s say we did have a day off, the older guys might go out for drinks. But the younger guys would stay at home and get ready for school. “It wasn’t like we were going out every night drinking. You choose your spots when you’re older. You’re still trying to make the NHL and be a professional.” The culture surrounding the Ontario Hockey League club was questioned earlier this week when ex-winger Eric Guest posted a video on Instagram alleging an older unnamed player forced him to use cocaine when he was a rookie at a nonsanctioned team party in 2016. “So he takes me and this other kid into the bathroom,” Guest, who was 16 at the time, recounted in the video. “He locks the door and … he said you guys aren’t leaving this bathroom until you do this. He said you’re not leaving the bathroom until you do cocaine, basically is what happened.” The OHL has since launched an investigation and, along with Rangers brass, will not comment on the alleged incident, at this time. When reached, Guest, now 20, said he too did not want to comment further and would continue communication through his personal videos. Like Guest, Yantsis also joined the Rangers in 2016 but not until later in the season when he inked a deal as a free agent. “I wasn’t around for the rookie party or anything,” he said. “I don’t know what he experienced personally. For myself, I’ve never seen that or heard of that going on with our team. No one has ever pressured me or put me in a situation where that has happened. “Sure, there is some pressure to drink at a party with older guys but it’s not like they’re forcing liquor down your throat. Most teenagers are going to drink but nobody was forced into anything they were uncomfortable with, from my experience.” In his video, Guest said the teammate who had the cocaine was a drafted NHL player. There were only five players who fit that profile with the Rangers at the time. Blueliner Connor Hall, a former Pittsburgh Penguins prospect, was one of them. “It wasn’t me,” he said. “I don’t want to comment too crazy on it. Looking at the other guys, they’re all on NHL deals. It’s not going to look good on anyone until the actual name of the person who did it comes out, whether it was a drafted player or not.” In the video, Guest, who played with the Rangers from 2016-19, also said: “... It’s like a partying lifestyle almost going through junior hockey and whatnot. I’ve seen it. Drinking problems, drug problems. It’s super common.” Hall admitted players got together for parties probably “four to five times a year.” Older players, of age, would also go to bars on days off, at times. But players had to adhere to a rotating curfew, depending on the day of the week. The 22-year-old also said the reality that someone could just text Rangers general manager Mike McKenzie, or other team staff, curtailed nights out. “From my five years being there we were pretty squeaky clean outside of hockey,” said Hall. But management can’t be everywhere. Guest didn’t feel comfortable sharing his negative experiences with the team, at the time. “You can’t go to your coaches, your GMs and say this stuff is happening in the locker-room,” he said, in the video. “They just don’t know about it. But this kind of stuff happens.” Hall said he can sympathize. “I feel like it (the alleged cocaine incident) would be a tough thing to go to someone about while you’re on the team, like he said,” said Hall. “As a 16-year-old you’re scared. Until you get comfortable with the guys you’re scared in the room. You don’t talk, you don’t do anything. “But in saying that, if it hurts you that bad … and if it hurt me in the way it hurt Guesty, I’m telling someone. I’m going into Mike McKenzie’s office, whether I’m 16 or 21, and saying something.” Jacob Cascagnette played parts of four seasons with the Rangers, before moving on to stints with the Mississauga Steelheads and Ottawa 67’s. He was at the party in question, but didn’t see any cocaine or hear about the story until this week. “I treated the rookies with respect and the rookies treated me with respect,” said the Kitchener native, who was a 19-year-old veteran at the time. “It’s just disappointing. I’m not sure who did it. I know the Rangers are a first-class organization and for something like this to happen, it shouldn’t happen in any locker-room. “My experience with off-ice stuff is that we had a close group with the Rangers each year and ... there was nothing along the lines of hazing or anything.  “But for this to happen is just sad. When the news came out it was just unbelievable. I was just embarrassed to even be a part of a roster where that happened.” Yantsis said he was close with Jay McKee, who coached the Rangers from 2016-19, and current assistants Dennis Wideman and Andreas Karlsson. “I knew I could go and talk to them if I had any problems,” he said. “I could go in there and talk about the stress of playing or if I had any problems at home that I needed to talk about. Personally, I had a great experience there (in Kitchener). There are people that are going to take care of you and care about you.”"

The Ontario Hockey League club is looking to make a more impactful stamp on the community through a new venture dubbed Rangers Reach. The independent nonprofit organization will run at arm’s length of the team and look after the community support and donations previously managed by the franchise. The break allows the Rangers to focus on hockey while Rangers Reach can take care of all the goodwill the team has done for decades. “The amount of community appearances and other things that are happening pulls people away … from making sure that the hockey business is growing,” said Rangers Reach executive director Craig Campbell. “So they decided it was time to have someone to manage their community giving portion.” Since 2002, the Rangers have allocated more than $15 million to sports scholarships, facility upgrades, ticketing programs, kids sports and several community groups such as the YMCA and KidsAbility, among others. The team distributed $467,000 to charities alone in the 2019 fiscal year. And that generosity will continue with Rangers Reach. The group immediately takes over two prominent initiatives in the annual Remembrance Day sweater auction and the community ticket initiative. The latter, which was quietly rolled out last season, gave tickets to social agencies, such as the House of Friendship, so they could treat their staff, volunteers and users to a night out. Rangers Reach will also co-ordinate the team’s monetary donations to various local groups. A grant committee will review and fulfil donation requests. Campbell is the sole paid part-time staff while the board of directors is made up of three community staples in chair Tim Jackson (president and chief executive officer of Shad Canada), Lynne Short (vice president of the Kitchener Waterloo Community Foundation) and Kelly McManus (senior director, community relations and events at the University of Waterloo). The idea for Rangers Reach was conceived by outgoing chief operating officer Steve Bienkowski, who retires at the end of the month. “I thought it was really important that we get this out before Steve steps down,” said Jackson. “To me this is all a part of Steve’s legacy. He has been committed to giving back to the community.”"

And after a stop-start pre-season due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 23-year-old from L’Ancienne-Lorette, Que., is savouring her time with New Jersey’s Sky Blue FC. “It was a special feeling, for sure,” Viens said of making her league debut off the bench against the OL Reign. “Being new in the league and just being able to play (soccer), I think it’s an amazing feeling. “But with everything (that happened), with the coronavirus, not knowing if we were even going to have a season, just being able to see soccer and play soccer with the best players in the world, it was a great feeling for me.” Sky Blue (1-1-1) faces the unbeaten North Carolina Courage on Monday at Zions Bank Stadium in Herriman. The Courage (3-0-0) have already advanced to the tournament quarterfinals as top seed. “Everyone knows how good they are,” Viens said of the Courage, who won the league title in 2018 and ‘19 and were runners-up in 2017. “But I think just being able to put a good game plan and just being able to do what we do best and play our style of soccer, we can go there and hopefully win the game.” The game could be a battle of Canadian goalkeepers, pitting North Carolina’s Stephanie Labbe against Sky Blue’s Kailen Sheridan. Sky Blue is coming off a 2-0 win Wednesday over the Houston Dash that saw Viens come off the bench in the 82nd minute. Viens entered in the 77th minute of Sky Blue’s tournament opener — a 0-0 tie June 30 with the OL Reign. She started the next game, playing the first half of Sky Blue’s 1-0 loss to the Utah Royals on July 4. Viens was taken fifth overall at the Jan. 16 NWSL draft in Baltimore. Defender-midfielder Rebecca Quinn is the only Canadian to go higher, selected third overall in 2018 by the Washington Spirit. Viens’ first crack at training camp lasted just five days because of the pandemic. She rode out the lockdown with other Sky Blue rookies before the teams returned to training. “When we came back to soccer, it was such a great feeling just being able to do our job and what we love,” she said. Viens turned heads at the University of South Florida, scoring 73 goals in 77 career games to set school and American Athletic Conference all-time records. Her 25 goals as a senior also set school and conference single-season marks. She showed time and time again that she can beat defenders and score from distance with a powerful shot. Her career 169 points and 360 shots were also school and conference records. She also set conference records for points per game (2.19), goals per game (0.95) and shots per game (4.68). Viens, a three-time all-American and 2019 Scholar all-American, was named AAC Offensive Player of the Week a conference-record six times in 2019. It’s all the more impressive given Viens’ English was limited when she started school in Florida. Former roommate Aubrey Megrath described Viens’ English as “zero.” “Every time we would talk like ‘Hey, how are you?’ every (answer) was, ‘Good.’ Anything you’d say to her, ‘Good,’” Megrath told the Tampa Bay Times. Hard work and help from the school changed that. She had not planned to go to a U.S. college but caught the eye of a USF assistant coach who saw her play while scouting a player on the opposing team. They invited her to come see the school. “One visit and I was like ‘I think the Florida’s the place for me.’ It was a great chance to develop as a person and as a soccer player. It really turned my life around.” Part of the reason Viens flew under the radar was she was not part of Quebec’s provincial team, because it would have meant leaving her family to go to Montreal. Viens was selected for Canada’s provisional roster for the CONCACAF Olympic qualifying tournament in January but did not make the final roster. She hopes she can play her way into a Canadian camp invitation. “I would like to represent my country but at the same time I just want one chance in camp, just to be able to learn from the best there and be able to compete with them. That would be a great opportunity.” North Carolina defeated Sky Blue 3-2 when they met in the 2019 regular-season finale."

Specifics are in short supply as Emily Penney looks ahead to her freshman campaign as a student-athlete at Oakland University in Auburn Hills, Mich. Penney accepted a scholarship last fall to compete for the Golden Grizzlies soccer team and is now waiting for word from head coach Juan Pablo Favero on whether the season will transpire. The uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is unfamiliar territory for the 17-year-old Penney, a soon-to-be Galt Collegiate graduate who has played competitive soccer for more than a decade and is excited about taking the next step to an NCAA Division 1 program. “We might not even be able to move in on our original report date because we don’t know what’s happening with this thing,” said Penney, a personable honour-roll student. “I don’t know anything yet and the coach doesn’t know anything yet, but, when he does, I will be one of the first to know, especially with me being an international student.” Penney, a technically gifted midfielder, made an impression on Favero at a one-day showcase camp in December 2018 and a connection was made. The two discussed how scholarships worked during their initial meeting, stayed in touch through emails over the next few months, and Penney made a verbal agreement during a return trip to Oakland in March 2019. She signed a national letter of intent during a ceremony at her high school in November. “Emily is a strong and athletic midfield player who will add much-needed depth to our central midfield,” Favero said on Oakland’s athletic department website. “She is a ball winner and will be able to cover a lot of ground and will give us the flexibility of playing in different midfield shapes. We are superexcited to see her in our uniform.” The well-travelled Penney — she has played for rep teams in Kitchener, Cambridge, Burlington, Waterloo and, most recently, Hamilton — said she “fell in love” with the campus during her visits and was excited about the “intense, fast-paced and physical” style of play she witnessed in an exhibition game between her future team and the Michigan State University Spartans. Penney planned to play for Hamilton United’s League 1 reserve team before making her way to Oakland, but the global pandemic has changed everything. She last played an indoor game in March and has since been training on her own, juggling the ball, kicking it against a wall, dribbling through cones and setting aside plenty of time for running to stay as fit as possible. “We just got our fitness packets from the coach, so I started that for the month of June, but that’s really it,” said Penney. “It’s kind of weird. You have to push yourself a lot harder because there’s no one to compete against.” Penney has been a fierce competitor during her four years at Galt and was a key player on the basketball team that won a Waterloo County (WCSSAA) championship in October, the school’s first senior girls title in 40 years. Hopes of taking Galt’s soccer program to similar heights this spring were dashed by the pandemic, as were plans to attend an athletic banquet, graduation ceremony and senior prom. “It’s kind of sad how it ended,” she said. On the soccer pitch, Penney’s career highlight to this point took place in the summer of 2016 when the Waterloo U14 team she was playing for captured the Ontario Cup and finished third at the national championships in New Brunswick. Greater achievements, she hopes, are around the corner at Oakland. The Golden Grizzlies compete in the 10-team Horizon League and last year reached the conference semifinal. The young squad lost just three players to graduation and Penney was one of seven added during the fall signing period. Regardless of whether there’s a season or not, Penney will study health sciences in her first year of university."

The multidimensional guard, who earlier this year led the Eastwood Rebels to a second consecutive appearance at the all-Ontario (OFSAA) championship, recently accepted a full scholarship to attend Gillette College and compete for the Pronghorns in the National Junior College Athletic Association. The commitment, he hopes, will lead to an opportunity to compete for an NCAA Division 1 program. “I’ve talked a lot with (Pronghorns head coach Shawn Neary) and he’s excited to have me and I’m excited to be going. I feel like there’s going to be a place for me (on the roster) and I’m thankful to be getting a good education at the same time,” said Ujullu Obang. “The program has a history of sending point guards to D1 and that’s important too. Coach Shawn has already told me there are a few D1 coaches that are interested in me, want to see me play and see what I’m about.” The Pronghorns finished last season with a record of 26 wins and six losses and sent three players to NCAA Division 1 programs with two others possibly to follow. The season ended with a loss to Western Wyoming Community College in the Region IX semifinals. Roster turnover is the nature of the beast for two-year junior colleges, so Ujullu Obang will be given every opportunity to step in and make an immediate impact. “We’ve done very well with Canadian guys, they’ve come in here and they fit in really well,” said Neary. “Ladera’s a high-level guard, we’ve had success with bigger guards (six-foot-four) like him and I think he fits in well with the way we play. Defensively, I think he can guard multiple positions, and offensively he’s skilled, he can shoot, score and pass. He’s a good pickup for us and I think he could be a high-level player in America before it’s all done.” Ujullu Obang has been a dominant force for Eastwood the past two seasons and recently became the first player to twice win the Mike Moser Memorial Award as the most valuable player in the Waterloo County Secondary Schools Athletic Association senior boys basketball league. His athletic and unselfish style of play led to talks with Ryerson, Brock, Carleton and Windsor on this side of the border, as well as handful of junior colleges in the United States. He had talked with several Division 1 programs in his Grade 12 year, including Georgetown University, but nothing came from it and Ujullu Obang returned for a fifth year at Eastwood. “It’s a business and I didn’t let it bother me. I wasn’t a fit for whatever reason, and I kept working hard and kept moving forward,” he said. “I’m thankful for the situation I’m moving into now and I’m going to make the best of it, for sure.” Ujullu Obang has done his homework on taking the junior college route and has talked with several players who have made the transition to NCAA Division 1. Ottawa native Abdul Mohamed plays at the University of North Texas after two years at Gillette, Kitchener’s Adham Eleeda played at Northern Kentucky after stints at Trinity Valley Community College in Texas and Sheridan Community College in Wyoming, and Cambridge native Zubair Seyed will play at Dixie State in Utah after spending time at Ryerson University and Daytona State College in Florida. “I’ve talked to all those guys, they’re all my friends, and I know what to expect,” said Ujullu Obang. Born in Ethiopia, Ujullu Obang has lived in Kitchener for seven years and started playing basketball in Grade 8 at Sunnyside Public School. He has since played with the academy team at St. John’s-Kilmarnock, as well as the Waterloo Wolverines and Toronto-based Canada Elite club teams. His older brothers, Cham and Hanani, were also basketball standouts at Eastwood who went on to play in the Ontario Colleges Athletic Association. Hanani wrapped up his third season with the Fanshawe Falcons earlier this year and Cham played for the Humber Hawks and Conestoga Condors. Ujullu Obang was to have learned about his Moser victory during the WCSSAA all-star game in March, but that event was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The cancellation also prevented Ujullu Obang from winning the slam-dunk competition that he placed second in one year earlier. “It’s a huge honour to win that award twice,” said Ujullu Obang. “But I really wanted to win the dunk contest this year.”"

Townes, a Grade 11 centre, led the Ghosts to an undefeated season in the WCSSAA senior girls basketball league that ended with a 41-27 win over the Bluevale Knights in the championship game. It was Galt’s first championship since 1979.  The Devenny most valuable player award is named after the former star player at Waterloo Collegiate and the University of Waterloo who died from cancer in 2012 at the age of 30.

Maple Leafs training camp is definitely new — and slowly starting to feel normal",['Kevin McGranStaff Reporter'],"Tue., July 14, 2020","Hockey players, bless ’em, are creatures of routine. But this Maple Leafs training camp — in July, with its nasal swabs and masks and social distancing — is anything but routine. They won’t go out at night. They won’t carpool. The only time they’re allowed to get close to each other are those bodychecks in the corner. The Leafs are doing their best to make it all sound so normal, a camp to prepare for an expanded summer-fall Stanley Cup tournament in which teams will share hotels while locking themselves away from their families and friends. “For the most part, we’re trying to keep it as normal as possible, the routines. You have to get out of your comfort zone a little bit. Might as well get used to it,” said centre Auston Matthews. “We’re wearing masks and social distancing, but around the rink we’re kind of doing the same thing (as usual),” said winger William Nylander. “It’s almost like normal to come in and get tested,” added winger Zach Hyman. “It’s the new normal. It’s a part of the process. It’s going to be part of the Stanley Cup playoffs. You can’t avoid it.” So the players have adapted to the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic as it affects their livelihood. For now, they are being tested every second day. It will ramp up to every day come July 26, when Toronto and Edmonton will host 12 teams each. All players were also tested and cleared before training camp. The dressing room, exercise facilities and bench are frequently sanitized. Winger Andreas Johnsson and defenceman Timothy Liljegren — listed as unfit to play — were seen wearing masks as they exited the locker room to watch teammates practise. Coaches and officials involved in the scrimmage did not wear them. All players must wear a mask whenever they aren’t working out or skating. “I’ve been wearing a mask as much as I can, and you almost want to desensitize yourself to it,” said veteran centre Jason Spezza. “The more you comply with it, the more you wear it, the more normal it feels and the less of a distraction it becomes, so that’s been the message. “You have to get on board quick, and then we’re able to play hockey.” Interactions with the media, and even team officials, are more or less off limits. Media access is limited to 22, each designated an X on the floor to stand — six feet apart — at the two rinks in use at the Ford Performance Centre. Media must also answer a health questionnaire and pass a temperature check before entering, and scrums are by teleconference. No one-on-ones. Players are discouraged from doing anything that would contribute to the spread of the virus. The league is asking them not to carpool, for example, and players are encouraging each other to avoid patios for dinner. And no one beyond their family (for the camp portion) and teammates should come into contact with them. They’re supposed to put their jerseys and anything else that needs laundering into a washing machine themselves, rather than a bin at the centre of the locker room. Hot tubs, saunas and steam rooms? Off limits. Showers? At home, not the rink, is preferred, and no shared towels or toiletries. Like the rest of us, they’re encouraged to wash their hands frequently, avoid handshakes, sneeze into a tissue or an elbow, and avoid anyone who might be sick. “Close contact” with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 — at a patio bar filled with strangers, for example — could sideline a player for 48 hours or more while waiting for test results. The league defines “close contact” as “15 minutes or longer at six feet or less.” The only exceptions to the distancing rule are for medical or therapeutic reasons and, of course, “scrimmages that involve body contact.” The Leafs are indeed scrimmaging. On Monday, coach Sheldon Keefe staged 20-minute mini-games with shortened benches, three lines aside. On Tuesday, Keefe played his power-play lines against his penalty-killing units for 30 minutes — complete with referees enforcing the rules, while players got back to changing in the fly and spacing on the ice. Eventually, Keefe will hold a full game scrimmage. When players are asked about the big differences at camp, they don’t talk about masks and social distancing. They focus on hockey answers. “It’s different in the sense that the urgency is there to hit the ground running,” said Spezza. “There’s no kind of dipping your toe in the water and then ramping up. We have a short camp, one exhibition game and then into the playoffs (starting Aug. 2 against Columbus).” So this new normal — designed to get the Leafs and the other 21 playoff-bound teams into game shape safely — is simply part of the furniture. “Strict adherence by all participants to preventative measures, diligent hygiene practices and enhanced testing will be key,” is how the NHL put it in guidelines sent to teams prior to training camp. “I don’t know if it’s normal, but it’s something we have to deal with,” said goalie Frederik Andersen. “To give ourselves a chance at winning, small precautions like that are going to be part of it, and something we’ll have to do as a team. “Putting a Q-tip up your nose every day is not so fun, but I think (we’re doing) the best thing we can and it’s our responsibility to keep each other safe.”"

Half of the 34 players on the first day of training camp worked out at 11 a.m. on the Marlies’ ice at the Ford Performance Centre, the other half about two hours later. In between, they played three mini-scrimmages. “It was a lot of fun,” said forward Mitch Marner. “You miss being around the guys. It was great to be back out there. You want to be back in the same room together, chirping each other.” There was hockey again. “Conditioning-wise, it wasn’t great,” said star centre Auston Matthews, who was off the ice for a couple of weeks after testing positive for COVID-19 in Arizona. “It was just great to be back here, back in Toronto, back with your teammates, doing what we all love.” There were some nifty goals by Marner and Ilya Mikheyev. Some nice saves by Frederik Anderson. A classic dipsy-do from Matthews. A shootout where William Nylander was the difference. And rookie Nick Robertson, wearing No. 89, undressed Jake Muzzin to create his own scoring chance. “He’s got that dogged mentality. He’s a hard-working kid,” Marner said of Robertson, the 18-year-old winger from the OHL’s Peterborough Petes who was the team’s second-round pick last year. “He’s not afraid to get in the dirty area. His shot’s pretty amazing. He was impressive to watch.” Sheldon Keefe had as healthy a lineup as he’s seen since taking over as head coach in November, with Mikheyev and Muzzin back from injuries. Andreas Johnsson (knee) remains out. Timothy Liljegren also missed practice, deemed unfit to play with no other information available. “Mikheyev looks excellent, and Muzzin as well,” said Keefe. “Those guys really haven’t had any time off. They continued to rehab their injuries and skated all the way through for the most part. It’s exciting to see them. Obviously we still miss Andreas. He’s an important piece of our team and we’re happy that he’s making progress toward a return. It was nice to see everybody else out there, otherwise.” Keefe said he designed the day to push the players’ conditioning. He expected things to get sloppy as the day went on. “We were trying to make the conditions difficult out there for the players,” said Keefe. “We had some important things we wanted to get accomplished in terms of our structure and our system. The parameters we set out — practising with just three lines, scrimmaging with just two lines — we wanted to make it difficult from a conditioning standpoint, so the overall pace of play went down as a result. That’s what I designed. They pushed through it.” They were tired at the end. “We’re all happy to be back at work,” said defenceman Morgan Rielly. “It’s a bit different in terms of some protocols, but as players we’re willing to do whatever it takes. The attitude is good. We’re excited to be back, to hang out together. “The main focus is to compete for a championship, but you’ve got to start somewhere.”"

Dr. Howard Njoo said Tuesday that discussions are ongoing between the Canadian government and the Major League Baseball team, but he said the issue of having both the Blue Jays and American-based teams continually crossing the U.S.-Canada border complicates the idea of hosting regular-season games. Njoo said the federal, Ontario and Toronto governments were comfortable with the measures the Blue Jays put in place to safely train as a team at the Rogers Centre. However, on the issue of crossing the border, he said Canada is in a different place than the U.S. with regards to COVID-19. “The issue of the regular season, I think, I was speaking to the potential of travel across the U.S.-Canadian border, not just the Blue Jays leaving town and coming back after a road trip but also for teams coming in, that also is obviously a totally different ball game,” Njoo said. “Those discussions are ongoing, but what I would say and you can certainly look at the data, is that the situation in Canada and the U.S. I would say from a pure epidemiological point of view is vastly different.” Njoo said while Canada typically records around 300 new COVID-19 cases daily, the United States records over 60,000 cases per day. “And certainly the situation doesn’t appear to be changing quickly in the U.S.,” he added. The Jays have stated their preference is to play at the Rogers Centre. Alternatives mentioned have been TD Ballpark in Dunedin Fla., in the middle of a coronavirus hot spot, or Sahlen Field in Buffalo, N.Y., which is not considered up to major-league standards. Dunedin is the Blue Jays’ spring-training site, while Buffalo is home to the Blue Jays’ triple-A affiliate. Njoo said even if teams visiting Toronto adhere to the same standards and protocols, the issue remains that the Blue Jays will be heading into the U.S. for road trips and coming back over the border. “If (visiting teams) do come to Canada and there’s a very tight quarantine bubble, they don’t leave the hotel and just go to the games, that’s one aspect,” he said. “But I can appreciate for the Blue Jays, for the players, that’s tough because they’ve had this very tight quarantine and work bubble for spring training here in Canada. But if they were to leave Canada and go on a road trip, it’s hard to look at all the factors involved in terms of what the risk might be for themselves leaving Canada and then coming back. “So there are lots of factors in play, and I can’t pretend to know all of the possibilities and things that need to be looked at, but that’s certainly I think a major issue in terms of travel back and forth across the U.S. border.” The Blue Jays’ season opener is July 24 at Tampa Bay. The home opener is July 29 against Washington. The 2020 season has 60 games, down from the usual 162."

The club’s career leader in games played, hits and triples, Fernandez died on Feb. 16 at age 57. The 1993 World Series winner and five-time all-star had battled kidney problems for several years. He was first hospitalized with polycystic kidney disease in 2017. Signed by the Blue Jays in 1979, the Dominican native played 12 seasons over four stints with the club. Fernandez hit .333 with nine runs batted in during the Blue Jays’ 1993 six-game World Series win over the Philadelphia Phillies. Fernandez’s name was placed on the Blue Jays’ Level of Excellence at Rogers Centre in 2001. “There are few players in the game who can impact a team and a fan base the way Tony did in Toronto,” Blue Jays president/CEO Mark Shapiro said in a statement. “Beyond his impressive career numbers, achievements, and accolades, Tony resonated with baseball fans because of how he played the game and conducted himself as a teammate. To wear a patch in his memory is to honour his exceptional life on behalf of Blue Jays fans across the country.”"

At least it certainly sounds that way, via Blue Jays skipper Charlie Montoyo, who disclosed Anderson’s injury to reporters on Sunday. But of course the manager doesn’t like to go anywhere near the whither-Nate question, no more so at summer training camp than four months ago at spring training camp, when the flame-throwing right-hander had observers drooling over his 100-m.p.h. heat. So, Anderson’s ailment apparently doesn’t open the door for Pearson to push his six-foot-six frame through it and into a Major League Baseball debut by the end of July. Ditto, a renaissance for the chronically elbow-stricken Ryan Borucki, also trying to crack the starting rotation. And nah, perish the thought that Pearson is being held back to manipulate his service time. Even though the gem of a pitching prospect only needs to spend just over a week off the major league roster for the club to secure an additional year of team control in 2026 — under the format prorated over a 66-day season. Montoyo claims he’ll leave that slot a pending thing, determined by how the arms show over the remaining 12 days of camp, should Anderson not be ready by the time the 60-game season launches for the Jays on July 24 in St. Pete’s versus the Tampa Bay Rays. “I love the fact all of the guys know they are competing,” said Montoyo. “We’re building them all, so they’re all going to have a chance to compete. We’ll see where we go a week and a half from now.” Anderson, said Montoyo, suffered the injury a couple of days ago. Up to a three- or four-inning pitching capacity at the moment, he may not be ready to take the starting ball out of the chute. Obliques can be touchy. The 32-year-old was acquired from Milwaukee in the off-season. In 32 games with the Brewers last year, he had an 8-4 record with a 4.21 ERA and 124 strikeouts over 139 innings. UP TO SPEED Trent Thornton was privileged to be given two keys back home during the pandemic break that cleaved a continental divide between spring and summer training camp. The first came from a buddy who turned over the key to the locked-down gym he owned, allowing Thornton to work out on the premises quarantine-alone. The second came from his old high school coach, allowed Thornton to use the playing field with one (1) other person. So, as baseball paralysis goes, Thornton could hardly ask for much more. “I feel great,” said the 26-year-old, who became an unlikely anchor in Toronto’s shredded starting rotation last year, his rookie season. “Threw the entire time I was home, so I really don’t think I missed a beat at all. With another week or two, I feel like I could just let the reins off.” The right-hander threw some 50 to 60 pitches in Sunday’s live BP session — no intrasquad game on this evening — and liked what he saw of himself, with an emphasis on the elevated fastball. With one MLB season under his belt, he’s also had a bellyful of big-league hitters at the plate, at least to the point that he no longer feels intimidated. The objective for this manic-paced 60-game schedule: “Just getting outs quick, going deeper into games, not trying to strike everyone out.” Because last year that often had him in situations where he threw upward of 100 pitches in a mere five innings. The native of Charlotte, N.C. was, back in March, presumed to be Toronto’s fifth starter, though there’s stiff competition for the job. “I want to be in the rotation as much as anybody, but you can’t take things like that for granted. I like to pitch with a chip on my shoulder. Nothing’s going to be handed to you so I just go about my business like that, just about every day.” Thornton does have one edge on his teammates. He lived all of last season at the hotel overlooking the Rogers Centre, where the team has been quarantined for this camp and may have to reside as well if the Jays are permitted to play their 2020 regular-season games in Toronto. “I know some guys aren’t ecstatic about him. But I did it all last year. It’s definitely doable. “It does get a little boring sometimes. But if that’s what we need to do to play, that’s perfectly fine by me.”"

Now we know,['Chris BumbacaUSA Today'],"Tue., July 14, 2020","It’s been an eventful off-season for Patrick Mahomes. The Super Bowl MVP recounted his life over the past few months — the post-season obligations, buying a new house, confronting a pandemic, supporting countrywide protests and signing a record-breaking contract worth up to $503 million (U.S.) — for a GQ story and photo shoot that published Tuesday. Mahomes revealed another important detail: rapper Post Malone now has the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback’s signature tattooed on his body. The 24-year-old told the magazine he and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce went backstage at Malone’s show in Kansas City. A few (several) games of beer pong later, Malone bet the duo that if they won again he’d get tattoos of their names. Post Malone stuck with his word and Mahomes claims the inking took place right backstage. Here’s some more insight about Mahomes from the story: “I understand my platform,” Mahomes told GQ. “I understand that my part in the video is a big part of it.” He’d spent time with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who sought his perspective. Mahomes informed the commissioner of his desire to promote voter-registration efforts and that the league should have one person dedicated to helping players tap into their community activism endeavours. “So whenever you wanna help out the community, you have someone that works with the team that can help,” Mahomes told GQ. “It was a great conversation. It lasted, like, 30 minutes to an hour.” “I’ve seen how people, on Twitter, have tweeted and said, ‘Oh, you’re not full Black,’” he told GQ. “But I’ve always just had the confidence and believed in who I am. And I’ve known that I’m Black. And I’m proud to be Black. And I’m proud to have a white mom too. I’m just proud of who I am. And I’ve always had that confidence in myself.” As the son of a former Major League Baseball player, Mahomes also is aware of his privileged upbringing. “The more I mature,” Mahomes told GQ, “I’ve learned that I was blessed to be in the situation that I was in.” “I’m nowhere near where I can be,” he told GQ."

Jackson accepted the consequences and apologized, the Eagles said. “In our many conversations with him, it has also been made clear that this is only the beginning. We have discussed a concrete plan for how he and we can heal moving forward. He understands that in order to remain on the team, he must also commit to supporting his words with actions,” the Eagles’ statement read in part. Because the Eagles are not announcing a suspension, it’s likely they have fined Jackson. Teams typically don’t announce the amount when they fine players. Jackson had initially posted a fake quote attributed to Adolf Hitler over the Fourth of July weekend. He reposted the fabricated quote on his Instagram story Monday attempting to clarify why he posted it. Following significant backlash to the posts, Jackson issued two apologies (one a video on Instagram, and one on Twitter), saying he would work to educate himself. Earlier Friday, Jackson virtually met with Edward Mosberg, a 94-year-old Holocaust survivor. “I’m taking this time to continue with educating myself and bridging the gap between different cultures, communities & religions,” Jackson wrote in his post about the meeting on Instagram. “I know he’s under the fire,” Eagles teammate Lane Johnson said of Jackson. “With everything that’s happened in the past months, I know his heart’s in a good place as far as helping the community and helping his people. Ultimately, whenever you make mistakes, you have to own up to it and I think the best thing about it now is get educated and try to make all the wrongs you did right. That’s all you can do.” “We appreciate (Jackson’s) desire to educate himself, but we all understand there is still a lot of work to be done,” the Eagles said in their statement. “We will continue to assist DeSean in this process, and we also know all of us in our organization need to listen and learn more about things that are unfamiliar or uncomfortable to us. “We must continue to fight against anti-Semitism and all forms of discrimination, while not losing sight of the important battle against systemic racism.”"

A CFL source said Friday the league is seeking roughly $42.5 million in aid. In April, it asked the federal government for up to $150 million in financial assistance in the event of a cancelled 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie said the league was anxious “to be accountable to taxpayers,’ and would attempt to repay a portion of government assistance through “community programs, tourism promotion, the Grey Cup, our digital channels.” The source added the new request is to cover operating costs and player salaries for a shortened 2020 season. The proposal also includes a letter of support from the CFL Players’ Association. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity because neither the government nor CFL have confirmed the request. Last month, the CFL and CFLPA began talks to amend the current collective bargaining agreement to allow for an abbreviated season. The two sides must sign off on any changes for any games to be played. But prior to the start of negotiations, the CFL presented the union with a memo outlining the conditions it wanted and a completion deadline of July 23. When asked about the revised financial request, the CFL said, “We continue discussions with the federal government including discussions on our possible return to play.” While the revision is for substantially less money, the CFL’s situation hasn’t changed much. It still requires financial assistance with revenues having dropped drastically due to the COVID-19 pandemic and expenses expected to continue to rise if it tries to play a season with no fans The CFL’s initial request of Ottawa consisted of three tiers: It called for $30 million immediately to manage the impact the outbreak has had on league business; additional assistance for an abbreviated regular season; and up to another $120 million in the event of a lost 2020 campaign. When Ambrosie spoke to a federal standing committee on finance in May, he was roundly criticized for failing to stipulate where the funds would go and not involving the CFLPA in the process. But the source said the revised proposal mirrors an authentic financial offer and contains more specific details than the original one did. The earliest an abbreviated ‘20 season will begin is September, but Ambrosie has stated a cancelled campaign also remains possible. If the CFL holds a shortened season, it’s expected to do so in a hub city. Winnipeg has been mentioned as a strong hub candidate, but the source said Regina also is under consideration."
214,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/sports/raptors/2020/07/14/the-raptors-still-have-eight-games-before-the-nba-playoffs-but-everybody-is-ready.html,"The Raptors still have eight games before the NBA playoffs, but ‘everybody is ready’",['Doug SmithSports Reporter'],"Tue., July 14, 2020","Nick Nurse knows how he would like to use the eight games the Raptors will play leading up to the NBA playoffs, and it sounds like a well-scripted exhibition season. The Raptors head coach plans to use the first two or three to get his entire roster familiar with the speed of NBA games again, with lots of players getting time on the court; the middle three or so would be to fine-tune the rotation and extend the minutes for the players Nurse will rely on in the post-season; and the last couple would be to taper a bit, calm down, try to avoid injury and get some rest for the workhorses. It makes sense, but in this nonsensical resumption to a season delayed four months, when everything is new and no one knows how it will all unfold, it may not be possible to pull off. “That would be my initial game plan, but obviously the ball goes up and everything changes, usually,” Nurse said on a conference call.  Figuring out how to use the “seeding games,” as the NBA is calling the final segment of the aborted regular season, will be a struggle for each of the 22 teams gathered near Orlando, Fla.  For 12 of those teams, the playoffs are already a guarantee and the only things to play for are seeding — starting with a doubleheader on July 30 — and game rhythm. How much seeding really matters is debatable since no team will have anything close to a “home-court advantage” on any of the three floors the NBA will use at the Disney/ESPN campus. The Raptors have a difficult schedule for the eight games left in the season. They will open against the Lakers on Aug. 1 and also face the Milwaukee Bucks, Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers, all tremendous opponents. It should give them a good indication of where they stand. “I like the schedule,” Nurse said. “I like to see the Lakers again and Milwaukee again, just to get a feel for them again. I think we’re playing really quality teams. I think every team we’ve got is a playoff team. Obviously those are quality teams. “I like it.” The players would like Nurse’s approach to ease into the final eight games with little or no pressure. None of them have played meaningful five-on-five basketball since the middle of March. “You can’t try to adjust this, that and the other. You have to have that same approach each and every game and figure it out as you go,” Raptor Norm Powell said. “It’s going to be a different feel with no fans and all of that, but the main focus is getting ourselves back to the level where we want to be and be able to compete and fight for a championship.” The Raptors are counting on their experience to get them through the most unusual circumstances, because every key member of the rotation went through 10 weeks of intense competition in the championship run of 2019.  “(The players) came here in great shape and, as soon as we got here, everyone was starting to put in work,” Serge Ibaka said. “I’ve been in the league for 11 years. You can see when people (are) locked in and they are ready mentally and when they are not. “So I can tell you right now, mentally, everybody is ready.” The Raptors, who opened camp in Orlando on Saturday after training in the Naples/Fort Myers area, were limited to small group workouts before joining the NBA bubble. It was frustrating not to have five-on-five time, but it’s not like it was going to change what the Raptors are or what they do before the games begin. It’s the same for their eight opponents: all good teams, legitimate championship contenders, staying true to themselves. “The teams that we’re going to face are probably going to be consistent toward who they were during the season,” assistant coach Adrian Griffin said. “When we play Milwaukee, you’ve got to prepare for Giannis (Antetokounmpo). He’s going to be Giannis. When we play the Lakers, LeBron (James) is going to be LeBron, Anthony Davis is going to be Anthony Davis. “We know these guys. They know us. We’ll prepare the best way we possibly can and let the chips fall where they may.”"

He is a bit prickly and something of a contrarian, not one to suffer fools gladly, and completely unwilling to bend to authority when he feels something is amiss. It makes him the perfect leader for this group of Raptors in this most unusual of NBA seasons: a veteran who questions everything that he feels needs to be questioned, someone the other players want to follow because of what he does on the court and, really, the conscience of the team. Ha arrived at the NBA’s Florida campus on the Disney grounds in excellent shape and ready to work. He showed up having played a significant role in the entire operation — from medical testing protocols to living conditions — and if he’s ready to go and content, the whole organization is ready to take its lead from him. For a team chasing a second straight championship, having the undisputed alpha male on board is immeasurably important. “I think Kyle is an incredibly smart, intelligent person, so when something isn’t quite right he’s going to bring it to your attention,” coach Nick Nurse said Monday. “I’m good with that. Listen, this is a partnership and a communication thing. It’s ‘we’ trying to get to some place. Feedback is important.” Lowry is certainly going to give it. In all matters. As a member of the players’ association competition committee, he worked with the league in setting up every facet of life for the 22 teams that are now gathered near Orlando for the resumption of the suspended season later this month. He was involved in developing testing protocols, scheduling, what is allowed and what’s not, and has made it clear to his teammates how important that is. He is the franchise’s conduit to a healthy existence. “It was interesting to come up with some of the concepts and to talk that over, and understand (not just) what we’re trying to do but how we’re trying to do it, and make sure that it’s done the right way for all the players, coaches, and it’s (as safe as) we possibly can do it,” Lowry said in his first group interview since the league suspended the season in March.  “I think that we’ve done a good job so far with the safety aspects, the health aspects. I think there’s definitely going to be some adjustments that need to be made, but that’s the one thing about our league and our professionals, is that we make adjustments on the fly and we’re able to.” So far, Lowry’s been more than pleased with how things are going and the Raptors have been more than pleased with his actions — on and off the court. They want him to lead and they need him to be the same player who helped Toronto to a championship more than a year ago. In the latter regard, they’ve never had a healthier, more rested Lowry going into the playoffs than they have now and they plan to ride him hard. “He’s just smarter in that way, and I think he’s got tremendous confidence,” Nurse said. “And I think as well he knows he’s got to be kind of a main cog, right? … You know he’s always going to play hard and make the defensive plays, but he’s got to be a main factor in the offence and he kind of carries himself that way this year a lot more.” There is an undeniable joy to the way Lowry conducts himself on the court, even if it is sometimes masked in an intensity that’s off the charts. The way he plays — taking charges and making big shots when he has to, but ceding the spotlight when that’s needed, too — rubs off on his teammates and now that he’s back among them, he’s whole again. He loved the break to spend time with his wife and two young sons at their Philadelphia home, but he’s happy to be back on the court with his peers. “You wanted to be more careful. You wanted to be in a situation where you want it to be safe, and understand that you have to be safe with your family,” he said. “But right now, it feels great to be able to get back on the basketball floor with your guys, your teammates — kind of getting the camaraderie back together and being around, and knowing that you’re about to do your job.” And safely. First and foremost, safely. “I think our protocols and our health and safety measures have been top notch. I think this thing will work perfectly,” he said. “The league, the players’ association, (have done) a phenomenal job of making sure that we’re doing everything that we can possibly do to make sure that we’re healthy, we’re safe and we’re in an environment where we can be successful and do our jobs at a high level.” And if he’s a bit thorny at times — like the four or so instances where he mocked reporters in a 13-minute conversation — that’s divorced a bit from his persona as a teammate. “I think he’s only thorny with you guys,” Nurse joked. “He is in tremendous shape. He’s practising hard, shooting the ball at an incredible rate. He looks great. I haven’t sensed the thorniness, so there you go.”"
216,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/sports/raptors/2020/07/12/the-transformation-of-marc-gasol-puts-the-raptors-in-even-better-shape-for-the-nbas-restart.html,The transformation of Marc Gasol puts the Raptors in even better shape for the NBA’s restart,['Doug SmithSports Reporter'],"Sun., July 12, 2020","Nick Nurse once joked that the new-look Marc Gasol was “chiselled,” and Norm Powell suggested the veteran Raptors centre looked more like a Barcelona soccer player than a basketball professional. The difference in Gasol, as least judging by photographs dotting various social media sites, is truly stark and the descriptions and observations are apt. Gasol is noticeably thinner, absolutely more muscular and apparently fitter than he’s been since he arrived in Toronto from Memphis about 18 months ago. But he’s also 35 years old and spent most of the interrupted NBA season fighting a nagging hamstring injury. No matter what the pictures look like or what his teammates and coaches say, erring on the side of caution with him these days makes the most sense. “Marc went for a good stretch of practice — the main bits — and just like I suggested, took himself out to kind of ease into it,” coach Nurse said Sunday after the Raptors’ second practice at the NBA campus on the Disney grounds just outside Orlando, Fla. “I think OG (Anunoby) did later on in the practice as well.” That’s why Gasol begged out of an expected electronic chat with the Toronto media: He’d left the practice facility well before the cameras were turned on. Nothing nefarious, Nurse said. Just a logistical issue after the player had done his work. It’s going to be that way for a handful of Raptors in the three-week period preceding the “seeding games” — starting Aug. 1 against the Los Angeles Lakers — that will signal the full resumption of the NBA season. “It’s a little similar sometimes to when you’re with the national teams. You go hard for a few days and then you might pull guys out and start sprinkling in some days off around the board, and Marc is certainly a candidate for that,” Nurse said. “Obviously I would even put Pascal (Siakam), OG, Freddy (VanVleet), Kyle (Lowry) into that group, too. Serge (Ibaka). “We’ll probably monitor it individually, but almost mandate some days off in there, again, to let their bodies kind of regroup for a full day and recharge as we get back here early.” But Gasol is the most important asset to protect because of his age and the sheer amount of basketball he’d played, for the Raptors and in Spain’s world championship run before the injuries that wrecked almost all of his 2019-20 season. He’s too valuable to the team, too integral to whatever success the Raptors will have, to overwork him now — no matter how good or healthy or thin he is. “He looks really, really good. He’s moving really well,” teammate Terence Davis II said. “He looks like Prime Marc to me, so I don’t know, man. It’s scary.” Gasol’s skills are undeniable and vital for the Raptors. The seven-footer is one of the best passing big men in the NBA — his ability to facilitate Toronto’s offence gives it an extra dimension most teams don’t have — and he is the club’s defensive anchor. Keeping him healthy, no matter what his body type is, and expanding his contribution is part of the plan in the training camp portion. “I think there’s probably some baskets in him in the fourth quarter or down the stretch (and we’ll) play a little bit inside out through him as well, because … any time we can get him the ball, good things happen,” Nurse said. “Not necessarily buckets from him, but good things happen.  “But (it’s) probably good to see if we can get his usage rate up. I’m working on it. I’m not sure it’s going to happen, but it is a thought in the forefront of what we’re doing.” Gasol will eventually spend time with the media and go through how and why he undertook this transformation so late in his career. It hasn’t been a hot topic of conversation while the Raptors have been working out in Florida, but Nurse said it has come up in casual chatter. “I did ask him about what was the key, what’d you do, and he just said: ‘Man, it was consistency,’” the coach reported. “With the situation we’ve all been in in the last four months, you take out the games and all the long road trips and the late-night flights, and all the things that factor into making fitness and nutrition a little harder … and he just said it was a consistent rhythm: eating at the same time every day and eating very healthy, obviously, and all that stuff.”"

He found at it Muirfield Village, and suddenly looks as though he’ll be tough to catch at the Workday Charity Open. Morikawa ran off four straight birdies after making the turn Friday, finished with another birdie and shot 6-under 66 to build a four-shot lead over Sam Burns (66) in the storm-delayed tournament. His 13-under 131 was one shot off the course record set by Jason Dufner in 2017 at the Memorial. The Workday Charity Open, which replaces the cancelled John Deere Classic for this year only, has been set up a little easier than it will be for the Memorial next year, with slightly slower greens and rough that isn’t quite as high or thick. Morikawa is still playing a different brand of golf than anyone else. Through two rounds, he has 15 birdies and an eagle. His four bogeys have come from silly mistakes that are bound to happen. Ian Poulter, back at Muirfield Village for the first time since 2009 because of a reconfigured schedule brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, had a 69 and joined Chase Seiffert (69) at 7-under 137. The second round had a pair of 75-minute delays because of the rumbling thunder and lightning that seems to appear whenever the PGA Tour is at Muirfield Village. “Who knows who’s going to take it deep today?” Morikawa said. “Whether I have the lead or not, I’ve got to go into the weekend feeling like I’ve got to make the same amount of birdies I have the past two days. I feel like there’s a lot of birdies out there for me especially, the way I’ve been hitting it.” Morikawa, who turned pro just over a year ago after graduating from Cal, is making his debut at the course Jack Nicklaus built, and perhaps it’s no coincidence that Nicklaus was famous for hitting a cut. “I had heard from a lot of people before, this course was going to suit a left-to-right shot, anyway,” Morikawa said. “Obviously, Jack hit that, and I think it does. But I’ve been able to leave myself some really good numbers into approach shots. I’ve been keeping myself in the fairway for the most part, and that obviously helps.” Among those playing in the afternoon, Jon Rahm and Brooks Koepka first had to worry about making the cut after sluggish starts. Koepka started at 2 over. Rahm was at even par. Phil Mickelson had another exciting day, minus the meltdown at the end of his round. He opened by chipping in for birdie and making a 12-foot eagle putt. With the tee moved forward on the 14th hole, the par 4 guarded by a pond right of the green, he hit driver to 10 feet and had to settle for birdie. And right before the first batch of storms arrived, Mickelson felt the wind shift and get stronger, so he took driver on the par-5 fifth and whaled away over the trees and just inside backyard fences. It settled in the rough, but it left him only 114 yards away and a pitching wedge to the green. The speed of the greens fooled him, and he repeatedly left putts short. Even so, he managed to post a reasonable number. Jordan Spieth wasn’t as fortunate. He took double bogey on his 17th hole, the par-3 eighth, and was likely to miss the cut. Morikawa had made 22 cuts in a row to start his pro career, a streak that ended two weeks ago at the Travelers Championship. That was three short of the streak Tiger Woods put together when he turned pro. But the 23-year-old Californian was more interested in low scores than simply getting in four rounds and a paycheque. “At the end of the day, you’re out there to win tournaments,” he said. “If you miss the cut, make it by whatever, you just want to learn from each week. And like I said, I learned a lot from those two days missing the cut than I have in a lot of events so far when I’ve been finishing whatever.” This one caused him to take a closer look at what was lacking in his game, instead of being reasonably content with a solid finish. “I think sometimes when something really doesn’t go your way, like missing a cut, it just stands out a little more,” he said. Somewhere along the way, he couldn’t rely on his cut shot, allowing him to aim some 6 yards left of his target and fade it toward the pin, no matter where it was located. It was after his practice round Wednesday that he figured out what was missing, and he went back to an old drill of sticking his glove under his left arm. It’s a rotational drill, and it paid off. He had to wait until the storms to see if anyone could catch him, with the second round not likely to end until Saturday."

Adam Hadwin of Abbotsford, B.C., posted the best score among Canadian golfers with a 6-under 66. He’s one stroke behind leader Collin Morikawa, who shot a 7-under 65. Nick Taylor, also of Abbotsford, was in a group of four golfers two shots behind back at 5 under, while Roger Sloan of Merritt, B.C., shot a 4-under 68 Thursday. He is in an 11-way tie for seventh place. Taylor is playing in his first tournament on tour since the PGA restarted last month during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hadwin, who shot his eighth consecutive round in the 60s, is coming off a tie for fourth last week at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit. Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., shot 2-under 70, while David Hearn of Brantford carded a 71. Hadwin bogeyed his first hole before reeling off seven birdies. “Even the first two weeks back, I felt like I played some pretty decent golf. I just kind of made some rusty mistakes,” Hadwin said. “I’d hit a ball out of bounds or in the water where I shouldn’t have or maybe try to get too much out of a shot, whereas I think last week it kind of came together. I was doing a lot of the similar things, but I didn’t make any of the mistakes. I felt like there were times last week where I probably could have gotten a few more shots, but I really didn’t have any risk. It was kind of a free-flowing easy-type round and just not a lot of stress. When you can do that through multiple weeks, it helps a lot.” Taylor took time off as the tour restarted to be with his eight-month-old son. “Obviously the break was great timing for a lot of reasons ... Have a bit of a cushion, take some more time off, I just really enjoyed being home, so just waiting an extra few weeks, (it) was great to be home,” Taylor said. “Yeah, I’m excited to get back out here and play, but it was nice to be home.” Correction - July 10, 2020: This article was edited from a previous version that mistakenly said Adam Hadwin posted the highest score among Canadian golfers with a 6-under 66.

Expected to hit $1 trillion, the emerging Republican package shows shifting priorities as the pandemic crisis deepens nationwide. Once reluctant to approve more aid, Republicans and the White House now say more is needed. In recent days, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been reaching out to GOP senators ahead of negotiations with Democrats, who already approved a $3 trillion House bill. McConnell, during a visit to a hospital in his home state of Kentucky, said the theme of the upcoming GOP bill will be children and schools, jobs and unemployment, and health care. Congress is returning Monday for two weeks to consider fresh coronavirus relief as the Trump administration has been unable to halt the virus’ deepening spread across the country. Asked at an earlier event Tuesday if he would be attending next month’s Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, Florida, a state with record-setting cases, McConnell said his “current intention“ is to go, but that he would assess closer to the date. While McConnell wanted to hit “pause” after the last big relief package in May, he now hopes to swiftly approve the new one in hopes of staunching the pandemic crisis and economic fallout. Speaking at the White House, President Donald Trump said, “We have to get everything open.“ House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned that, without a comprehensive federal strategy for the country, the devastating virus and its economic toll will only persist. “We can open our economy, we can open our schools, if we test, trace, treat, separate, mask, hygiene and the rest, but we have to make a national decision to do it,” Pelosi said on CNN. Pelosi said she’s “very afraid of where we are now, because of the ignorance in the administration.” She warned that if Congress doesn’t make the investments needed, “we’re going to pay a worse price, worse hit, on the economy.” Central to the GOP proposal is a five-year liability shield that McConnell wants to extend to businesses, hospitals, schools and others to prevent lawsuits from those claiming injuries during the pandemic and economic shutdown and reopening. McConnell acknowledged schools will need more money, especially as they reduce class sizes for social distancing and potentially stagger classroom shifts. Democrats have proposed $100 billion for schools in the House-passed bill. This week, Vice-President Mike Pence assured governors on a private conference call that he was working with congressional leaders on securing more education funds. Some Trump advisers want a robust amount for schools, believing it would be politically popular and give the president a needed campaign boost ahead of the election. “I know they’re going to need help in order to keep the kids safely in schools,” McConnell said. “There’s a cost associated with that.” Republicans initially wanted to end a $600 weekly boost to unemployment insurance that’s set to expire at the end of this month. But McConnell said Tuesday that providing some unemployment insurance is “extremely important” for out-of-work Americans. The new bill will likely reconfigure the bonus, replacing it with a smaller amount. Additionally, Republicans are eyeing a return-to-work stipend for workers to get back on the job and another round of direct payments to Americans modeled on the the $1,200 rebates sent in spring. Republicans are also considering new tax breaks for companies that reconfigure offices and work spaces to protect returning employees from the coronavirus. Unclear is how much money Republicans are willing to provide states and cities pushing the federal government for relief. Also uncertain is what kind of resources McConnell plans to make available for virus testing, which many experts say is central to staunching the virus spread. House Democrats have proposed $75 billion toward a new national testing strategy in their bill. With the federal deficit hitting a historic high in June, Republicans are likely to object to big-ticket spending. McConnell acknowledges the new legislation is expected to run into resistances. Some expect as many as a dozen Republican senators could be opposed. As lawmakers debate what to include in the next COVID-19 bill, a range of interest groups have peppered Congress with requests. In a call Tuesday organized by a coalition of labour and health groups, actress Jane Fonda and other speakers urged lawmakers to include money for personal protective equipment, or PPE, for health care workers, as well as paid sick leave and a mandate for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to impose an emergency health standard for U.S. workplaces. Democrats and advocacy groups have accused the agency of being largely invisible during the pandemic and failing to protect workers at meatpacking plants, health care facilities and other high-risk sites. Instead of an emergency standard, the agency has relied on voluntary guidance that recommends companies take various steps to erect physical barriers, enforce social distancing and install more hand-sanitizing stations. The House Democrats’ bill mandates an emergency workplace standard. The lack of action “is disgraceful and an insult to family members” who have lost loved ones, said Jessica Martinez, co-executive director of the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, an advocacy group. Martinez said the next COVID-19 bill must include funds for personal protective equipment, paid sick leave and full medical coverage for essential workers, and the emergency OSHA standard. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report."

Water levels at major rivers were rising Tuesday at around two dozen points in 20 districts. Many new areas in northern, northeastern and central Bangladesh have been affected over last 24 hours, Arifuzzman Bhuiyan, an executive engineer with the Water Development Board, said by phone. Bangladesh has 64 districts. “The situation is worsening,“ he said. “The worst thing is that the floods are getting prolonged this year, which is a bad sign.” Bhuiyan said heavy rainfall and rushing waters from upstream India were the main reasons for the floods in the delta nation of 160 million people, which receives monsoon rains between June and October every year, often leading to flooding. The floods started late last month, and after briefly easing continued to worsen, affecting many new areas, destroying crops and driving people from their homes in several impoverished regions. Bangladesh is crisscrossed by 230 rivers, including 53 shared with India. In the northern district of Kurigram, one of the worst-hit areas, thousands of villagers have moved from their homes to higher ground since the weekend, bringing along their cattle and other belongings, said Mizanur Rahman Soikat, project co-ordinator with the Bidyanondo Foundation, a local charity. The foundation has been distributing both cooked and dry food to the flood-affected villagers, many of whom have lost their crops and livelihood. Soikat said that over the last few weeks, the charity has distributed food to some 135,000 people in Kurigram, while the government’s relief office was also providing food, cash and cattle food. “Over last two days, the situation has deteriorated and many villages went underwater in the district,“ he said by phone. “I have seen thousands taking shelter.” The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement Monday that more than a million Bangladeshis have been marooned by the floods, with the worst of it happening since the weekend. “Thousands of people are expected to leave their homes throughout the beginning of this week to seek shelter in higher ground as the Water Development Board warned that the onrush of water from upstream would further intensify,” the statement said. A.T.M. Akhteruzzman, a relief and rehabilitation officer in the northern district of Rangpur, said about 50,000 people who live along the Teesta River basin have been marooned. “Waters are coming from India, while heavy rainfalls in the region are causing havoc,” he said. “We are trying to do our best to stand by the people, as we have already provided more than 300 tons of rice, cattle food, baby food and a good amount of cash. Our relief operations will continue.“"

Wesley Ira Purkey, convicted of a gruesome 1998 kidnapping and killing, is scheduled for execution Wednesday at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, where Daniel Lewis Lee was put to death Tuesday after his own 11th-hour legal bids failed. Lee, who was convicted of killing an Arkansas family in a 1990s plot to build a whites-only nation, was the first of four condemned men scheduled to die in July and August despite the coronavirus pandemic raging both inside and outside prisons. Purkey, 68, of Lansing, Kansas, would be the second, but his lawyers were still expected to press for a ruling from the Supreme Court on his competency. “This competency issue is a very strong issue on paper,” said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. “The Supreme Court has halted executions on this issue in the past. At a minimum, the question of whether Purkey dies is going to go down to the last minute.” Lee’s own execution went forward a day late. It was scheduled for 4 p.m. Monday, but the Supreme Court only gave the green light in a narrow 5-4 ruling early Tuesday. The issue of Purkey’s mental health arose in the runup to his 2003 trial and when, after the verdict, jurors had to decide whether he should be put to death in the killing of 16-year-old Jennifer Long in Kansas City, Missouri. Prosecutors alleged that he raped and stabbed her, dismembered her with a chainsaw, burned her, then dumped her ashes 200 miles (320 kilometres) away in a septic pond in Kansas. Purkey was separately convicted and sentenced to life in the beating death of 80-year-old Mary Ruth Bales, of Kansas City, Kansas. But the legal questions of whether he was mentally fit to stand trial or to be sentenced to die are different from the question of whether he is mentally fit enough now, in the hours before his scheduled execution, to be put to death. Purkey’s lawyers argue he clearly is not, saying in recent filings that he suffers from advancing Alzheimer’s disease. “He has long accepted responsibility for the crime that put him on death row,” one of this lawyers, Rebecca Woodman, said. “But as his dementia has progressed, he no longer has a rational understanding of why the government plans to execute him.” Purkey believes his planned execution is part of a vast conspiracy involving his own attorneys, Woodman said. In other filings, they describe delusions that people were spraying poison into his room and that drug dealers implanted a device in his chest meant to kill him. While various legal issues in Purkey’s case have been hashed, rehashed and settled by courts over nearly two decades, the issue of mental fitness for execution can only be addressed once a date is set, according to Dunham, who also teaches law school courses on capital punishment. A date was only set last year. “Competency is something that is always in flux,” so judges can only assess it in the weeks or days before a firm execution date, he said. In a landmark 1986 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution prohibits putting someone to death who lacks a reasonable understanding of why he is being executed. It involved the case of Alvin Ford, who was convicted of murder but whose mental health deteriorated behind bars to the point where, according to his lawyer, he believed he was pope. Legal standards as to whether someone has a rational understanding of why an execution is taking place can be complex, Dunham explained. “I could say I was Napoleon,” he said. “But if I say I understand that Napoleon was sentenced to death for a crime and is being executed for it — that could allow the execution to go ahead.“ Purkey’s mental issues go beyond Alzheimer’s, his lawyers have said. They say he was subject to sexual and mental abuse as a child and, at 14, was diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and psychosis. Last week, three mental health organizations urged U.S. Attorney William Barr to stop Purkey’s execution and commute his sentence to life in prison without possibility of parole. The letter — signed by the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Mental Health America and the Treatment Advocacy Center — said that executing mentally ailing individuals like Purkey “constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and does not comport with ‘evolving standards of decency.’” The mother of the teen he killed, Glenda Lamont, told the Kansas City Star last year she planned to attend the execution. “I don’t want to say that I’m happy,” Lamont said. “At the same time, he is a crazy mad man that doesn’t deserve, in my opinion, to be breathing anymore.” The runup to Lee’s execution demonstrated that a lot can still happen before Purkey’s scheduled one. On Monday, hours before Lee was set to be put to death, a U.S. District Court judge put the execution on hold over concerns from death row inmates on how executions were to be carried out, and an appeals court upheld it, before the Supreme Court overturned it early Tuesday. If prison officials get the go-ahead to execute Purkey, he would be put to death by lethal injection, as Lee was, and in the same small room at the Terre Haute prison. ___ Hegeman reported from Wichita, Kansas.

The legislation and order are part of the Trump administration’s stepped-up offensive against China for what he calls the rising Asian superpower’s exploitation of America and its effort to conceal details about the human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus from the world. The almost daily administration attacks on Beijing come as Trump defends his own response to the virus, with cases surging in parts of the United States, and as he works ahead of the election to portray Biden as soft on China. “So Joe Biden and President Obama freely allowed China to pillage our factories, plunder our communities and steal our most precious secrets,” Trump said, adding, “I’ve stopped it largely.” Trump said that as vice-president, Biden advocated for the Paris Agreement addressing climate change; Trump withdrew the U.S. from the accord. “It would have crushed American manufacturers while allowing China to pollute the atmosphere with impunity, yet one more gift from Biden to the Chinese Communist Party,” Trump said. Trump talked up his own tough approach to Beijing, though he spent the early weeks of the pandemic praising Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two nations signed phase one of a trade deal, but since then, relations have soured and Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden that he has no interest in talking to Xi. The legislation Trump signed into law targets police units that have cracked down on Hong Kong protesters as well as Chinese Communist Party officials responsible for imposing a new, strict national security law widely seen as chipping away at Hong Kong’s autonomy. The mandatory sanctions are also required to be imposed on banks that conduct business with the officials. While he signed the bill into law, Trump issued a statement saying the administration would not view as binding certain sections of the law that the White House believes limit a president’s powers to conduct foreign policy. Lawmakers from both parties have urged Trump to take strong action in response to China’s new national security law that erodes the “one country, two systems” framework under which Britain handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997. Hong Kong is considered a special administrative region within China and has its own governing and economic systems. “This law gives my administration powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong’s freedom,” Trump said. “Their freedom has been taken away. Their rights have been taken away, and with it goes Hong Kong in my opinion because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets. A lot of people will be leaving Hong Kong, I suspect.“ The executive order he signed did not appear to go beyond his administration’s previous determinations that Hong Kong is no longer eligible for preferential treatment from the United States. Trump said the order strikes those privileges but, in fact, the administration already has been in the process of eliminating them for nearly two months. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo first made the determination in late May that China’s decision to impose a new national security law in Hong Kong meant the former British territory was no longer a democracy and so was no longer eligible for trade, commercial and other U.S. perks it had enjoyed. Just three days later, when Trump announced the U.S. was withdrawing from the World Health Organization because of Chinese influence, he echoed Pompeo’s determination and instructed his administration to immediately begin eliminating the preferences, which it did. In late June, the administration barred Hong Kong from importing U.S. weapons, saying its purchase of items that have both civilian and military applications would be subject to the same licensing requirements as mainland China. Other actions in the works include suspending an extradition treaty with Hong Kong, something Australia has already done, as well as ending legal co-operation agreements, taxation accords and financial understandings that cover accounting rules for Chinese businesses that work in the U.S. At the same time, the administration has pressed ahead with travel bans for Chinese, Hong Kong and communist party officials the U.S. believes are responsible for curtailing democracy in Hong Kong. The administration also also gone after China by imposing travel bans on officials for repressing minorities in western China and hindering foreigners’ access to Tibet. On Monday, Pompeo announced that the U.S. had decided to reject outright virtually all Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea, a determination that could lead to increased tensions in disputed, critical international shipping lanes. ___ Associated Press writer Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report."

In one interview, Trump seemed taken aback when asked why African Americans are still dying at the hands of police. “And so are white people. So are white people. What a terrible question to ask. So are white people,“ Trump told CBS’s Catherine Herridge. “More white people, by the way. More white people.” There is no national database tracking police-involved shootings. But studies have shown that Black Americans are much more likely to be killed by police, even though more whites — who make up a larger portion of the population — are killed. One study that examined the use of lethal force by law enforcement from 2009 to 2012, for instance, found that while victims were a majority white (52%), they were disproportionately Black (32%) with a fatality rate 2.8 times higher among Blacks than whites. Trump’s comments drew criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union’s Jeffery Robinson, who issued a harshly worded statement saying Trump’s answer “not only ignores the fact that per capita Black and Brown people are disproportionately killed by police, it provides the foundation for the dangerous and unconstitutional police practices that result in the deaths of Black people with regularity. “Trump’s racism is so absolute that he continues to refuse to give even a tacit acknowledgment to the epidemic of police violence against Black people in America,“ Robinson alleged, accusing Trump of ”using the violence and suffering perpetrated against Black communities as a white-supremacist dog whistle ahead of the coming election.” In the interview, Trump also defended the use of the Confederate flag, despite saying in 2015 that he believed the flag belongs in a museum. “All I say is freedom of speech. It’s very simple. My attitude is freedom of speech,“ Trump responded. ”Very simple. Like it, don’t like it, it’s freedom of speech.” Asked whether he understood the flag is a painful symbol to many because it is a reminder of slavery, Trump told CBS that some “people love it,” adding: “And I know people that like the Confederate flag and they’re not thinking about slavery.” Trump has been under fire for his response to the mass anti-racism protests that broke out across the across the nation following the killing of George Floyd in police custody. In the face of demands for racial justice and equality, Trump has instead leaned in on a law-and-order message, painting mostly peaceful protesters as domestic “terrorists” and continuing to stoke divisions. In a second interview with the conservative Townhall Media, Trump defended the white St. Louis couple captured on video brandishing guns as they defended their home during one racial injustice protest. Trump claimed that Mark and Patricia McCloskey “were going to be beat up badly, if they were lucky” and said their house would have been “totally ransacked and probably burned down” had they not been out there. “And now I understand somebody local, they want to prosecute these people. It’s a disgrace,” he said. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson told reporters that he spoke with Trump and U.S. Attorney General William Barr by phone earlier Tuesday and that the president expressed concern that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, a Democrat, may file charges against the couple. “I think the president didn’t like what he was seeing, and the way people are being treated,” Parson said, adding, “I think you’ll see some sort of actions.”"

That is an increase from last week, when officials initially said 26 legislators and 10 others had the highly contagious virus. Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the state health officer, had said the numbers could go up as more people received test results. Dobbs said Tuesday that two people from the Capitol were hospitalized, but he did not say who they are. Mississippi has the largest outbreak of COVID-19 among state legislators in the U.S., according to numbers tracked by The Associated Press. Legislators left the Mississippi Capitol on July 1, after being there through most of June. Some people in the building wore masks and kept distance from others as precautions against spreading the virus, but many did not. It was common to see people leaning in to talk to each other with their faces uncovered. People also crowded into elevators and committee meeting rooms, and legislators also sat shoulder-to-shoulder in the House and Senate. Legislators will need to return to the Capitol at some point to approve a budget for the state Department of Marine Resources and to decide whether to override Republican Gov.

But a top Navy official said it was too soon to say if the 23-year-old ship that is burning on opposite ends will be salvageable. Navy officials were able to inspect four main engineering rooms and found no major damage, and the external structure of the ship appears to be safe, said Rear Adm. Philip Sobeck, the commander of the strike group whose flagship is the USS Bonhomme Richard. But he cautioned at a briefing that there is still “a major fire inside“ being fought by hundreds of sailors who were focusing their efforts on two isolated spots near the stern and the bow of the ship. It was unclear if there were two distinct fires on board or if the area burning near the tail end was simply from the heat of a single large blaze, Sobeck said. It’s also unclear whether the amphibious assault ship that is akin to a mini-aircraft carrier can still be repaired. “We haven’t been inside the ship well enough to be able to get a full picture, and it’s just too early to tell,“ Sobeck said. The fire temperatures had reached up to 1,000 degrees (538 Celsius), causing the mast to collapse and threatening the central control island where the captain operates the vessel. In other good signs of progress, the fire had moved away from the one million gallons (3.8 million litres) of fuel on board, easing the risk of an explosion or spill, though the military was still taking precautions if either worst-case scenario should occur, he said. Helicopters had dumped 1,200 buckets of water on the ship, allowing crews to move further on board to fight the blaze. Tugboats were assisting from the waterline. The 840-foot (255-meter) ship was undergoing maintenance when the fire was first reported Sunday morning in a lower cargo area where seafaring tanks are parked. It appears to have started where cardboard boxes, rags and other maintenance supplies were being stored, Sobeck said. It spread rapidly from the front to the rear of the ship and quickly ballooned into one of the worst Navy shipyard fires in years. It could cost the military an estimated $4 billion to replace the ship. At least 61 people, including 38 sailors and 23 civilians, have been treated for heat exhaustion, smoke inhalation and minor injuries. None were in the hospital Tuesday. Maritime lawyer Rod Sullivan, who served in the Navy, said two separate fires on a ship is highly unusual and could raise questions as to whether arson was involved. “It is very, very difficult for fire to traverse the entire length of ship,“ and then to not cause damage in every compartment, said Sullivan, who has handled fire cases involving everything from large passenger ships to yachts. “Arson has to be considered as a possibility here.” Navy officials said they will conduct a thorough investigation, but they have no indications yet of any foul play. Sobeck said the fire appears to have travelled upward to an open hangar-like area and from there, fueled by oxygen, it raced along the ship’s ventilation and cables, causing it to traverse the ship. Cables and duct work being done as part of the ship’s maintenance fed the fire and later created barriers to sailors trying to fight it, Sobeck said. Also, at least two fire-suppression systems were not able to be used. One was deactivated while the ship was being worked on, and the other was not able to be launched because of an explosion — believed cause by pressure building up when the fire started, Sobeck said. ___ Associated Press writer John Antczak contributed from Los Angeles."

Mike Parson said President Donald Trump is focused on and concerned about the possibility that a white St. Louis couple could face criminal charges for displaying guns as they defended their home during a racial injustice protest. Parson told reporters Tuesday that he had just been on the phone with Trump and U.S. Attorney General William Barr. The phone call came amid reports that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, a Democrat, may file charges against Mark and Patricia McCloskey, both of them lawyers in their 60s. The couple wielded guns on June 28 as protesters marched by their Renaissance palazzo-style mansion on the way to the home of St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson. A police report said the couple heard a loud commotion and saw a large group of people break an iron gate marked with “No Trespassing” and “Private Street” signs. Video showed protesters walking through the gate and it was unclear when it was damaged. The widely viewed video showed Mark McCloskey wielding a long-barrelled gun and Patricia McCloskey standing next to him waving a handgun. The actions of the couple have drawn scorn and ridicule from some, praise and support from others. Gardner’s spokeswoman said Tuesday that the case is still under investigation and no charges have been filed, though authorities executed a search warrant at the mansion late last week. Parson, a Republican and a staunch Trump supporter, is also a former sheriff and state representative who co-authored Missouri’s “castle doctrine” law that justifies the use of deadly force when protecting one’s home. Parson said he told Trump that it’s difficult to remove an elected official from office in Missouri, though he didn’t say if Trump had asked if Gardner could be removed. “I think the president didn’t like what he was seeing, and the way people are being treated,” Parson said. “I think you’ll see some sort of actions.” In an interview Tuesday with Townhall Media, Trump defended the couple, saying “they were going to be beat up badly, if they were lucky” and that their house was going to be ransacked and probably burned. He called talk of prosecuting them a disgrace. It’s unclear what either Trump or Barr could do, but Parson said he expects that both “are going to take a look at it.” Gardner’s spokeswoman, Allison Hawk, said she was unaware of Parson’s comments and declined immediate comment. Gardner issued a statement after the confrontation saying her office was working with police to investigate it. “We must protect the right to peacefully protest, and any attempt to chill it through intimidation or threat of deadly force will not be tolerated,” she said at the time. Gardner became St. Louis’ first-ever Black circuit attorney when she took office after winning election in 2016. Her 3 1/2 years in office have drawn strong support from the Black community, especially for reform efforts aimed at reducing incarceration and stopping the prosecution of low-level crimes such as marijuana possession. But she’s also drawn scorn from others, accusing her of being weak on crime and motivated by politics. In 2018, Gardner charged then-Gov. Eric Greitens with felony invasion of privacy for allegedly taking a compromising photo of a woman during an extra-marital affair. Greitens, a Republican, denied the allegation and the charge was eventually dropped, but he resigned in June that year. St. Louis annually ranks among the nation’s deadliest cities, and 2020 is on pace for one of its deadliest years ever. Parson is planning a special session to address violent crime in St. Louis and Kansas City, and he said Gardner should be focused on crime, too, not the McCloskeys. “That couple had every right to protect their property,” Parson said. Trump “understands the situation in Missouri, he understands the situation in St. Louis, and how out of control it is for a prosecutor to let violent criminals off and not do their job and try to attack law-abiding citizens,“ Parson said. “The president said he would do everything he could within his powers to help with this situation, that he would be taking action to do that. I’m thankful that he’s getting involved in the situation, I’m thankful that he’s going to stand up for people on their legal rights and we’re going to move forward in this state,” Parson said."

The decision was announced at the start of a hearing in a federal lawsuit in Boston brought by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs said federal immigration authorities agreed to pull the July 6 directive and “return to the status quo.” A lawyer representing the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said only that the judge’s characterization was correct. The announcement brings relief to thousands of foreign students who had been at risk of being deported from the country, along with hundreds of universities that were scrambling to reassess their plans for the fall in light of the policy. With the policy rescinded, ICE will revert to a directive from March that suspended typical limits around online education for foreign students. ICE did not immediately comment on the decision. Harvard President Lawrence Bacow called it a “significant victory.” “While the government may attempt to issue a new directive, our legal arguments remain strong and the Court has retained jurisdiction, which would allow us to seek judicial relief immediately to protect our international students should the government again act unlawfully,” Bacow said in a statement. MIT’s president said his institution also stands ready “to protect our students from any further arbitrary policies.” “This case also made abundantly clear that real lives are at stake in these matters, with the potential for real harm,“ President L. Rafael Reif said in a statement. ”We need to approach policy making, especially now, with more humanity, more decency — not less.” Under the policy, international students in the U.S. would have been forbidden from taking all their courses online this fall. New visas would not have been issued to students at schools planning to provide all classes online, which includes Harvard. Students already in the U.S. would have faced deportation if they didn’t transfer schools or leave the country voluntarily. Even if an outbreak had forced colleges to move all their classes online during the semester, international students would have been forced to transfer to a school with campus instruction or leave the country. Immigration officials issued the policy last week, reversing the earlier guidance from March 13 telling colleges that limits around online education would be suspended during the pandemic. University leaders believed the rule was part of President Donald Trump’s effort to pressure the nation’s schools and colleges to reopen this fall even as new virus cases rise. The policy drew sharp backlash from higher education institutions, with more than 200 signing court briefs supporting the challenge by Harvard and MIT. Colleges said the policy would put students’ safety at risk and hurt schools financially. Many schools rely on tuition from international students, and some stood to lose millions of dollars in revenue if the rule had taken hold. Harvard and MIT were the first to contest the policy, but at least seven other federal suits had been filed by universities and states. The unexpected decision was welcome news to students across the nation who had been on edge. “I feel relief,” said Andrea Calderon, a 29-year-old biology graduate student from Ecuador. “It would have been a very big problem if I had to leave the country right now.” The City College of New York student said returning home would have made it much harder to finish her thesis and pursue a Ph.D. Internet access at home in Ecuador is spotty, she said, and going through the process to come back to the U.S. in the future would be too expensive. Rahul Lobo, 19, from Goa on the west coast of India, said he feels “an immeasurable amount of relief.” “As it is, we’re living in very uncertain times, and the recent ICE policy just made things even more uncertain,” said Lobo, a rising junior at the University of Notre Dame. “Suddenly I wasn’t worrying about whether I could get back to campus, but more whether I would even be able to finish my degree in four years.“ The American Council on Education, which represents university presidents, applauded ICE’s pullback of the rule. The group called the policy “wrongheaded” and said it drew unprecedented opposition from colleges. “There has never been a case where so many institutions sued the federal government,” said Terry Hartle, the group’s senior vice-president. “In this case, the government didn’t even try to defend its policymaking.” Many opponents, however, were hesitant to call it a closed case. Massachusetts’ Democratic attorney general, who is leading a separate lawsuit against the policy, warned that the Trump administration may attempt again to impose limits on international students. “This is why we sue. The rule was illegal and the Trump Administration knew they didn’t have a chance,” Maura Healey said on Twitter. “They may try this again. We will be ready.” Harvard and MIT argued that immigration officials violated procedural rules by issuing the guidance without justification and without allowing the public to respond. They also argued that the policy contradicted ICE’s March 13 directive telling schools that existing limits on online education would be suspended “for the duration of the emergency.” The suit noted that Trump’s national emergency declaration has not been rescinded and that virus cases are spiking in some regions. Immigration officials, however, argued that they told colleges all along that any guidance prompted by the pandemic was subject to change. They said the rule was consistent with existing law barring international students from taking classes entirely online. Federal officials said they were providing leniency by allowing students to keep their visas even if they study online from abroad. ___ AP reporters Carolyn Thompson in Buffalo and Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report."

The court said that the 87-year-old Ginsburg went to a hospital in Washington on Monday evening after experiencing fever and chills. She then underwent a procedure at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore on Tuesday afternoon to clean out a bile duct stent that was placed last August when she was treated for a cancerous tumour on her pancreas. The statement said the justice “is resting comfortably and will stay in the hospital for a few days to receive intravenous antibiotic treatment.” Ginsburg spent a night in the hospital in May with an infection caused by a gallstone. While in the hospital, she participated in arguments the court heard by telephone because of the coronavirus pandemic. Ginsburg, who was appointed by former U.S. president Bill Clinton and joined the court in 1993, has been treated four times for cancer. In addition to the tumour on her pancreas last year, she was previously treated for colorectal cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009. She had lung surgery to remove cancerous growths in December 2018. Speaking at a news conference in the Rose Garden on Tuesday evening, President Donald Trump was asked about Ginsburg. He said he hadn’t heard she had been hospitalized. “I wish her the best. I hope she’s better,“ he said."

The marble statue of a saluting Confederate soldier was taken to a Civil War cemetery in a secluded area of campus. Students and faculty have pushed the university for years to move the statue, but they have said in recent weeks that their work was being undermined by administrators’ plan to beautify the cemetery — a plan that critics said could create a Confederate shrine. A draft plan by the university indicated that the burial ground will have a lighted pathway to the statue. It also said headstones might be added to Confederate soldiers’ graves that have been unmarked for decades. Ole Miss Chancellor Glenn Boyce said Tuesday that the plan for headstones was being abandoned. Boyce said a recent survey with ground-penetrating radar showed that bodies are buried close to the surface. “I feel excavating within the walls of the cemetery presents a significant risk of disturbing remains,” Boyce said in a statement. “This is a risk I am not prepared nor willing to take.” The University of Mississippi was founded in 1848, and the statue of the soldier was put up in 1906 — one of many Confederate monuments erected across the South more than a century ago. Critics say the statue’s location near the university’s main administrative building has sent a signal that Ole Miss glorifies the Confederacy and glosses over the South’s history of slavery. The state College Board on June 18 approved a plan to move the monument. The decision happened amid widespread debate over Confederate symbols as people across the U.S. and in other countries loudly marched through the streets to protest racism and police violence against African Americans. The statue at Ole Miss was a gathering point in 1962 for people who rioted to oppose court-ordered integration of the university. In February 2019, a rally by outside pro-Confederate groups at the monument prompted Ole Miss basketball players to kneel in protest during the national anthem at a game later that day. Student government leaders voted two weeks later for a resolution asking administrators to move the monument to the cemetery, where Confederate soldiers killed at the Battle of Shiloh are buried. One of the student senators sponsoring that resolution was Arielle Hudson of Tunica, Mississippi, who graduated this year and has been selected as a Rhodes scholar. She said Thursday that her joy at knowing the statue was moved was tempered by concerns about the university’s elaborate cemetery plan. Hudson said she was pleased to hear that Boyce abandoned the headstone plan but she wishes he had done it without having to be pressured by hundreds of students, faculty members and alumni. As a student, Hudson gave tours to prospective students through an “ambassador” program. She said ambassadors were generally told to avoid the Confederate statue, but she once ended up near it. “Those conversations were hard, especially as a Black student trying to convince other Black students and their families that they belong here,“ Hudson said Thursday. ”You’re standing a few feet away from an object that tells them that space wasn’t made for them.” The University of Mississippi has worked for more than 20 years to distance itself from Confederate imagery, often amid resistance from tradition-bound donors and alumni. The nickname for athletic teams remains the Rebels, but the university retired its Colonel Reb mascot in 2003 amid criticism that the bearded old man looked like a plantation owner. In 1997, administrators banned sticks in the football stadium, which largely stopped people from waving Confederate battle flags. The marching band no longer plays “Dixie.” Because of a student-led effort, the university in 2015 stopped flying the Confederate-themed Mississippi flag. A groundswell of support from business, religious, education and sports leaders recently pushed legislators to retire the flag. Since 2016, the university has installed plaques to provide historical context about the Confederate monument and about slaves who built some campus buildings before the Civil War. A plaque installed at the base of the Confederate statue said such monuments were built across the South decades after the Civil War, at a time when aging Confederate veterans were dying. “These monuments were often used to promote an ideology known as the ‘Lost Cause,’ which claimed that the Confederacy had been established to defend states’ rights and that slavery was not the principal cause of the Civil War,” the plaque says. “Although the monument was created to honour the sacrifice of Confederate soldiers, it must also remind us that the defeat of the Confederacy actually meant freedom for millions of people.” ___ Follow Emily Wagster Pettus on Twittter at http://twitter.com/EWagsterPettus.

The shooting occurred in Eaton County, southwest of Lansing, about 30 minutes after the stabbing at a Quality Dairy store, state police Lt. Brian Oleksyk said. A sheriff’s deputy spotted the man’s vehicle in a residential neighbourhood and shot him when he got out of his car and tried to attack her, Oleksyk said. “Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon!” the officer, a 22-year veteran, demanded, according to neighbourhood security video released by police. The man, Sean Ruis, was holding a screwdriver and knives, Eaton County Sheriff Tom Reich said. “It’s very unfortunate she had to use her weapon, but she had to save her life,” Reich said. “She had to use deadly force. She did it properly.” Ruis, 43, of Grand Ledge, who worked at the Michigan Department of Transportation, died at a hospital. He was suspected of stabbing a 77-year-old man inside the store when he was confronted about not wearing a mask, Oleksyk said. The stabbing victim was in stable condition at a hospital. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has ordered people to wear masks in stores to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus. “The goal here is to be safe. We all have to do our part so this doesn’t spread,” Reich said. The decision about whether to wear a mask in public for some has become a political statement, and there have been other violent encounters. In May, a security guard at a Family Dollar store in Flint was fatally shot after denying entry to a customer without a mask. Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, a Republican, said masks are important. But he also urged the general public not to confront people over a lack of a mask. “There is no reason to risk your health or your life over the debate of wearing masks in public,” Shirkey said. ___ Follow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwhiteap "

The Seward City Council voted Monday to raze the Jesse Lee Home, once a Methodist-run facility where orphans and other displaced children from Alaska Native villages were sent, many after the Spanish Flu epidemic of a century ago. The home’s most famous resident was Benny Benson, a 13-year-old Aleut who won a territory-wide contest in 1927 with his flag design — seven gold stars forming the Big Dipper, pointing to the larger golden North Star, all on a field of blue. The design became the state flag after Alaska was admitted into the union in 1959. Benson is believed to be the only Indigenous person to design a state flag. “Seward is being painted in a light that we don’t respect our history,” Seward Mayor Christy Terry said before the council voted to spend a $1 million state grant for demolition. “We have the opportunity to preserve the history and the legacy of a very important structure to the Alaska people, but it doesn’t mean that we have to preserve the building,” she said. The plan is to raze the two remaining rundown buildings of the Jesse Lee Home and eventually build a memorial at the site with community input. Terry has said her idea would be to have a pavilion using some of the salvaged wood from the property along with storyboards detailing the history and historical importance of the home. She also envisions a playground after closing another one nearby so that space could be opened up for housing. The children’s home was moved to Seward from Unalaska and opened in 1925. It operated there until it was heavily damaged in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, and the children were moved to Anchorage in 1966. The Seward site sat unused for more than five decades, and efforts to revitalize the home by private and public groups sputtered over the years. “It’s a very sad outcome after many years of concerted effort and kind of lost opportunities, but I do respect their decision,” said Judy Bittner, who has worked with Seward many times on the Jesse Lee Home since she became the state historical preservation officer in 1984. More than 20 letters were read at the council meeting, many calling for the city to save the historical structure. “We’re definitely disappointed,” said Trish Neal, president of the Alaska Association for Historic Preservation, a group that hoped for a reprieve for the structure. “I think we made a great effort to show the council and the community that there are a lot of people out there who supported saving the building.” One resident said she will be happy to see the home gone. “The funds are available and there is opportunity to beautify the area while still respecting the Jesse Lee Home history,” Rhonda Hubbard wrote to the council. “We need to demolish this old building, a building that is beyond repair, serves only as a hazard and visual blight to Seward.” Hubbard said the community has “Jesse Lee Home fatigue, and it is important we not allow it to take up more of our time and energy.” Seward-born Jackie Pels, who now lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, is publisher of “Family After All: Alaska’s Jesse Lee Home.” “I’m wistful, but I think it’s the only sensible decision at this time of statewide economic pain worsened by pandemic,” Pels said in an email to The Associated Press. “The prospect of a ‘story pavilion’ on the site, commemorating the lives of hundreds of people as well as the birth of the beloved flag, is greatly appealing, and who better than Seward’s community of artists and historians to bring it about?” she said."

Okinawan officials on Sunday said most of the cases since early July were at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which is at the centre of a relocation dispute. Others were at Camp Hansen, Camp Kinser and Camp McTureous. On Tuesday, Kadena Air Base reported two positive cases. Combined with three cases at Kadena in March, the total among the U.S. service members on Okinawa is 100, officials said. “We have discovered a number of problems,” Defence Minister Taro Kono said. “We need to more strictly scrutinize the situation with the U.S. military in Japan.“ Kono said the problems were discovered after Japanese officials requested information from the U.S. military. He refused to give details, but said the problems exist at U.S. bases throughout Japan, not just on Okinawa. In a possible indication of one of the problems, Kono said Japanese officials are inspecting a hotel used by the U.S. military to house service members newly assigned to Okinawa from the U.S. while they undergo a 14-day self-quarantine. Okinawan officials and residents have raised concerns about whether adequate safety measures are in place at the hotel. Later Tuesday, officials said no infections or major problems were found at the hotel and those staying there are not allowed to go out during their two-week quarantine. Current hotel residents will move to facilities on base next week, while the hotel will then accommodate those leaving Okinawa. Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki has criticized the U.S. military for a lack of transparency regarding the coronavirus, saying it has caused concern among residents. Tamaki in telephone talks Saturday with Lt. Gen. H. Stacy Clardy, commander of III Marine Expeditionary Force, demanded the U.S. military increase transparency, improve disease prevention measures, stop sending personnel from the mainland U.S. to Okinawa and seal the bases. The U.S. military has told Okinawa that all infected people have been isolated and the bases are virtually under lockdown, officials said. “We are taking prudent measures to prevent further spread of COVID-19 and will continue to communicate with our force, our families, and our local communities about positive COVID-19 cases,” Kadena base said Tuesday on its Facebook page. Okinawa is home to more than half of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact. Residents have long been sensitive to U.S. base-related problems such as pollution, noise and crime. Okinawans also oppose a planned relocation of Futenma Air Base from its current site in a densely populated area in the south to a less populated area on the east coast, and instead want the facility removed entirely from the island. Outside the bases, Okinawa has reported only about 150 coronavirus cases. Nationwide, Japan has confirmed 20,000 cases including about 1,000 deaths. ___ Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi "

The agency co-ordinating Thailand’s coronavirus response also announced Tuesday it is rolling back regulations for admitting foreign visitors in order to tighten up procedures. The incidents involving newly arrived foreigners emerged after seven weeks during which Thailand’s only new confirmed cases of the coronavirus were from Thais repatriated from abroad, with no cases of local transmission reported. The government has been eager to begin the process of reopening the country to foreign visitors, especially tourists who are vital contributors to the economy. Anger was palpable in the eastern province of Rayong, where a member of a visiting 31-member Egyptian military team who tested positive for the disease apparently skirted regulations to go shopping with his colleagues. The second case involved the infected 9-year-old daughter of a foreign diplomat whose family returned from Sudan and stayed in their condominium in Bangkok. Taweesilp Visanuyothin, spokesperson for the government’s Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration, said a contact tracing app indicated that 1,882 people may have crossed paths with the infected Egyptian and urged them to self-isolate for 14 days and get tested as soon as possible. Seven people known to have had direct contact with the man have already been quarantined. Officials in Rayong closed several schools and a mall and sealed off part of the hotel where the Egyptians stayed. Long lines of people formed outside one of the two malls the Egyptians visited, where health authorities were offering free coronavirus tests. Medical personnel in two mobile ambulances administered nose swabs. “I come to this place quite often,” said Pattamaporn Wonggnam, a 28-year-old office worker, “When I heard the news, I was quite worried.” The incident apparently is the first to test the government’s Thai Chana contact tracing system, in which visitors to malls and other public places scan a QR code with their phones upon entry and exit. The government said it would send messages to those flagged as being at possible risk. Deputy Public Health Minister Satit Pitutecha confirmed at a news conference in Rayong that the infected Egyptian was part of a group that went shopping. He blamed them for not co-operating with rules guiding the isolation of foreign visitors. The COVID-19 centre on Monday revealed the details of the Egyptian military team’s stopovers at U-Tapao airport in Rayong. The group arrived in Thailand via the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan on the night of July 8 and flew to Chengdu in China and back on July 9. They were tested for the coronavirus on July 10 and that same day members of the group visited several public locations, including two malls, in Rayong. By the time the results of the infected man’s test were processed on July 11, the Egyptian team had departed for home. COVID-19 centre spokesman Taweesilp said Tuesday that landing permission is being revoked for eight Egyptian flights due to lack of co-operation from last week’s visiting military team. The Egyptian Embassy in Thailand released a statement Tuesday expressing “its most sincere regrets and sympathies” to all affected by the incident. It said it was working with the Thai authorities to mitigate any threat to public health, and offered assurances that its military crews follow strict health measures before embarking on flights. The entire team involved in the Rayong incident “had passed COVID-19 screening before initiation of travel,“ it said. Taweesilp, the Thai spokesperson, also said permission for three categories of foreign visitors who were recently allowed entry — VIP guests of the government, diplomats or representatives of international organizations, and businesspeople and investors and others on approved missions — was temporarily postponed pending a revamp of entry procedures. The latter group would be allowed to travel on special repatriation flights for Thais. In Rayong, a 68-year-old company manager expressed her distress over how the government handled the situation. “I am angry because this shouldn’t happen. They should have been quarantined, same as Thais who travel back who have to be quarantined for 14 days,” said Panpen Sakulkru. “Why did this group of people receive a privilege and was able to skip the quarantine?” A third revision of rules by announced by the COVID-19 centre will require arriving diplomats to stay in state-supervised quarantine for 14 days instead of self-isolating. That ruling was apparently in response to the case of the daughter of a diplomat from Sudan whose family travelled from their homeland on July 7 and reportedly tested negative for the coronavirus on arrival in Bangkok. However, the girl was retested after showing symptoms and was found to be positive. The family has been staying in a condominium in Bangkok which health authorities will now investigate for any spread of the disease. Diplomats, unlike ordinary foreigners entering Thailand, did not have to stay at state quarantine facilities, but the rules guiding their quarantine were not clearly spelled out. —— Associated Press writer Busaba Sivasomboon in Bangkok contributed to this report."

The report highlighting the government’s defence priorities was adopted by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Cabinet on Tuesday, less than a day after the Trump administration rejected outright nearly all of Beijing’s significant maritime claims in the South China Sea in a statement likely to deepen the U.S.-China rift. The Abe government’s Defence White Paper 2020 highlights what are potential Chinese and North Korean threats as Japan tries to further increase its defence capability. Under Abe, Japan has steadily increased its defence budget and capability and purchased costly American arsenals. Defence Minister Taro Kono recently scrapped the deployment of a pair of costly U.S. land-based missile intercepting systems due to technical issues, and Abe quickly announced his intention to revise Japan’s defence guidelines, possibly allowing Japan to go beyond its conventional defence-only role under the Japan-U.S. security alliance, including discussing a possibility of acquiring a preemptive strike capability. The White Paper accused China of using propaganda, including spreading disinformation, about the spread of the coronavirus. “The COVID-19 pandemic may expose and intensify strategic competition among countries intending to create international and regional orders more preferable to themselves and to expand their influence,” the report said. “We need to closely watch their move with serious concern affecting the national security.” As evidence, a Japanese Defence Ministry official noted that a Chinese Foreign Ministry official had posted on Twitter in March an accusation that the U.S. military had spread the coronavirus in Wuhan and that Chinese media have touted herbal medicine as effective COVID-19 treatments. He spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing department rules. The annual report said China has “relentlessly” pushed to “change the status quo” in the Asian seas, including sending 3,000-ton class government vessels into Japanese waters around Japan-controlled disputed East China Sea islands called Senkaku in Japanese. Beijing also claim the islands and call them Diaoyu. China is also pursuing its unilateral attempt in the South China Sea even more aggressively and even expanding its area of activity into more distant seas, a concern shared by the international community, the report said. The South China Sea problem “directly affects peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.” “As China now boasts its capability and makes attempts to unilaterally change the status quo in many places, we must closely grasp what China’s intentions are,” Kono told a news conference Tuesday. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that Japan’s defence paper is full of prejudice and false information against China, and that it tried its best to hype the so-called “China threat.” “China has always firmly maintained its sovereignty, security and development interests. All attack or discredit on China are futile,” Zhao said. He urged Japan to stop deliberately intensifying tensions and get along with China. The report also cited North Korea’s continued development of its nuclear and other weapons programs. The North is “relentlessly pursuing increasingly complex and diverse modes of attack and is steadily strengthening and improving its attack capabilities,“ the report said. It said North Korea since May 2019 has launched three types of new short-range ballistic missiles that use solid fuel and fly at lower altitudes than their conventional missiles that can breach Japanese missile defence system. As Japan’s relations with South Korea have plunged to their lowest levels recently over wartime history, export control and territorial issues, the report prompted Seoul to protest Japan’s claims over a set of small South Korea-controlled islets between the countries. The report mentions the islands as part of Japanese territories that remain unresolved. Foreign ministry spokesman Kim In-chul issued a statement urging Tokyo to “immediately” remove such claims from the report, saying that the islets called Dokdo in the Koreas and Takeshima in Japan are South Korean territory by international law. ___ Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, and researcher Liu Zheng in Beijing contributed to this report. ___ Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi "

China accused the U.S. on Tuesday of trying to sow discord between China and the Southeast Asian countries with which it has long-standing territorial disputes in waters that are both a vital international shipping lane and home to valuable fisheries. “The United States is not a country directly involved in the disputes. However, it has kept interfering in the issue,” the Chinese Embassy in Washington said on its website. “Under the pretext of preserving stability, it is flexing muscles, stirring up tension and inciting confrontation in the region.” Other governments avoided direct comment on the U.S. announcement. The Philippine presidential spokesperson, Harry Roque, noted that the two powers would woo his country as they escalate their rivalry, but “what is important now is to prioritize the implementation and crafting of a code of conduct to prevent tension in that area.” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a statement released Monday, said the U.S. now regards virtually all Chinese maritime claims outside its internationally recognized waters to be illegitimate. The new position does not cover land features above sea level, which are considered to be “territorial” in nature. Previously, the U.S. had only insisted that maritime disputes between China and its smaller neighbours be resolved peacefully through U.N.-backed arbitration. Pompeo’s statement was a major shift in America’s South China Sea policy, said Zhu Feng, the director of a South China Sea studies centre at Nanjing University. He said other countries challenging China’s claims may take a more aggressive stance because of America’s openly stated support. “The U.S. didn’t use to comment on the sovereignty issue in the South China Sea, because it itself is not a claimant,” Zhu said. “But this time it has made itself into a judge or arbiter. It will bring new instability and tension.” He advised against a strong response from China, saying that current U.S. policy is being driven in a significant way by President Donald Trump’s reelection considerations. “Trump’s current China policy is insane,” Zhu said. “He is making the China issue the most important topic for his election to cover his failure in preventing the epidemic and to divert public attention. I have no idea how far he will go in fully utilizing the China issue.” An Indonesian analyst agreed that the announcement was a political one to divert attention from Trump’s weaknesses at home. A.A. Banyu Perwita, an international relations professor at President University, predicted it would focus more attention on the Indo-Pacific corridor but not have dramatic consequences. “It will be not more than a political diplomatic statement,“ he said, adding that ”we need to make the atmosphere calm now. The best position for all now is the current status quo.” James Chin, head of the Asia Institute at the University of Tasmania in Australia, said the U.S. stance was nothing new because it has always rejected China’s “nine-dash line,” as its claim to the South China Sea is known. “What is new is that Trump has sort of made the South China Sea a new focus point for his confrontation with China,” he said. Both Indonesia and the Philippines joined Pompeo in calling on China to abide by an international arbitration court ruling in 2016 that disqualified many of China’s claims. Malaysia’s foreign ministry declined to comment. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian reiterated China’s position that it has had effective jurisdiction over the islands, reefs and waters of the South China Sea for more than 1,000 years. He said at a daily briefing Tuesday that China is not seeking to build a maritime empire. China’s emergence as a military power and its ambitions to extend its offshore reach have come into conflict with the U.S., which has been the dominant naval power in the western Pacific in the post-World War II period. Two U.S. aircraft carriers drilled together in the South China Sea last week in a show of force. Zhao, in a lengthy response to Pompeo’s statement, criticized America’s frequent dispatch of “large-scale advanced military vessels and aircraft” to the waters. “The U.S. is indeed a troublemaker that undermines regional peace and stability,“ he said. ___ Associated Press researcher Yu Bing in Beijing and writers Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines, Edna Tarigan in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, contributed to this report."

The 28,498 cases reported in the past 24 hours took the national total to 906,752. Cases have jumped by 100,000 in four days. The Health Ministry also reported another 553 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking total fatalities up to 23,727. India has largely lifted its nationwide lockdown, and the virus has been spreading at a significant rate, prompting several big cities to impose partial lockdowns. The southern city of Pune started a 10-day lockdown Tuesday in an attempt to break the chain of infections. Only essentials including milk shops, pharmacies, doctors’ clinics and emergency services will be allowed open. Eight of India’s 28 states, including the worst-hit Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and New Delhi, account for nearly 90% of cases. India is the third worst-affected country in terms of infections, only behind the United States and Brazil. In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region: — Authorities in Thailand are urging nearly 1,900 people to quarantine themselves and get tested for the coronavirus after a breakdown in screening allowed two foreigners with the disease to pose a risk to public health. The agency co-ordinating Thailand’s coronavirus response also announced it is tightening regulations that had allowed the entry of some foreign visitors. Taweesilp Visanuyothin, spokesman for the Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration, said a contract tracing app showed that 1,882 people may have crossed paths with an infected member of a visiting Egyptian military team. He asked them to self-isolate for 14 days and get tested as soon as possible. Seven people already known to have had direct contact with the Egyptian have already been quarantined. Officials in the eastern province of Rayong closed several schools and a mall, sealed off part of the hotel where the Egyptians stayed and gave free coronavirus tests to people who feared they had contact with the infected man. The second case involves the infected 9-year-old daughter of a foreign diplomat whose family returned from Sudan and stayed in their condominium in Bangkok. — Australia’s Queensland state is toughening the punishment for those who break coronavirus quarantine rules. Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the current fines for breaking a mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine for some visitors or lying about their whereabouts may not be a sufficient penalty. The maximum penalty will now be a higher fine or up to six months’ imprisonment. Queensland reopened its borders to all but Victoria state residents two weeks ago. Victoria is the centre of Australia’s recent outbreak, adding 270 new infections overnight to its more than 4,000 active cases. The Victorian city of Melbourne is under a six-week lockdown to try to contain the outbreak. — South Korea reported 33 new cases of COVID-19 as its prime minister called for vigilance ahead of the summer holiday season. The figures announced by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention brought the caseload to 13,512 cases, including 289 deaths. Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun urged people to avoid crowded areas, maintain distance with others and wear masks as they travel to beaches and other areas during the holiday season. — China said the number of people in treatment for COVID-19 in the country has fallen to just 297, with only three new cases of coronarvirus reported, all brought from outside the country. No new deaths were announced, leaving the total at 4,634 out of 83,605 cases of the disease. A pair of experts from the World Health Organization were in China on Monday to make arrangements for an investigation into how the pandemic may have spread after the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year."

The anti-polio campaign would last three days, from next Monday, with the plan to have about 800,000 children vaccinated, the officials said. Police departments have received requests to ensure the safety of the polio workers. Rana Mohammad Safdar, who oversees anti-polio operations in the country, said polio workers would adhere to social distancing regulations while carrying out their duty. The announcement comes after Pakistan’s powerful army chief, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, told Microsoft co-founder and billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates last month that despite the challenge of COVID-19, the government planned to restart polio vaccinations across the country. Bajwa gave no date at the time. Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria are the three countries in the world where polio — a disabling and life-threatening disease caused by the polio virus — is still endemic. The non-profit Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has helped Pakistan and other places worldwide fight the disease. The World Health Organization at a meeting in June reviewed the polio situation in Pakistan and elsewhere and extended travel restrictions, initially enforced in 2014, that require people to get vaccinated against polio a month before travelling to Pakistan. Pakistan had hoped to eliminate the disease by 2018, when only 12 cases were reported. But there was a surge in new cases the following year. Since January, Pakistan has reported 58 new polio cases from various parts of the country, including the northwestern region bordering Afghanistan. The Taliban and other militants regularly stage attacks on polio teams and security forces escorting them,a s well as vaccination centres and health workers because they claim the anti-polio drive is part of an alleged Western conspiracy to sterilize children or collect intelligence. The attacks on polio teams increased after it was revealed that a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign was used as a ruse by the CIA in the hunt for al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos in 2011 in Pakistan. Pakistan has had more than 253,000 cases of the coronavirus, including 5,320 deaths, since the first infection was detected in February. On Tuesday, it reported 1,979 cases — a substantial decrease in daily infections since May, when the lockdown was eased, causing a surge in COVID-19 infections and deaths."

Last week, Turkey cancelled the sixth-century former cathedral-turned-mosque’s 86-year status as a museum and said it would open for Muslim worship as of July 24. The decision sparked criticism in the United States, Greece, and other Western countries as well as from Orthodox Christian leaders. Pope Francis expressed sadness over the move. EU foreign ministers, holding their first face-to-face meeting in months on Monday, declared that they “condemned” the decision. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said there was “broad support to call on the Turkish authorities to urgently consider and reverse this decision.” Asked to comment on the EU criticism, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a joint news conference with his visiting Maltese counterpart: “We reject the word ‘condemnation.’“ “This is a matter that concerns Turkey’s sovereign rights,” he said. He argued that there were several mosques in EU-member Spain that had been converted into churches. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, meanwhile, described the 1934 decision by the Turkish Republic’s secular, founding leaders that converted Hagia Sofia from a mosque into a museum as a mistake. “We are rectifying a mistake. It’s as simple as that,” Erdogan said in a televised address, following a weekly Cabinet meeting. Erdogan maintained that the criticisms levelled against Turkey over Hagia Sophia’s return to a mosque were a “pretext” for enmity toward Turkey and Islam. He also said his country was determined to preserve the structure’s qualities as a cultural heritage. On Tuesday, Greece again expressed dismay at Turkey’s decision. “This decision is certainly painful to us as Greek Orthodox Christians but it also hurts us as citizens of the world,” said Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. “This is not a Greek-Turkish issue, it is not even a Euro-Turkish issue, it is global. It is a universal issue.” Mitsotakis added: “With this setback, Turkey is choosing to sever ties with the Western world and its values. It abandons a cultural direction of many centuries, preferring introversion. And it wraps with an artificial mantle of strength over its weakness.” Meanwhile, officials from Turkey’s religious affairs authority, said the landmark structure can remain open to visitors outside of prayer hours, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. The Christian depictions inside are no obstacle to Muslim prayers, said the officials who are preparing the site for Muslim worship. They added however, that the figures would need to be covered with curtains or through other means during the prayers, in line with Islamic traditions that prohibit such representations."

The setback sunk modest hopes that the three countries could resolve their differences and ink an agreement before Ethiopia begins to fill its $4.6 billion hydroelectric dam. Ethiopia had previously pledged to start filling the reservoir, even without a deal over its operation, at the start of the wet season in July, when rains flood the Blue Nile. A declared window of two to three weeks to resolve the dispute is closing fast. To Ethiopia, the colossal dam offers a critical opportunity to pull millions of citizens out of poverty and become a major power exporter. To downstream Egypt, which depends on the Nile River to supply its farmers and booming population of 100 million with fresh water, the dam poses an existential threat. Years of talks with a variety of mediators, including the Trump administration, have failed to produce a solution. Last week’s round, mediated by the African Union and observed by American and European officials, proved no different. Filling the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam without a deal would sharply escalate tensions in the bitter dispute. Experts fear it could push the countries to the brink of military conflict. “All of the efforts exerted to reach a solution didn’t come to any kind of result,” said Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukry Monday in an interview with Egypt’s DMC TV channel. Shukry warned Egypt may be compelled to appeal again to the U.N. Security Council to intervene in the dispute, a prospect Ethiopia rejects, preferring regional bodies like the A.U. to mediate. “If there is something that threatens the regional security of Egypt and international security, it is the main responsibility of the Security Council to adopt procedures that will prevent this,” he said. Meanwhile the countries agreed they would send their reports to the president of the African Union, and reconvene in a week to determine next steps. There was no immediate comment from Ethiopia on the latest round of talks. Between Egypt and Ethiopia lies Sudan, literally and figuratively. The African country stands to benefit from Ethiopia’s project through access to cheap electricity and reduced flooding, but it has also raised fears over the dam’s operation, which could endanger its own smaller dams, depending on the amount of water discharged daily downstream. In a press conference on Monday, Sudanese Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas explained a series of sticking points. While the parties were “keen to find a solution,” technical and legal disagreements persist over its filling and operation, he said. Most important, he said, are the unresolved questions of how much water Ethiopia will release downstream if a multi-year drought occurs, and how the countries will resolve any future disputes. Hisham Kahin, a member of Sudan’s legal committee in the dam negotiations, said 70%-80% of negotiations turned on the thorny question of whether an agreement would be legally binding. Ethiopia, he said, fears a binding agreement will hinder its future development projects. Sudan and Egypt consider it critical. “All suggestions are under discussion,” said Kahin. “We have made very little progress.”"

The international lender expects an overall economic contraction of 7.3% in Mideast oil exporting countries this year due to hits from the coronavirus outbreak and oil market turmoil. The contraction is 2% greater than the IMF’s initial projections in mid-April. “We are in a year like no other and therefore developments are very fast and coping with them is challenging for everyone,” Jihad Azour, director of the IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia department, told The Associated Press. The IMF had projected in April that Saudi Arabia’s economy would contract by about 2.3% this year. It has since revised that figure downward, saying the kingdom stands to see economic growth shrink by 6.8% before climbing to around 3% growth next year. In addition to lower crude prices and cuts to production, Saudi Arabia stands to lose billions of dollars in revenue because the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca is suspended due to the pandemic. For the first time in Saudi history, the hajj pilgrimage this month, which drew 2.5 million people last year, will not include pilgrims from outside the kingdom. To raise state revenue, Saudi Arabia tripled taxes on basic goods and services this month, increasing value-added tax to 15%. While the IMF has for years been urging Gulf states to introduce tougher austerity measures, “we did not recommend the specific measure here” for Saudi Arabia, Azour said. He said the IMF’s overall recommendation now is that governments that can afford to do so should consider the risks of a second wave of coronavirus and introduce measures that shore up the economy and protect the livelihoods of people. Meanwhile, oil-importing Mideast countries, which include Egypt, Jordan and Sudan, are expected to see an overall economic contraction of 1.1%, nearly unchanged from the IMF’s April projections. The overall level of inflation in these countries, however, is expected to reach 10%. There are massive challenges across the region, including in Lebanon, where inflation has mushroomed to 56% over the past year and where the currency has lost nearly two-thirds of its value. The most current IMF forecast predicts a 12% economic contraction this year in the small Mediterranean country, which hosts large populations of Syrian and Palestinian refugees. The IMF has held more than a dozen meetings with Lebanese authorities over a $10 billion loan request. The IMF says it is still working to assess the country’s financial losses as different arms of the government offer diverging figures. Additionally, Iran is struggling to manage the outbreak of the virus there as officials refuse to impose lockdown measures that would further rattle its economy battered by U.S. sanctions. In a sign of just how dire the economic situation has become, Iran requested a $5 billion loan from the IMF this year — the first such request made by the country in nearly six decades. Azour said the IMF continues to look into Iran’s loan request, which the Trump administration has publicly opposed. “This (coronavirus) crisis highlighted the vulnerabilities that exist in the system,” Azour said, especially in countries where there are high levels of informal workers and youth unemployment. “We are calling for revamping social protection, improving access to social services, and also increasing the level of financial inclusion to help and support those who are vulnerable,” he said. Since the start of the year, the IMF has approved about $17 billion in emergency loans to countries in the Middle East and the wider region, including $5.2 billion for Egypt and nearly $1.4 billion for Pakistan."

The case, brought by Amnesty International in January, called on the court to prevent NSO from selling its technology abroad, especially to repressive regimes. The Tel Aviv District Court ruled that Amnesty’s attorneys did not provide sufficient evidence “to prove the claim that an attempt was made to track a human rights activist by trying to hack his cellphone” or that the hacking was done by NSO. “Granting a license is done after the most rigorous process and also after granting the permit, the authority conducts oversight and close inspection, as necessary,” the court said. If human rights are found to be violated, that permit can be suspended or cancelled, it added. The court issued its ruling on Sunday, but only made it public on Monday. Gil Naveh, spokesman for Amnesty International Israel, said the group was disappointed but not surprised. “It’s been a longstanding tradition for the Israeli courts to be a rubber stamp for the Israeli Ministry of Defence,” he said. The group doesn’t know what evidence NSO or the Defence Ministry gave to the court, because the hearings were closed. “Even if we knew, we were not able to talk about it,” he said. In 2018, Amnesty claimed one of its employees was targeted by NSO’s malware, saying a hacker tried to break into the staffer’s smartphone, using a WhatsApp message about a protest in front of the Saudi Embassy in Washington as bait. NSO, an Israeli hacker-for-hire company, uses its Pegasus spyware to take control of a phone, its cameras and microphones, and mine the user’s personal data. The company has been accused of selling its surveillance software to repressive governments that use it against dissidents. It doesn’t disclose clients, but they are believed to include Middle Eastern and Latin American states. The company says it sells its technology to Israeli-approved governments to help them combat criminals and terrorism. NSO Group said in a statement that the company “will continue to work to provide technology to states and intelligence organizations,“ adding that its purpose is to ”save human lives.” In a report published last month, Amnesty International said Moroccan journalist Omar Radi’s phone was tapped using NSO’s technology as part of the government’s efforts to clamp down on dissent. A Saudi dissident has accused NSO of involvement in Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s killing in 2018."

The report released late Saturday by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization comes months after the Jan. 8 crash near Tehran killed 55 Canadian citizens, 30 permanent residents and dozens more with ties to Canada. Authorities had initially denied responsibility, only changing course days later after Western nations presented extensive evidence that Iran had shot down the plane. The report may signal a new phase in the investigation into the crash, as the aircraft’s black box flight recorder is due to be sent to Paris, where international investigators will finally be able to examine it. The flight was on the first leg of a trip to Canada via Kyiv, Ukraine at the time. The shootdown happened the same night Iran launched a ballistic missile attack targeting U.S. soldiers in Iraq, its response to the American drone strike that killed Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Jan. 3. At the time, Iranian troops were bracing for a U.S. counterstrike and appear to have mistaken the plane for a missile. The civil aviation report does not acknowledge that, only saying a change in the “alertness level of Iran’s air defence” allowed previously scheduled air traffic to resume. The report detailed a series of moments where the shootdown of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 could have been avoided. The report said the surface-to-air missile battery that targeted the Boeing 737-800 had been relocated and was not properly reoriented. Those manning the missile battery could not communicate with their command centre, they misidentified the civilian flight as a threat and opened fire twice without getting approval from ranking officials, the report said. “If each had not arisen, the aircraft would not have been targeted,” the report said. Western intelligence officials and analysts believe Iran shot down the aircraft with a Russian-made Tor system, known to NATO as the SA-15. In 2007, Iran took the delivery of 29 Tor M1 units from Russia under a contract worth an estimated $700 million. The system is mounted on a tracked vehicle and carries a radar and a pack of eight missiles. The report did not say why the Guard moved the air defence system, though that area near the airport is believed to be home to both regular military and bases of the paramilitary Guard. The report notes that the Ukrainian flight had done nothing out of the ordinary up until the missile launch, with its transponder and other data being broadcast. “At the time of firing the first missile, the aircraft was flying at a normal altitude and trajectory,” the report said. The plane had just taken off from Imam Khomeini International Airport when the first missile exploded, possibly damaging its radio equipment, the report said. The second missile likely directly struck the aircraft, as videos that night show the plane exploding into a ball of fire before crashing into a playground and farmland on the outskirts of Tehran. The report put the blame entirely on the crew of the missile battery. Already, six people believed to be involved in the incident have been arrested, judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili reportedly said in June. He said at the time three had been released on bail while the other three remained held. In recent months, Iran has repeatedly delayed releasing the aircraft’s so-called black box, which includes data and communications from the cockpit leading up to the shootdown. The U.S., under international regulations, has a right to be part of the investigation as the plane involved was a Boeing. Iran is to send the black box to France on July 20, where Ukrainian and French experts are expected to examine it, Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency recently reported. Iranian officials did not have the equipment on hand to read data from the box. The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians — including many Iranians with dual citizenship — and 11 Ukrainians, according to officials. The route was popular with those travelling onward to Canada. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates."

In a regular Cabinet meeting on the coronavirus, Rouhani said the easiest way to fight the virus is to close off all activities. But “then people come and stage protests because of chaos, famine and problems,“ he said. Confirmed virus cases and deaths reached a record low in May after mass lockdowns were imposed in Iran. But since then, the numbers have spiked again, with officials saying a combination of improved testing and re-openings has driven the surge. Rouhani urged that ceremonies be held with a limited number of participants. Many experts blame an increase in virus-related deaths over the past week on wedding and funeral ceremonies with large crowds. Ali Reza Zali, the head of Tehran’s virus task force, in a letter to officials banned any conferences, festivals or exhibitions and limited participants in wedding and funeral ceremonies to 10. Earlier this week, Iran reported 221 fatalities in a 24-hour period, the highest single-day death toll. Rouhani’s remarks came as many experts urged a halt to business activities to stop the increase in virus related deaths that have exceeded 12,600 out of 255,117 confirmed cases. Iranian officials have been particularly eager to remove restrictions on its economy, already crippled by sanctions the U.S. imposed after the Trump administration’s 2018 withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement. A sharp rise in subsidized gasoline prices led to four days of unrest in cities and towns across Iran in November, which rights group Amnesty International said led to more than 300 people being killed in clashes with police and security forces. Tehran has yet to release any official statistics about the scale of the unrest, though in June the government acknowledged that the security forces shot and killed protesters and a lawmaker said that 230 people were killed in the anti-government protests."

Jaroslaw Kaczynski spoke a day after election official’s confirmed that Polish President Andrzej Duda narrowly won a second five-year term. Duda’s victory strengthens the hold on power of Kaczynski’s Law and Justice party, which backed the president’s reelection. During Duda’s runoff campaign against Warsaw’s liberal mayor, the ruling camp accused non-state and foreign media of hostility toward Duda and the party. In an interview with the state-owned PAP news agency Kaczynski said there was a “powerful media front inspired from the outside“ during the presidential campaign. He named a TV station in Poland that is owned by an American corporation. “The media in Poland should be Polish,” Kaczynski said. Kaczynski said he wants to see “balance in the media among the different options,” calling it a “condition of democracy.” He said there are policies the government could promote to accomplish that goal but vowed that “we will not do anything that would threaten media freedom.” “We cannot ban them from taking part, I believe, in campaigns that are inspired from the outside, from destroying some and ignoring others, from painting a totally false picture of Poland and of the world,“ he said. ”But we can take steps to have a situation in which there will be more of the media which sees the reality in a more realistic way than we have now.”"

Helge Braun, who has co-ordinated the country’s fight against the pandemic from the start, said the government is considering limiting travel in and out of areas that see a sudden, unexplained surge in COVID-19 cases. “Our measures are appropriate to preventing a second big wave,” Braun told The Associated Press during an interview at the Chancellery in Berlin. “But this requires us to stay the course, not get careless in our measures, and maintain our respect for the virus.” Germans have watched in horror as cases in the United States, Brazil and elsewhere surged long after Germany flattened its own curve of infections in April. The country of 83 million has reported slightly over 200,000 confirmed cases and 9,077 deaths from COVID-19 since the start of the outbreak; the rate of new infections now averages about three per 100,000 inhabitants a week. Braun attributed Germany’s relative success in part to swift action during the early stages of the pandemic. As a trained emergency room doctor, the 47-year-old said he was aware of the risks if hospitals became overwhelmed with cases. “It was a great concern of mine to prevent such a situation,” Braun told the AP. While other governments considered letting the virus sweep through the population to get the pandemic over with sooner, Germany never seriously toyed with the idea of ‘herd immunity.’ “Our conclusion was that unless one brings the infection under control very strongly, then it will tend to grow exponentially,” Braun said. “We discarded herd immunity as a political policy completely.” Social distancing measures and the wearing of face masks in stores and on public transit, which have become an issue of contention in Germany and elsewhere, will likely remain compulsory for the coming months, Braun said. “It’s a fact that the infections are so low precisely as a result of these measures,” he said. “That distancing was maintained, that there are hygiene plans, that masks are worn.” “These measures aren’t obsolete with low numbers,” Braun said. “Instead, we have to continue to maintain them in order to keep the infection numbers low.” The focus should instead be on reviving economic and social life despite those measures, he said. “Wearing masks is the smallest restriction one needs to accept to prevent infection.” Braun declined to comment directly on the escalating number of confirmed cases in the United States, but said his office was in constant contact with other governments to exchange best practices in fighting the pandemic. “The experience we always share is that restrictive measures, especially when it comes to leisure activity, are very, very effective,“ he said. ”That a broad testing strategy is very, very helpful, and that early isolation of clusters can be a way to prevent more widespread restrictions.” Braun also cited Japan’s approach of sealing off areas where there are new infection clusters, noting that similar moves would be possible in Germany, too, under rules the federal and state governments agreed to three months ago. A partial lockdown imposed on two German counties last month following an outbreak at a slaughterhouse caused anger and confusion among residents, who were told they would be turned away from some German regions unless they could produce evidence they recently tested negative for the coronavirus. Braun said that if the source of infection can’t be directly identified and interrupted “then of course it’s logical and also necessary to limit travel in an out of such especially affected areas.” Pressed on whether this could mean police roadblocks, he declined to elaborate. Asked about the idea later Tuesday during a visit to Bavaria, Merkel suggested it was preferable for people to have certainty about travel restrictions than to find themselves banned from some places but not from others. “It’s a proposal one should discuss and one that I would advocate,” she said. The idea of travel restrictions is likely to be sensitive given the country’s 40-year partition during which residents of communist East Germany were forbidden from freely going to the West. Braun, whose day job as Merkel’s chief of staff includes co-ordinating the government’s digital policy, also helped spearhead the development of a smartphone app to notify individuals who might have been exposed to someone with the virus. Germany’s Corona-Warn-App has been downloaded more than 15.5 million times since its launch last month. Germany, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency for the next six months, wants leaders meeting in Brussels later this week to agree on an unprecedented 500 billion euro ($569 billion) stimulus package to revive the bloc’s pandemic-hit economies. “That’s a strong signal of solidarity,“ said Braun. ”We want all European countries to get through the crisis well.” ___ Follow Frank Jordans on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter "

Skirmishes on the volatile border between the two South Caucasus nations began Sunday. Azerbaijan said it has lost 11 servicemen and one civilian in three days of fighting, and Armenia said four of its troops were killed Tuesday. The two neighbours in the South Caucasus have been locked in conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of Azerbaijan that has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a war there ended in 1994. International efforts to settle the conflict have stalled. Armenian and Azerbaijani forces have frequently engaged in clashes. The current skirmishes appear to mark the most serious spike in hostilities since 2016 when scores were killed in four days of fighting. The latest incident began Sunday when Armenian and Azerbaijani troops exchanged fire in the northern section of their border. Officials in both countries blamed each other for starting the fighting and said that sporadic shelling has continued. Azerbaijan’s Defence Ministry said two senior officers, Maj. Gen. Polad Hashimov and Col. Ilgar Mirzayev, were killed in fighting Tuesday along with five other servicemen. Armenian officials claimed that Azerbaijani drones launched an attack on the Tuvush province town of Berd, targeting civilian infrastructure. Defence Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said that one of Azerbaijani drones was downed. Stepanyan also charged that the Azerbaijani military used civilians as shields, placing artillery close to the village of Dondar Gushchu in the Tovuz district about 10 kilometres (six miles) from the border. “The Azerbaijani side has surrounded its own population with artillery batteries, making them a target, and then complained that the Armenian forces fired in that direction,” she said on Facebook where she posted images of the Azerbaijani artillery around the village. The Azerbaijani military denied losing a drone and in turn claimed that its forces shot down an Armenian drone and destroyed an Armenian artillery system along with its crew. As hostilities continued, Armenia also accused Azerbaijan of launching cyberattacks on Armenian government websites. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on Monday accused Azerbaijan of provoking the clashes and warned that it would “bear responsibility for the unpredictable consequences.” Azerbaijani President Ilhan Aliyev denounced what he described as “another provocation of Armenia” and vowed to protect Azerbaijan’s national territory. Turkey, which has close ethnic and cultural ties with Azerbaijan, has voiced strong support to Baku in the conflict. The United States and Russia, which co-chair the Minsk group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that has tried to negotiate a settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, have condemned the violence and called for restraint. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had separate calls with his counterparts in Armenia and Azerbaijan on Monday to call for an immediate ceasefire. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Tuesday that Moscow was “deeply worried” about the fighting and stands ready to play mediator. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also expressed worry. His spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said in a statement that the U.N. chief “urges an immediate end to the fighting and calls on all involved to take immediate steps to deescalate the situation and refrain from provocative rhetoric.” ___ Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, and Edith M.

Following days of procrastination and mixed messages, British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the wearing of face coverings will be mandatory in shops and supermarkets in England from July 24. On the other side of the English Channel, amid signs of a slight virus resurgence in France, President Emmanuel Macron said he also wants to require masks inside all indoor public spaces by Aug. 1. Britain and France previously took a more relaxed attitude to face coverings than many other European nations, recommending masks but not requiring them. Germany, Spain, Italy and Greece already require masks to be worn in enclosed spaces. But with their economies reeling after months-long lockdowns, French and U.K. government leaders were anxious to try to persuade people to spend again — hopefully without spreading the virus. Weeks of indecision made way for new rules that came into view virtually overnight. Britain’s Hancock told lawmakers in the House of Commons Tuesday that face covers can help workers and shoppers alike. “In recent weeks, we have reopened retail and footfall is rising,“ he said. “We want to give people more confidence to shop safely and enhance protection for those who work in shops.” People in England already have to wear face coverings on public transport and in hospital settings. Anyone not wearing a face covering in the additional environments outlined by the government could be fined 100 pounds ($125,) and shops can refuse entry to anyone failing to comply. Children under 11 and those with certain disabilities will be exempt. The new requirement only applies to England. The other nations of the U.K. — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — can determine their own public health policies, and Scotland already requires masks in shops. Hancock stressed that wearing a face covering complements other accepted strategies aimed at keeping a lid on the pandemic, such as washing hands and abiding by social distancing rules. “We cannot let our progress today lead to complacency tomorrow,” he said. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who in April spent a week in the hospital being treated for COVID-19, began wearing a bright blue mask in public last week. The change in policy followed. In an interview with French television networks marking Bastille Day, France’s Macron said “the best prevention” against the virus is masks, social distancing and hand washing. Recent rave parties in France and widespread backsliding on social distancing — even within Macron’s presidential palace and other government facilities — have raised concern lately, so the government has been weighing tougher mask guidance. “We have signs that (the virus) is picking up a bit,” Macron said, noting that France’s virus reproduction rate is inching past 1 again, meaning each infected person is infecting at least one other. British authorities are hoping the public will comply with the new requirement. London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the BBC he believed that “Londoners by and large will follow the rules,” without too much need for the police. “The problem is not the issue of enforcement, the problem is the mixed messages and the confused communications,’’ Khan said. British Environment Secretary George Eustice also did not rule out the possibility that mandatory face coverings would become compulsory in offices and other workplaces in the future. He told the BBC that the government was taking “one step at a time and we’ve taken the view in this next step that we should make it mandatory in retail environments.” A growing body of evidence suggests wearing face coverings brings some benefit in preventing the spread of the virus. “Lack of strong evidence of their effectiveness should not be considered a problem but the evidence is accumulating that they have a part to play in reducing transmission and also in protecting the wearer,“ said Keith Neal, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham. ___ Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report."

Yet for thousands of participants in a protest across town, the national homage wasn’t nearly enough to make up for missteps by French President Emmanuel Macron and his government before and during the coronavirus pandemic. Riot police sprayed tear gas and unruly demonstrators hurled smoke bombs as the largely peaceful demonstrators marched to Bastille plaza, where the French Revolution was born on July 14, 1789. The contrasting scenes marked a Bastille Day like any other, overshadowed by fears of resurgent infections in a country where more than 30,000 people have already lost their lives to the coronavirus. With tears in their eyes or smiles on their faces, medical workers stood silently as lengthy applause in their honour rang out over the Place de la Concorde in central Paris from Macron, the head of the World Health Organization and 2,000 other guests. A military choir sang the Marseillaise national anthem, and troops unfurled an enormous French tricolour flag across the plaza. The battle against the virus was the main focus, as Macron sought to highlight France’s successes in combating its worst crisis since World War II. Mirage and Rafale fighter jets painted the sky with blue-white-and-red smoke, and were joined by helicopters that had transported COVID-19 patients in distress. The guests included nurses, doctors, supermarket and nursing home workers, mask makers, lab technicians, undertakers and others who kept France going during its strict nationwide lockdown. Families of medical workers who died with the virus also had a place in the stands. Medics in jeans or sandals strolled onto the plaza for the climax of the ceremony, and the lengthy military parade was truncated into a smaller affair closed to the public to prevent new virus infections. In eastern Paris, meanwhile, medical workers’ unions marched to decry years of cost cuts that left public hospitals ill-prepared when the virus raced across France. “We are enormously short of personnel,” said protester Sylvie Pecard, a nurse at the Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris who described colleagues falling ill with the virus as COVID-19 patients filled its wards. “It’s because we haven’t recruited nurses. I came here 20 years ago and there were no empty positions. Now all the services are short of personnel, and it’s worse and worse.” Other protesters chanted slogans against police violence, spoke out against racial injustice, or against Macron policies seen as favouring the wealthy, or against his decision to appoint a man accused of rape to oversee French police forces. Some protesters wore yellow vests, representing their movement against economic injustice — or face masks in the same neon yellow shade. Riot police closely surrounded the crowd, and smoke from tear gas and firecrackers swirled around Bastille Plaza after sporadic tensions. Demonstrators sang in support of medical workers, while the Bastille Opera house displayed a huge message of thanks surrounded by portraits of nurses and doctors by street artist JR. In an interview with French television networks, Macron addressed the anger his presidency has unleashed, acknowledging “mistakes” in managing the pandemic and in pushing through business-friendly reforms. “Our country is afraid. There is a crisis of trust,” he said. He noted a new 8-billion-euro investment and hiring plan signed this week for French hospitals, but warned of “massive” unemployment and other economic problems still to come after months of virus lockdown. He announced no significant policy changes for the remaining 22 months of his term. He said masks would be required in indoor public places by Aug. 1, but that schools should resume as usual in September. France has one of the world’s highest virus death tolls, and scientists are warning of a potential resurgence as people abandon social distancing practices, hold dance parties and head off on summer vacations. At the main Bastille Day event, troops sported masks as they got in formation, took them off for the ceremony, then put them on again when it was over. Macron made a point of donning his before speaking to WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus. One government member panicked when she realized she forgot hers, but was saved by a colleague with a spare. All around France, towns and cities scaled back holiday festivities to stem virus infections. For Tuesday’s annual fireworks display over the Eiffel Tower, City Hall is closing off the heart of Paris, including embankments of the Seine and other neighbourhoods where crowds usually gather on Bastille Day. ___ Jeffrey Schaeffer, Christophe Ena and Francois Mori contributed to this report."

Merkel visited Herrenchiemsee palace — an opulent 19th-century edifice on a lake island inspired by France’s Versailles — at the invitation of Bavarian governor Markus Soeder. Her trip fed speculation about jostling in her Union bloc to run for chancellor in Germany’s next election, expected in the fall of 2021. Merkel, Germany’s leader since 2005, says she won’t seek a fifth term Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party plans to choose a new leader, its second since Merkel stood aside in 2018, in December. Three high-profile contenders are vying for the job and with it, a chance to be nominated as the centre-right candidate for chancellor. But the pandemic hasn’t helped them. Armin Laschet, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, was a vocal advocate of easing infection-control restrictions and has been criticized for his crisis management. Rivals Friedrich Merz and Norbert Roettgen don’t have government jobs and have had little chance to make an impact. That has put the spotlight on Soeder, the leader of the Christian Social Union — the CDU’s Bavaria-only sister party. Recent polls have shown Soeder, who was the first governor to lock down his state in March and has advocated a cautious approach to reopening, far ahead of the others among voters. Soeder has deflected questions about his future by saying that his place is in Bavaria. But he also raised eyebrows by suggesting recently that only someone who has proven himself in a crisis could run for chancellor — and by inviting Merkel to Tuesday’s Bavarian Cabinet meeting at Herrenchiemsee. No sitting chancellor had previously attended one. Soeder stressed their “common conviction of (the need for) prudence and caution.” Asked whether Soeder has what it takes to be chancellor, Merkel said she was exercising “particular restraint” on her succession and wouldn’t comment. She said she’d be happy to visit the Cabinets of other German states. “I can only say that Bavaria has a good governor and he invited me today,” Merkel said. “You’re not going to hear more from me.” No Christian Social Union candidate has previously become Germany’s leader. The party provided the centre-right’s candidates in 1980 and 2002, but both lost to incumbent centre-left chancellors."

The country’s Supreme Electoral Council said in a resolution published Tuesday that parties will have until June 7, 2021 — five months before the vote — to complete the legal registration process. Critics said the resolution was invalid, because such changes in voting rules should be approved by the national legislature. Elections, and term limits which President Daniel Ortega has already exceeded, have been an issue in protests in recent years. Ortega, 74, returned to power in 2007 following three failed attempts to win the presidency and won re-election in 2011. He sidestepped term limits to get himself re-elected in 2016, and packed courts and government agencies with allies. His Sandinista party controls the courts and the legislature. At least 325 people were killed in anti-government protests in 2018, according to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Starting in April 2018, Nicaragua’s economy was devastated by nearly five months of unrest initially sparked by cuts to social security benefits but which quickly evolved into calls for Ortega to step down and allow early elections. Nicaragua’s two main opposition groups announced the earlier this year they will form a coalition to compete in the 2021 race. Neither the Civic Alliance for Justice and Democracy nor the Blue and White National Unity movement are among Nicaragua’s political parties. Both formed after civil unrest exploded in April 2018."

Tuckman made Mexico her home for the next two decades, reporting, mainly for The Guardian, on drug violence, the disappeared, the struggles of women and migrants, and the uneven transition to democracy. In one of her last articles, published Jan. 2, she wrote about a new imprint of Mexican writer Tita Valencia’s 1976 novel Minotaur Fighting and other “works by Latin American women who were once feted but have fallen out of print.” Tuckman, 53, died in Mexico City on July 9 after being diagnosed with cancer last year. Colleagues remembered her as a committed journalist who mentored young writers. Jenaro Villamil, the head of Mexico’s public radio and TV system, praised Tuckman’s 2012 book “Mexico: Democracy Interrupted” and said she “fell in love with Mexico, with its bright and its dark sides.” “Jo’s departure deeply saddened all of us who knew her, of her commitment to social causes, to her great work and to life in general,” said Edgardo Buscaglia, an organized crime expert at Columbia University. Tuckman worked in the 1990s for The Associated Press as a freelancer in Guatemala, and then a staff employee in Spain. She also reported from Mexico for The Daily Telegraph and was an editor for Vice Mexico. A mother of two, she gravitated early toward Latin America, focusing on the region for a master’s degree at the University of London. Journalist Lomi Kriel spent time with Tuckman in the Darien rainforest in Panama, near the border with Colombia, while reporting in 2013 on climate change. They travelled in dug-out canoes and stayed with an Indigenous Emberá community, sleeping side by side in a thatched home on stilts. Tuckman generously shared knowledge about “freelancing and working internationally in difficult situations as a woman,” said Kriel, then a freelancer nervous about the assignment. “She has always been a role model, both in how she treated everyone around her and the adventure and light with which she approached learning about the world as a journalist. She is deeply missed – even by those who only met her once,” Kriel, who now works for the ProPublica/Texas Tribune investigative unit, wrote in an email. Ahead of 2012 elections that returned Mexico’s old ruling PRI party to power, Tuckman reported in The Guardian on documents purportedly showing that a unit of Televisa, Mexico’s leading TV and radio broadcaster, supported and promoted Enrique Peña Nieto, the PRI candidate. Televisa denied allegations of political bias. Tuckman also covered the 2014 disappearance of 43 students from a teacher’s college in the southern state of Guerrero, one of the most horrific cases of violence and corruption during Peña Nieto’s government. The students were abducted by local police and then allegedly turned over to a local gang that killed them and burned some of their bodies. “The challenge now is to make sure that interest is maintained in what is going on in Mexico so that the pressure that has been gathering around those issues of human rights, those issues of corruption, those issues of lack of accountability and transparency, don’t just fade away,” Tuckman said to Las Perlas TV, an online video service. Last week, Mexican authorities said they had identified the remains of a second of the 43 students who disappeared. It was a small step in a country haunted by impunity, corruption and extreme violence. Tuckman delivered plenty of humour and humanity in her reporting. On assignment for the AP, she interviewed a Mexican tequila industry regulator who displayed a bottle adorned with a vulture in dark glasses and said it “gives you the message, `Let’s go crazy.? In 2014, she wrote in The Guardian about violence driving Central American child migrants to the U.S. border and spoke to a man who said: “My granddaughter was the apple of my eye... I cried for a month after she left, but it is the best thing. Honduras is not a place for children.” The work, Tuckman said in a 2013 interview with Mexican journalist Blanche Petrich, is “a privilege.?"
253,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/ts/news/world/americas/2020/07/13/brazil-sacks-official-after-soaring-june-deforestation-data.html,Brazil sacks official after soaring June deforestation data,['David Biller And Mauricio SavareseThe Associated Press'],"Mon., July 13, 2020","RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazil’s government on Monday fired an official at the national space agency Inpe whose department is responsible for satellite monitoring of the Amazon rainforest, just three days after the release of June deforestation data reflected a continued increase in degradation. Lubia Vinhas was the general-co-ordinator of Brazilian space agency Inpe’s Earth Observation Institute, which is an umbrella for divisions that monitor the Amazon and panels to debate climate change with civil society organizations. It’s unclear whether the removal of Vinhas from her position was connected to the data. Her subordinate who heads the division directly overseeing satellite monitoring of Amazon deforestation remains employed. Inpe said in a statement posted to its website Monday night that the change was part of a shake-up at the agency to improve synergies. Still, the timing of the dismissal -- coming on the heels of June data -- drew an outcry from environmentalists who claim it may be an echo of a high-profile firing at the same agency last year. President Jair Bolsonaro is a critic of environmentalists and defends fostering more economic development in the Amazon, which many adversaries see as a nod to illegal miners and loggers. Vinhas was picked in 2018 for a four-year but Science and Technology Minister Marcos Pontes decided to remove her after 2 years and 3 months on the job. Inpe said in its statement that Vinhas’ former department will be merged with others, and she will oversee implementation of a new georeferencing database. Inpe figures published on Friday showed 400 square miles (1,034 square kilometres) of deforestation in the Amazon in June, a new record the month since data started being gathered in 2015. Total deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon from January to June was 1,890 square miles (3,069 square kilometres), up 25% from the same six-month period last year. Outside observers are keeping close tabs on Brazil’s environmental stewardship just ahead of the so-called burning season, during which landholders use fire to clear brush and forest. That includes asset managers who say they are assessing whether to divest from Brazil and last week spoke with the environment minister and Vice-President Gen. Hamilton Mourão, . Bolsonaro also put the Army in charge of efforts to curb deforestation in May after last year’s fires pushed destruction to the highest level in 11 years. Yet data from Inpe show that it kept climbing. Marcio Astrini, the executive-secretary of the Brazilian Climate Observatory, a coalition of civil society groups, alleged that the government has previously made clear its desire to intervene in Inpe. “The removal of Lubia Vinhas could be an indication that the plan was never abandoned. This is happening as deforestation accelerates, when the administration needs to stop threats of divestment,” Astrini said in a statement. Suely Vaz, former head of environment regulator IBAMA, said before the release of the June data that the army isn’t using the technical planning and intelligence required, nor are they trained in such methods to stop deforestation. She added that it costs more than $10 million per month for the army to operate in the Amazon -- more than half what IBAMA spends on oversight in a year. “Control of deforestation isn’t done by sending a lot of inexperienced people to the field,” Vaz said. “They can help, but the operations need to be conducted by environmental authorities.” In the midst of the international outcry over the Amazon fires in August, Bolsonaro accused the then-head of Brazil’s space research institute, Ricardo Galvão, of manipulating satellite deforestation data in order to undermine his administration. Galvão publicly countered the claims, and was fired. _____ Savarese reported from Sao Paulo."

Sales of tickets in a symbolic raffle for the plane have also resumed after a monthslong pause caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly a quarter of the 6 million $25 tickets have been sold. Each of the 100 winners will collect about $1 million. López Obrador wants to sell the plane, which he views as an extravagance. The president flies commercial, including for his first trip abroad last week to Washington with layovers both ways. The custom Boeing 787 was purchased for $200 million under his predecessor, Enrique Peña Nieto.

Jefferson told The Associated Press that he went to the presidential Planalto Palace and sat in front of a large television where he could see Bolsonaro in a makeshift office at his residence. “I found the president well, flushed, willing. In very good health,” Jefferson said Saturday. “I only saw him cough once, when I made a joke.” Since his diagnosis, Bolsonaro has held virtual meetings almost every day with Jorge Oliveira, secretary-general of government, to sign official documents. According to Oliveira’s office, a protocol was created so work could be carried out digitally. This was also how Bolsonaro interviewed candidates to head the education ministry, he said on Facebook on Thursday. The following day, he named to the post Milton Ribeiro, a former deputy dean of Mackenzie University in Sao Paulo who preaches at a Presbyterian church in Santos, outside the metropolis. Only a few aides who were previously infected by the new coronavirus could get close to Bolsonaro during the week, one of them said on Tuesday. The person declined to be named, citing lack of authorization to speak with journalists. Bolsonaro also spent some time in the afternoons in front of the palace with photojournalists 400 yards away, on the other side of a garden. He had met his supporters by that garden until his diagnosis, but no longer. The new routine marks a stark change for Bolsonaro, who spent months attending rallies with his fans, heading out to bakeries and food trucks to mix and mingle. He sometimes declined to wear a mask. He has scoffed at the restrictions mayors and governors implemented to contain the spread of the virus, arguing their economic impacts would cause more suffering than the virus, which he repeatedly called “a little flu.” Bolsonaro took hydroxychloroquine pills for five days, Monday through Friday, according to a member of the presidential medical team who asked to not be identified, citing patient confidentiality and because the person isn’t authorized to speak publicly. The drug has no proven effect on the treatment of COVID-19 and can cause side effects such as cardiac arrhythmia, according to medical studies. As a result, Bolsonaro was subjected to electrocardiograms and blood tests, the person said. Brazil’s presidential press office said in a statement that the president has experienced no medical problems with his treatment. The aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said Bolsonaro slept in a different bedroom to keep the first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, safe. He lives with her, his daughter and step-daughter. On Saturday, the first lady shared a photo of her COVID-19 test results showing she was not infected. “My daughters and I tested negative for COVID-19,” she wrote in the post on her verified Instagram account. “I appreciate the prayers.” On Thursday, Jair Bolsonaro held his weekly live broadcast on Facebook. This time, he was not accompanied by a minister or a sign language interpreter, as usual. Despite saying he felt well, he said he should still be isolated next week, so as to avoid contaminating anyone. “I’m sorry I can’t interact with you here. Not even next week will it be possible, because I think I will not yet be completely free of the virus, so I will not have anyone on my side here,” Bolsonaro said on the broadcast. During the broadcast, he wasn’t wearing a mask. But the aide said Bolsonaro now regularly wears the equipment to protect both his family and the more than 100 employees who work at the residence."

The images emerge as Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan say the latest talks on the contentious project ended Monday with no agreement. Ethiopia has said it would begin filling the reservoir of the $4.6 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam this month even without a deal, which would further escalate tensions. But the swelling reservoir, captured in imagery on July 9 by the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 satellite, is likely a “natural backing-up of water behind the dam” during this rainy season, International Crisis Group analyst William Davison told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “So far, to my understanding, there has been no official announcement from Ethiopia that all of the pieces of construction that are needed to be completed to close off all of the outlets and to begin impoundment of water into the reservoir” have occurred, Davison said. But Ethiopia is on schedule for impoundment to begin in mid-July, he added, when the rainy season floods the Blue Nile. Ethiopian officials did not comment on the images. The latest setback in the three-country talks shrinks hopes that an agreement will be reached before Ethiopia begins filling the reservoir. Ethiopia says the colossal dam offers a critical opportunity to pull millions of its nearly 110 million citizens out of poverty and become a major power exporter. Downstream Egypt, which depends on the Nile to supply its farmers and booming population of 100 million with fresh water, asserts that the dam poses an existential threat. Experts fear that filling the dam without a deal could push the countries to the brink of military conflict. But Kevin Wheeler, a researcher at the Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, told The Associated Press that fears of any immediate water shortage “are not justified at this stage at all. If there were a drought over the next several years, that certainly could become a risk.“ He said the escalating rhetoric is more due to changing “power dynamics” in the region. Years of talks with a variety of mediators, including the Trump administration, have failed to produce a solution. Last week’s round, mediated by the African Union and observed by U.S. and European officials, proved no different. “Although there were progresses, no breakthrough deal is made,” Seleshi Bekele, Ethiopia’s minister of water, irrigation and energy, tweeted overnight. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukry in an interview with Egypt’s DMC TV channel warned Monday that Egypt may be compelled to appeal again to the U.N. Security Council to intervene in the dispute. Ethiopia rejects that, preferring regional bodies like the African Union to mediate. Meanwhile the countries agreed they would send their reports to the AU and reconvene in a week to determine next steps. Between Egypt and Ethiopia lies Sudan, which stands to benefit from the dam through access to cheap electricity and reduced flooding. But it has also raised fears over the dam’s operation, which could endanger its own smaller dams depending on the amount of water discharged daily downstream. Sudanese Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas on Monday said the parties were “keen to find a solution” but technical and legal disagreements persist over its filling and operation. Most important, he said, are the questions about how much water Ethiopia will release downstream if a multi-year drought occurs and how the countries will resolve any future disputes. Hisham Kahin, a member of Sudan’s legal committee in the dam negotiations, said 70% to 80% of negotiations turned on the question of whether an agreement would be legally binding. ___ Associated Press writers in Cairo contributed."

That’s according to a Health Ministry statement and data compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers, which showed the U.K. with 292,931 confirmed cases. The pandemic is now spreading swiftly in parts of the African continent of 1.3 billion people as the world’s most poorly funded health systems begin to face what experts have warned all along: They would be rapidly overwhelmed. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa this week said many more virus infections have gone undetected despite the country conducting more than 2.2 million tests, by far the most of any African nation. A strict lockdown had delayed South Africa’s surge in cases but it has been loosened under economic pressure. Now, what the president calls the “storm” has arrived, and it is already “stretching our resources and our resolve to their limits.” Shortages of medical oxygen have been reported as the number of COVID-19 patients seeking help in breathing grows. Public hospital beds across the country could fill up within the month. South Africa grapples with the pandemic in the dead of winter, with temperatures in the outbreak epicenter, Gauteng province and Johannesburg, forecast to drop below freezing overnight. That makes ventilation a challenge especially in small, crowded homes for the poor. While public health officials in the United States and elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere warn that fall and winter could be a severe test, South Africa is already demonstrating some of the dangers to come. ___ Follow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak "

State television South African Broadcasting Corporation has reported that Mandela died at a Johannesburg hospital early Monday morning. The cause of her death has not been announced. She had been South Africa’s ambassador to Denmark since 2015. The Mandelas’ daughter came to international prominence in 1985, when the white minority government offered to release Nelson Mandela from prison if he denounced violence perpetrated by his movement, the Africa National Congress, against apartheid, the brutal system of racial discrimination enforced in South Africa at that time. Zindzi Mandela read his letter rejecting the offer at a packed public meeting that was broadcast around the world. Last year Mandela stirred controversy by calling for the return of the white-owned land to South Africa’s dispossessed Black majority. “Dear Apartheid Apologists, your time is over. You will not rule again. We do not fear you. Finally #TheLandIsOurs,” she tweeted in June last year. South Africa’s foreign affairs minister Naledi Pandor has expressed shock at Mandela’s death, describing her as a heroine. “Zindzi will not only be remembered as a daughter of our struggle heroes, Tata Nelson and Mama Winnie Mandela, but as a struggle heroine in her own right. She served South Africa well,” said Pandor. She is survived by her husband and four children."

Confronted by surging hospitalizations due to the coronavirus, South Africa is also reinstating a night curfew to reduce traffic accidents and made it mandatory for all residents to wear face masks when in public. Ramaphosa said, in a nationally televised address Sunday night, that top health officials warn of impending shortages of hospital beds and medical oxygen as South Africa reaches a peak of COVID-19 cases, expected between the end of July and September. He said some hospitals have had to turn away patients because all their beds are full. South Africa’s rapid increase in reported cases has made it one of the world’s centres for COVID-19, as it is ranked as the 9th country most affected by the disease, according to Johns Hopkins University. The country has reported increases of more than 10,000 confirmed cases for several days and the latest daily increase was nearly 13,500. South Africa accounts for 40% of all the confirmed cases in Africa, with 276,242, an increase of 12,058 in one day. South Africa has recorded 4,079 deaths, 25% of which have been in the past week, said Ramaphosa. “While the surge of infections has been expected, the force and the speed with which it has progressed has, quite understandably, caused great concern,“ said Ramaphosa. “Many of us are fearful of the danger this presents for ourselves, and for our families.” Ramaphosa said that since the sale of alcohol was re-introduced on in June, hospitals have experienced a spike in admissions in their trauma and emergency wards. The countrywide curfew mandates that people must not be on the roads between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m. effective Monday. Masks have also been declared mandatory, with all transport operators, employers, and owners of businesses and buildings now legally obliged to ensure everyone entering their businesses or premises are wearing masks. Ramaphosa lambasted citizens who have continued to have social gatherings, including parties and overcrowded funerals, saying they had contributed significantly to the rapid spread of the virus. “In the midst of our national effort to fight against this virus there are a number of people who have taken to organizing parties, who have drinking sprees, and some who walk around in crowded spaces without masks,” he said. South Africa imposed one of the world’s strictest lockdowns in April and May, including closing virtually all mines, factories and businesses, and a ban on sales of liquor and cigarettes. The measures slowed the spread of the coronavirus but South Africa’s economy, already in recession, contracted dramatically, increasing unemployment above 30% and hunger. In June the country began relaxing restrictions to allow millions of South Africans to return to work. The easing of restrictions allowed the sales of alcohol on four days a week. However, within a few weeks the country’s numbers of confirmed cases and hospitalizations increased dramatically, bringing Ramaphosa to reimpose the ban on alcohol sales and other restrictions. More than 30% of South Africa’s cases are in the economic hub of Gauteng province, which includes the largest city, Johannesburg, and the capital, Pretoria. The tourist centre of Cape Town also has a high number of cases. Johannesburg’s densely populated Soweto township has a high concentration of cases, according to officials. “We knew that with the easing of restrictions, the number of cases would go up. But what is surprising is the speed with which the case numbers have grown,” said Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, who is on the national coronavirus committee that is advising Ramaphosa. “We can expect to see the numbers of cases and hospitalizations to increase for a number of weeks ... this will continue for the next six to eight weeks. By October we may be seeing a decline.” South Africa has carried out 2.1 million tests, on its population of 58 million. Because of an international shortage of testing materials, South Africa in June experienced a long delay in the time to get test results, at one point reaching 12 days in government clinics. The situation has improved and the average time to get test results is five days in by public laboratories and two days in private labs, according to the latest figures issued by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. Africa’s 54 countries have reported 577,904 cases, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The continent’s confirmed cases are concentrated in four countries -- South Africa, Egypt with 81,158 cases, Nigeria with 31,987 cases and Algeria with 18,712 cases – which together make up more than 65% of the continent’s cases. The number of actual cases in Africa is believed to be much higher, as the testing rate is very low in many countries."

LedererThe Associated Press'],"Sat., July 11, 2020","TANZANIA, Tanzania - Russia scored a victory for its ally Syria on Saturday by forcing the Security Council to limit humanitarian aid deliveries to the country’s mainly rebel-held northwest to just one crossing point from Turkey, a move that Western nations say will cut a lifeline for 1.3 million people. Russia argues that aid should be delivered from within the country across conflict lines, and says only one crossing point is needed. U.N. officials and humanitarian groups argued unsuccessfully — along with the vast majority of the U.N. Security Council — that the two crossing points in operation until their mandate expired Friday were essential for getting help to millions of needy people in Syria’s northwest, especially with the first case of COVID-19 recently reported in the region. The Security Council vote approving a single crossing from Turkey was 12-0, with Russia, China and the Dominican Republic abstaining. The vote capped a week of high-stakes rivalry pitting Russia and China against the 13 other council members. An overwhelming majority voted twice to maintain the two crossings from Turkey, but Russia and China vetoed both resolutions — the 15th and 16th veto by Russia of a Syria resolution since the conflict began in 2011 and the ninth and 10th by China. Germany and Belgium, which had sponsored the widely supported resolutions for two crossing points, finally had to back down to the threat of another Russian veto. The resolution they put forward Saturday authorized only a single crossing point from Turkey for a year. In January, Russia also scored a victory for Syria, using its veto threat to force the Security Council to adopt a resolution reducing the number of crossing points for aid deliveries from four to two, from Turkey to the northwest. It also cut in half the yearlong mandate that had been in place since cross-border deliveries began in 2014 to six months. Before adopting the resolution Saturday, the council rejected two amendments proposed by Russia, including one suggesting that U.S. and European Union sanctions on Syria were impeding humanitarian aid. That contention was vehemently rejected by the Trump administration and the EU, which noted their sanctions include exemptions for humanitarian deliveries. It also rejected an amendment from China. Russia’s deputy U.N. ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, said after the vote that from the beginning Moscow had proposed one crossing — from Bab al-Hawa to Idlib — and that Saturday’s resolution could have been adopted weeks ago. He said Russia abstained in the vote because negotiations over the resolution were marred by “clumsiness, disrespect.” Polyansky accused Western nations on the council of “unprecedented heights” of hypocrisy, saying they were ready to jeopardize cross-border aid over the references to unilateral sanctions. He said cross-border aid to Syria’s northwest doesn’t comply with international law because the U.N. has no presence in the region, which he described as being controlled “by international terrorists and fighters” that make it impossible to control and monitor who gets aid. German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen retorted that while Russia talks about delivery of aid across conflict lines, “in practice it doesn’t” happen. He said his side fought to maintain multiple crossing points for aid, including the Al-Yaroubiya crossing point from Iraq in the northeast that was closed in January, because that is what is needed for efficient delivery of aid to millions in need — and he asked Polyansky “this is clumsy?” “This is what we tried to do over these past weeks, to get the optimum to the population,” Heusgen said. U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft told the council: “Today’s outcome leaves us sickened and outraged at the loss of the Bab al-Salaam and Al Yarubiyah border crossings.” “Behind those locked gates are millions of women, children, and men who believed that the world had heard their pleas. Their health and welfare are now at great risk,” she said. Still, Craft called the authorization of access through Bab al-Hawa for 12 months “a victory” in light of Russia and China’s “willingness to use their veto to compel a dramatic reduction in humanitarian assistance.” “This solemn victory must not end our struggle to address the mounting human needs in Syria — that fight is far from over,” Craft said. Belgium and Germany said in a joint statement that 1.3 million people, including 800 000 displaced Syrians, live in the Aleppo area, including 500,000 children who received humanitarian aid through the Bab al-Salam crossing — and now have that aid cut off. “Today is yet another sad day. It is a sad day for this council, but mostly, it is a sad day for the Syrian people of that region.,” they said. “Both Yarubiyah and Bab al-Salam were vital crossings to deliver, in the most efficient way possible, the humanitarian help, those people deserve.” In a later statement, they added: “One border crossing is not enough, but no border crossings would have left the fate of an entire region in question.”"

The turnout was far smaller than the thousands who surged through the streets Friday, briefly occupying the state television station and setting fires. At least three people had been killed and more than 70 wounded in the two days of demonstrations, according to a report from the Gabriel Toure Hospital in Bamako to government officials that was seen by The Associated Press. There were also reports of arrests of opposition leaders. Friday’s developments marked a major escalation in the growing movement against President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, who still has two years left in office in this West African country long destabilized by Islamic extremists. His overnight address to the nation took a conciliatory gesture days after he had tried to appease the protesters by promising to revamp the constitutional court whose legislative election results in April have been disputed by several dozen candidates. “I would like once again to reassure our people of my willingness to continue the dialogue and reiterate my readiness to take all measures in my power to calm the situation,” he said. The anti-government movement still wants the National Assembly dissolved. Its name, the June 5 Movement, or M5, reflects the day demonstrators first took to the streets en masse. While the group has officially backed down from its calls that Keita leave office, some protesters still want him gone. “At this point, all possible scenarios are possible. We are in a cycle of ingovernability,“ Baba Dakono, a researcher and political analyst, told AP. “It is difficult now to say whether President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita can still benefit from the support of the army,” because the behaviour of the officers in contact with the troops can’t be predicted. “Dialogue between the parties is necessary to break the deadlock,” he said. Keita came to power after a French-led military operation to oust Islamic extremists from power in northern Mali’s towns in 2013, winning the first democratic elections organized after a military coup the year before. Despite the presence of U.N. peacekeepers, and French and regional forces backing Malian troops, extremist groups continue to mount attacks. Last year was particularly deadly as hundreds of soldiers were killed in the north, forcing the military at one point to close down some of its most remote and vulnerable outposts. It prompted criticism of how the government was handling the crisis. The last democratically elected leader before Keita, President Amadou Toumani Toure, was overthrown in the 2012 coup after a decade in power. The political chaos that ensued has been blamed for creating a power vacuum that allowed the Islamic insurgency to take hold in the north. Following international pressure, that coup leader later handed over power to a civilian transitional government that organized elections."

Muller shocked lawmakers in the right-of-centre party when he issued a statement early Tuesday morning saying he was stepping down “effective immediately.” The 67-year-old former business executive had led the party for only 53 days, toppling previous leader Simon Bridges in a leadership coup amid National’s stagnant polling numbers. Collins was chosen to take over the leadership in a hastily arranged meeting of the party’s parliamentary caucus in Wellington on Tuesday evening. She is National’s fourth leader in three years and its second female leader. Collins was first elected to Parliament in 2002, serving in governments under prime ministers John Key and Bill English. She held police and corrections portfolios and is seen to represent the right-wing of the National Party, having previously promoted strong law and order policies. Collins now faces the task of trying to rally National’s support 67 days from Sept. 19 elections at which it will try to unseat the governing Labour Party of popular Prime Minister Jacina Ardern. Recent polls show Labour with sufficient support to form a majority government, a first since New Zealand adopted a system of proportional representation in 1996. All previous governments since that time have been coalitions and Labour currently governs with the support of the Green Party and right-of-centre New Zealand First. Muller’s sudden departure forced a scramble of lawmakers to Wellington during a parliamentary recess. Collins is understood to have won a contested leadership contest, but details of the vote have not been released. Muller said his health made his continuation in the leadership untenable. “It has become clear to me that I am not the best person to be leader of the Opposition and Leader of the New Zealand National Party at this critical time for New Zealand,” Muller said. “It is more important than ever that the New Zealand National Party has a leader who is comfortable in the role. “The role has taken a heavy toll on me personally, and on my family, and this has become untenable from a health perspective.” The National Party has been embroiled in scandal for the past week after it was revealed a junior lawmaker leaked private health details of New Zealand coronavirus patients to news media. The information was provided by a former party president who received it confidentially in her capacity as acting chief executive of the Auckland rescue helicopter organization. Muller was a low-profile member of the party when he was chosen to lead the coup that toppled Bridges, whose lack of popularity with voters had begun to worry party lawmakers as the election approached. National has struggled to dent the popularity of charismatic Prime Minister Ardern, whose government has high approval ratings for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand has gone 73 days without a case of community transmission and has suffered only 22 deaths. Life has returned largely to normal with schools, bars and restaurants all open and with packed stadiums at sports events."

The National Archives of Australia released more than 1,200 pages of letters and press clippings between Buckingham Palace and Governor-General Sir John Kerr from August 1974 to December 1977 after a court ruled in May that they could not be kept secret indefinitely. Kerr dismissed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam’s reforming centre-left Labor Party government on Nov. 11, 1975, to resolve a deadlock in Parliament on the authority of the queen, who is Australia’s head of state. The queen’s private secretary, Sir Martin Charteris, wrote to Kerr on Nov. 4, 1975, that the monarch’s power to dissolve a parliament had not been used in years and some argued that the power no longer existed. “I do not believe this to be true,” Charteris wrote. Charteris also wrote that if Kerr did “what the constitution dictates, you cannot possible (sic) do the Monarchy any avoidable harm.” “The chances are you will do it good,” Charteris said. Kerr did not tell the queen he had decided to remove Whitlam and replace him with opposition leader Malcolm Fraser as caretaker prime minister until after he had done it. “I was of the opinion that it was better for Her Majesty not to know in advance,” Kerr wrote on Nov. 11, immediately after taking the unprecedented step. The palace said the letters proved that the decision to dismiss the Whitlam government was Kerr’s alone. “While the Royal Household believes in the longstanding convention that all conversations between prime ministers, governor generals and the queen are private, the release of the letters ... confirms that neither Her Majesty nor the Royal Household had any part to play in Kerr’s decision to dismiss Whitlam,” a palace statement said. Charteris congratulated Kerr for not warning Whitman that he was considering bringing down his government. That could have put the queen in an “impossible position” if Whitlam tried to get her to fire Kerr while Kerr was trying to fire Whitlam. Kerr died in 1991. Charteris also revealed that Whitlam had telephoned him at 4:15 a.m. London time on Nov. 11 as a “private citizen” and said he should be “recommissioned” as prime minister so that he could choose the date of the next election. “He spoke calmly and did not ask me to make an approach to the queen or indeed do anything other than the suggestion that I should speak to you and find out what was going on,” Charteris wrote to Kerr on Nov. 17 . Sydney University constitutional law expert Anne Twomey said the letters undermined the theory that Whitlam had been brought down by the British royal family. The letters show that Whitlam had sought British intervention to keep him in power, she said. “The only smoking gun is Whitlam himself trying to get reinstated,” Twomey said. The only dismissal of an elected Australian government on the authority of a British monarch triggered a political crisis that spurred many to call for Australia to sever its constitutional ties with Britain and create a republic with an Australian president. Suspicions of a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency conspiracy persist. The release of the letters is a victory for historian and Whitlam biographer Jenny Hocking who has been trying for years to get access to them. Hocking said the head of a constitutional monarchy must at all times remain politically neutral. But she said she was startled by the level of discussion that had occurred between Kerr and Buckingham Palace “over matters that were intensely and profoundly political.” She described Charteris’ advice to Kerr on his powers and how they should be used as “scandalous.” “The nature of the letters, the fact that a dismissal of an elected government took place using what are largely seen as arcane reserve powers of the Crown, and the fact ... we can now see such a depth of discussion between the Palace and the governor-general of the time will inevitably make people think about where we want to go as an independent, autonomous nation,” Hocking said. Labour leader Anthony Albanese, Australia’s opposition leader, said the 1975 crisis reinforced the need for an Australian head of state instead of the British monarch. “It is, I think, a blight on our character as a nation that a democratically elected government was dismissed,” Albanese said. “The action of the governor-general on Nov. 11 to dismiss a government, to put himself above the Australian people, is one that reinforces the need for us to have an Australian head of state, reinforces the need for us to stand on our own two feet,” he added."

How many millions of dollars are being spent on roads for cars? Are we getting value for money?  A massive amount of public space is being given away for these death machines to hurtle about and to be parked when they are not moving. Yet when a fraction of that money is given over to the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, columnists like D’Amato talk as if we have somehow become a Communist dictatorship.

There is still so much that is unknown. Will there be another wave of the coronavirus this fall? If so, how severe will it be? Will the volume of customers at shopping malls, restaurants, hotels and other businesses be anything like what existed before the pandemic? Unfortunately, nothing can be predicted with much accuracy. But one thing that seems likely is there will continue to be a great deal of variation in how the virus affects our communities. Already, we have seen how the outbreak in many smaller communities was quite different from what we saw in Waterloo Region, the Greater Toronto Area and Windsor-Essex. The Ontario government wisely responded with a regional approach to reopening that set different dates for different municipalities. Continuing with a community-specific approach will be key to an effective recovery in the months ahead. Governments must ensure employers have the autonomy and flexibility to respond to the unique and very specific market forces in their communities. The same will be true for post-secondary institutions that prepare people for the labour market. Providing colleges with more autonomy is one of the central themes in a recently released white paper, “The Future of Ontario’s Workers,” by the StrategyCorp Institute of Public Policy and Economy. To help Ontario recover from the pandemic, the paper recommends Ontario equip colleges to respond more quickly to specific shifts within each community. One of the paper’s most important arguments is the recommendation that colleges acquire more autonomy to create a broader range of programs and credentials. Ontario’s economic recovery will require rapid private sector growth supported by a highly qualified workforce. Giving colleges more autonomy to create cutting-edge programs that provide people with the expertise to succeed will be pivotal to Ontario’s success. This would include the government allowing colleges to create career-specific three-year degree programs to replace many of the existing diploma programs. Allowing colleges to award three-year degrees — rather than diplomas — means graduates would finally receive full recognition for their academic achievements. It would make a huge difference in Waterloo Region and much of the province. The degrees in science and technology and other fields would make the programs attractive to more students. That’s because the degree credential would provide graduates with more opportunities for employment and advancement. That means greater numbers of students would enrol in post-secondary programs that are important to local employers. Awarding the degrees to graduates would also mean many companies would be in a stronger position to promote themselves internationally, as degrees are the globally recognized credential for such programs. The StrategyCorp institute’s paper makes other important recommendations to enrich the offerings at colleges. For example, it recommends creating master’s degree programs for university and college graduates in high-demand fields such as robotics, cybersecurity and animation. It also recommends increasing the funding for short-term micro-credential programs to help more unemployed and underemployed workers quickly retrain for new careers and supports the ongoing transition to lifelong learning. The recommendations come as Ontario Colleges and Universities Minister Ross Romano consults on ways to modernize post-secondary education. Colleges are urging the government to create a new provincial strategy for higher education that adopts the recommendations in the white paper. Ontario has the potential to emerge from this pandemic as a global leader in post-secondary education. We should seize the opportunity to strengthen higher education to help drive economic growth and create more opportunities for people to succeed in their careers."

How much longer can the world’s longest undefended border remain largely sealed?  It’s an increasingly urgent question facing Canadian governments. Even with the U.S. border open for commercial business, and exceptions being made to allow families to reunite, our joint border is mostly closed. And the impact is huge. This discussion is relevant this week for a couple of reasons. First, the current emergency border-crossing restriction package is set to expire July 21. Second, the government is facing mounting pressure from commercial interests. The Canadian Travel & Tourism Roundtable, a coalition of 120-odd travel and tourism companies including Canada’s major airlines, last month sent an open letter to the government calling for the loosening of travel restrictions.  A second open letter was sent by Canada’s airlines and many of Canada’s biggest companies including banks and telecoms. On one hand it is hard to blame the tourism sector, which has been among the hardest hit by the pandemic, for putting its economic interests first. But it is also more than a little troubling that airlines were quick to do away with social distancing minimums when we know they are crucial in slowing the spread of COVID-19.  Fortunately, it’s not up to the tourism/travel sector to make public policy. That’s up to the government, and based on what top officials such as Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland are saying, protecting public health is still the top priority. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: “We are going to be very, very careful about when and how we start reopening international borders.” Something most people do not recognize is that cross-border traffic is already increasing thanks to loosening of some restrictions. The volume of traffic crossing land borders has increased from about 115,000 a week from late April to early May to 175,000 a week in late June. Officials say those figures include commercial and non-commercial traffic. The number of non-commercial highway travellers entering Canada has nearly doubled over that period, going from about 3,300 a week to about 6,500. At the same time as Canada is allowing more cross-border traffic, the situation in the U.S. is deteriorating. As recently as the weekend states like Florida were announcing record new infections and deaths. Florida alone reported more than 15,000 new cases. American leadership is polarized, with the Trump administration basically in denial. Some states are rolling back reopening, others seem unwilling to do so despite exploding infection rates. Worst of all, America has no apparent unified strategy to regain control. Even if Trump loses the November election, it’s predicted to take months to change direction and get COVID under control.  Under these circumstances, how on earth could Canada even consider significantly loosening border controls? Doing so would literally put at risk everything this country has done right to flatten the pandemic curve. All the work and sacrifice Canadians have endured would be at risk.  It is said that governing in these times is an ongoing struggle to balance safety with renewed prosperity. Fair enough. But on some fronts there can be no overall compromise. The U.S. is not a safe place to be, and Canada should not face further exposure until things change. That could easily keep the border closed until the end of this year, at least, say infectious disease experts. It’s a sad reality with a great cost to Canadians and our economy. But we have no choice."

But that’s what the bizarre decision by the prime minister and his Liberal government to award a fat, untendered contract to WE Charity has accomplished in the blink of an eye. From pandemic hero to — in the minds of some Canadians at least — a zero: That’s been the latest downward trajectory of Trudeau’s reputation. It seemed strange from the start that the Liberals handed WE Charity the formidable job of administering a pandemic-related program worth $912 million. The federal bureaucracy had already been deemed fit to run the two main COVID-19 economic aid programs — the Canada Emergency Relief Benefit and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy — with their combined cost of over $160 billion. Why federal civil servants were considered incapable of handling a fraction of that money to encourage young Canadians to provide volunteer services remains a mystery. Questioned about the WE Charity deal, Trudeau initially insisted no one else in Canada could possibly manage the program. So no one else was asked. WE Charity’s modus operandi fuelled more questions and astonishment. It was to receive at least $19.5 million for administering the volunteer program with $5 million of that going to other organizations. Camps would benefit to the tune of $25,000 for hiring volunteers. School teachers would be eligible for up to $12,000 if they enlisted as many as 75 student volunteers. WE Charity itself was on track to employ 450 of those volunteers — which seemed like having its federally-funded cake and eating it too. Such oddities — along with the criticism that it’s oxymoronic to be paying volunteers in the first place — resulted in the government and WE Charity ending their partnership on July 3 and the job of hiring volunteers being handed to the very public servants who had earlier been denied the job. But the steady drip of new embarrassments and new irregularities continues. Late last week, the public learned that far from being properly distanced from the WE Charity deal as he had previously stated, Trudeau sat at the table when cabinet approved the arrangement. Nor did he recuse himself from the decision even though his strong personal connections to WE Charity — he’s friends with the organization’s head honchos Craig and Marc Kielburger — should have raised alarms about a potential conflict of interest. Finance Minister Bill Morneau made the same serious mistake and failed to recuse himself from cabinet’s decision, despite the fact that his daughter, Grace Acan, works for WE Charity. Myopia must be catching. Like a package of fish left out on summer’s day, the longer this fiasco drags on, the worse it smells. Now it turns out three members of Trudeau’s family have received money from WE Charity for their services.  The prime minister’s mother, Margaret Trudeau, was paid about $250,000 to speak at 28 WE Charity events while brother Alexandre Trudeau got $32,000 for appearing at eight. All this happened when Trudeau was in government. Before he was PM, his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau received $1,400 for headlining a 2012 WE Charity event. The prime minister has already been found to have violated conflict-of-interest laws on two occasions. Why he didn’t learn from that, and as a result is being investigated again by the federal ethics commissioner, is as baffling as everything else in his latest scandal. Is it hubris, sloppiness or blindness that explains the latest stumble? Or something more serious? We wait just as we wonder about WE."

For example, they might have made Ontario Premier Doug Ford stop before trying to install one of his pals as the head of the provincial police. They surely would have kept Prime Minister Justin Trudeau from stumbling stupidly into a conflict of interest over the sole source contract that his government awarded to WE Charity, an organization with which the Trudeau family has been involved for several years. Under the contract, now abruptly terminated, the charity was to receive roughly $14.5 million to administer a program that would distribute $900 million in federal grants to support summer jobs for students during the COVID-19 crisis. There was something “off” about the WE deal from the outset. The government did not need an outside contractor to set up or manage the array of programs it created to pump out billions of assistance dollars during the pandemic – programs like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) and Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). The government proved it is remarkably efficient at giving away money. Why then did it need WE to help it give away money through the Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG)? That question alone should have set alarm bells ringing in the corridors of power. And if – through careless indifference or some inexcusable failure of due diligence – it did not set off alarms, the Trudeau family connection with WE certainly should have. Justin is close to his mother. It is inconceivable that he was unaware that she was collecting speaking fees from WE – $250,000 for 28 speeches between 2016 and 2020 – and unlikely that he did not know his filmmaker brother Alexandre (“Sacha”) was drinking from the same well ($32,000 for four WE speeches).  He should not have touched the WE contract with a barge pole. He should not have brought it before cabinet and, if another minister proposed it, he was ethically obligated to recuse himself from the discussion and vote. Now, the Commons ethics commissioner is investigating the prime minister for breaching the Conflict of Interest Act. It is Trudeau’s third trip down that road, and it will produce his third slap on the wrist (following his Aga Khan vacation and SNC-Lavalin controversy). The WE Charity is the most blatant conflict of the three. There is something missing in the Liberal DNA. They are great at preaching transparency and accountability. They campaign on these twin principles. The prime minister advocates them at every opportunity. Yet the Liberals keep acting as though transparency and accountability are guiding principles for everyone except themselves. The Liberals are missing something else. It is the political equivalent of a drug-sniffing dog in the Prime Minister’s Office – an official or (to be on the safe side) officials whose job it is to sniff every proposal that comes into the office for the telltale odour of conflict of interest or other variety of ethical spoilage. We will call this person(s) the Principal Sniffer. If the Principal Sniffer were on the job, she/he/they would have thrown up a stop sign until Trudeau addressed the two questions at the top of this column.  As it is, he had to read it on the front page of the Globe and Mail, and he has been savaged on the TV news. Worse, he has put his minority government in jeopardy. There is no way any of the opposition parties can afford to be seen condoning Liberal equivocation on ethics."
271,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/opinion/editorials/2020/07/10/post-pandemic-waterloo-region-must-change.html,Post-pandemic Waterloo Region must change,['Record EditorialWaterloo Region Record'],"Fri., July 10, 2020","This week Waterloo Region Chair Karen Redman issued a stark warning of what the future holds for this community unless the federal and Ontario governments deliver quick, emergency aid. Tax hikes, service-fee increases, cuts to essential services — they’re all up for grabs, she said, as not only the regional government but the seven other local municipalities struggle to cope with the financial devastation wreaked by COVID-19. And all the time, they must avoid the deficits forbidden by law.  That explains why local governments from this region, having bled tax and fee revenues, have banded together with municipalities across Canada in calling on the federal government to come through with a $10-billion pandemic bailout for local governments. But while there’s an overwhelming case that they should be tossed this financial lifesaver — there must be strings attached to it. Now is the time to do things differently. Now we should embrace what Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge, the four townships and the region itself have consistently and stubbornly rejected — a radical overhaul of local government. The way to achieve this can be found in a special report that was written last year for Ontario Premier Doug Ford and recommended ways to save money while improving life for millions of Ontarians.  After touring the province for months, former Waterloo Region chair Ken Seiling and former senior Ontario bureaucrat Michael Fenn handed Ford a blueprint for transforming 82 upper- and lower-tier municipal governments — including the ones in this region — in a positive way. By the time Ford got the report, however, his popularity had plunged. Aware that municipal reform would rile many vested interests, Ford beat a hasty retreat. The report in its entirety was kept secret. It was wrong for Ford to deny the public information they’d paid for and was in their interest. Suppressing it further would compound that error. While The Record recently received a $960 bill from the provincial government so it can gain access to just part of the report under Ontario’s Freedom of Information law, Ford should show some courage, stop his stonewalling and release it all. The Record will continue to seek disclosure of this report on behalf of taxpayers in this region and throughout Ontario. Aren’t Canadians constantly being told that life after COVID-19 will never be the same? Whether it’s enhanced child care, improved nursing homes, a universal basic income or a new agenda to stop climate change, we’re hearing the country we rebuild should be better than the one we had. The challenge is finding how to fund this new Canada. The nation is mired in the worst recession in generations while the federal government is on track to run the biggest annual deficit in Canadian history — $343.2 billion. Moving forward, every precious public dollar must be spent as efficiently and effectively as possible. The report Ford is keeping hidden could help accomplish this. Given that Waterloo Region is well enough served by a single police service, why does it need seven fire departments? Why is it in the best interest of local residents — as opposed to local politicians and civil servants — to have four library systems, eight sewer and water departments, four building departments and at least five economic development departments in a single region? Amalgamation — that long-dreaded word in some circles — is not the only choice. But the report Premier Ford is sitting on could surely offer other concrete solutions for the financial and service bind that local governments in this region and across Ontario are caught in. If they want help now from Ottawa and Queen’s Park, these local governments should help themselves by embracing, not fighting, reform. And Ford should insist they do."

Somehow, you’ve got to get back down again in one piece. There’s a lesson here for the federal government. After taking Canada to the historic and, frankly scary, twin peaks of deficit-spending and national debt to get through the COVID-19 pandemic, it has to guide us back to safer, more solid terrain. The greatest failing of the fiscal “snapshot” released by federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau on Wednesday is that it doesn’t do this. It doesn’t map out a plan for what’s going to be a very tricky descent.  To be sure, Morneau’s 168-report does a convincing job of showing us why the 2020-21 federal deficit had to hit the $343.2-billion mark — more than 10 times his original, pre-pandemic forecast.  While Canadians may experience a slight dizziness upon learning the federal debt will top $1 trillion — that’s 49.1 per cent of the country’s annual gross domestic product — for the first time ever this year, they should feel reassured all this unprecedented spending was necessary. To save Canadian lives, but also to preserve the Canadian economy from devastation, federal and provincial governments had to lock down the country, which left millions of people unemployed or coping with reduced hours. In the ensuing recession, the federal government lost $71.1 billion in tax revenues. It also ended up holding a $227.9-billion bill for the direct spending and tax measures necessitated by the lockdown crisis.  In taking such extreme actions, the Liberal government kept businesses alive, preserved jobs and prevented families from losing their homes. Trouble is, no Canadian government can keep spending at this rate indefinitely, and Minister Morneau knows it.  The federal debt load is  manageable, thanks to today’s low interest rates. But we can’t keep piling on more debt indefinitely without risking serious credit downgrades that will leave Canadians paying cripplingly high debt-servicing costs. Clearly, Canada has to get down from the deficit-debt mountain top it’s precariously perched on today. To do this Ottawa needs to wind back some of the pandemic spending while playing an essential role in the economic recovery. It will have to be choosy. It will also have to work closely with the provinces on many initiatives.  To start, and considering how difficult it will be for many parents, especially women, to return to or continue with their jobs, the Liberals need a plan to expand daycare. This should arrive before schools reopen, rather than after. Next, the Liberals need to provide assistance to retrain workers whose jobs have been lost to COVID-19. Federal incentives to encourage entrepreneurs to start new businesses could help fill the economic gaps left by businesses that have closed. When it’s safe, Canada should re-open its doors to the immigrants who can build new lives in this country as they help rebuild its economy. And because the pandemic hammered international trade — Canadian exports experienced an “unparalleled drop” in April — this is the perfect time to break down the interprovincial trade barriers that still hamper the movement of goods and services within this country. Finally, and this could prove unpopular, the federal government will have to seriously consider some kind of tax increase to help pay for the recovery. An increase in the GST — a consumption tax — might be the fairest way to do this. It was good to see the government’s fiscal “snapshot” of where Canada stands today. Next up, it should provide a detailed picture of where we’re headed."

He faces 22 charges after a truck loaded with guns crashed through the gates of the Ottawa residence of both Canada’s governor general and prime minister. But it will require neither judge nor jury to find the federal government guilty of failing to properly protect two of this country’s most important leaders. While it’s chilling to consider what might have happened, it beggars belief to realize what actually occurred and how massive a threat it posed to human life and national stability. Exactly one week ago — July 2 — an intruder driving a Dodge Ram pickup truck tore through the fence at Rideau Hall at 6:30 a.m., then walked to a nearby greenhouse, allegedly carrying at least one weapon.  For more than 10 minutes, the intruder roamed the grounds, apparently unchallenged. At 6:45 a.m., RCMP officers located him and began talking to him. An hour and 45 minutes later, he was taken into custody. Later Hurren, a 46-year-old Manitoban, was charged with a variety of serious offences that involve weapons and uttering threats. It was fortunate, to say the least, that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his family and Gov.-Gen. Julie Payette were not at their Rideau Hall residences when this egregious security breach happened. The RCMP allege the intruder carried a high capacity magazine and four loaded firearms. In addition, police allege the suspect threatened “to cause death or bodily harm to” Trudeau.  Canadians need to know how all this could have happened. Then they need to see evidence that new and robust security measures will be put in place to ensure nothing like it occurs again. Why was it so easy for a simple pickup truck to make it through the physical barrier surrounding the homes of the governor-general and the prime minister? There’s no reason to suspect this was part of an elaborate conspiracy involving several people. It didn’t take explosives to get through that fence — just one person and a vehicle like the one millions of Canadians drive every day. And why, once the intruder got past that barrier, did it take police so long to find him? It’s virtually certain there’s some kind of closed circuit television and other electronic monitoring at Rideau Hall. Yet whatever protective system the RCMP employs, security expert Wesley Wark, a University of Toronto professor emeritus, observes, “It seems like a slow timeline of response in … this incident.” That’s putting it mildly. This isn’t the first time in recent years a prime minister of Canada has faced a serious threat, either. In October 2014, a gunman was shot dead after murdering a Canadian soldier at the National War Memorial and attacking Parliament Hill’s Centre Block, where then-prime minister Stephen Harper was working. You’d think that after that frighteningly close call, the federal government and the federal police force would have effectively reviewed all the security measures afforded to Canada’s prime minister and governor general. You’d expect any security holes would have been filled. The events of last Thursday strongly suggest you’d be wrong. The country owes far more to its head of government — the prime minister — and its governor general, who serves vital state and ceremonial functions. They should not have to fear for their lives or the lives of loved ones as they fulfil their duties to Canada. But the country owes more to itself, too. In shielding our leaders and their homes, we guard the democratic institutions that are part of the lifeblood of this nation."

They were never consulted in the decision, more than four years ago, to bring the statues of Canada’s prime ministers to the grounds of Castle Kilbride, a museum in Baden. And earlier this week, Wilmot residents were excluded again when they were shut out of two township council meetings in which it was discussed what to do with the statues, now that one of them has been repeatedly defaced with red paint. Council met on Monday and Tuesday, but those meetings were closed to the public. And although the township said that no decisions would be made by council at these meetings, that’s not really true.  There was at least one decision, announced right after Tuesday’s meeting. Wilmot Township will have consultations about the defaced statue of Sir John A. Macdonald. This will take place with Indigenous people, other marginalized communities, the public and the people who donated the statue. “Invitations will be extended to stakeholders to address such topics as the impact of the statue, reconciliation, options and desired outcomes,” said a statement from the township. In other words, township council is now open to considering new ideas, such as removing the statue of Sir John A. Macdonald from the collection on the grounds of the township offices, or possibly moving all five statues to an indoor space. Otherwise, it seems to me, councillors wouldn’t be going out of their way to invite the opinions of people who specifically have requested such changes. That’s a change of direction on the part of council that absolutely should have been discussed and decided in public. I asked every elected township councillor to comment on this. The only response I received was from Jenn Pfenning, who told me on Twitter that “we are committed to listening before making decisions.” Coun. Angie Hallman gave notice of motion June 22 to take a pause on adding new statues to the project until after there are community consultations. The vote on this is scheduled for July 13. But councillors have clearly already decided what they’re doing. At this private meeting, they were even discussing who they should connect with for the consultations. And after the private meeting was over, they announced a decision that they haven’t even voted on yet. What kind of democracy is this? Hallman earlier defended the closed meetings as a chance for councillors to “authentically share our feelings” about recent events in the township. “We needed to have these honest discussions about what was on the agenda,” she said. But why can’t the councillors be authentic and honest when the public is watching? Isn’t that what you sign up for, when you run for elected office? Meanwhile, the municipality assured its residents that the Municipal Act allows for meetings to be held without the public being invited. So it does. There is justification for limited exceptions to the rule of open meetings. If you’re deciding whom to hire as your new chief administrative officer, it’s unreasonable to publicly broadcast the pros and cons of each candidate. If you’re getting sensitive legal advice, it makes sense not to tell the world about it. But what Wilmot council did on Monday and Tuesday does not pass the sniff test. “When in doubt, open the meeting,” says a guide for municipalities from the Ontario Ombudsman, which also investigates complaints of meetings that are improperly closed. The Ombudsman also advises that a meeting could be partially closed for some information to be received, but then opened for the rest of the discussion. One of the things the council did in its private meetings was discuss followup from the statement of apology given by Mayor Les Armstrong, who had shared a controversial and deeply upsetting video on Facebook, alleging the Black Lives Matter movement is a hoax. Armstrong has since taken the video down and apologized several times. On June 26, at the last Wilmot council meeting that was open to the public, he was whacked like a pinata as the public and fellow councillors criticized his judgment. Some asked him to resign.  Armstrong said he wouldn’t resign, but would learn to do better. He pledged to arrange and pay for his own training. His council colleagues will receive quarterly reports on his progress. But his fellow councillors weren’t done. In the private council meetings this week, there was a “frank and heartfelt exchange” as councillors described their personal experiences since the original post, and community feedback they have received. The township says these discussions fell under the clause allowing for “personal matters about an identifiable individual” to be discussed privately. It was explained to me later that there were members of the public whose names and experiences were part of the discussion, but which needed to be kept confidential. Councillors, that is not a good reason to close two full meetings. If someone complaining about Armstrong’s behaviour needs to have his or her identity kept secret because of safety or privacy concerns, either close the meeting for a few minutes to talk about that one individual, or don’t use identifying information about that person. Ultimately, let’s not forget that the mayor works for all the people of Wilmot.  If anyone is entitled to a frank and heartfelt discussion of his behaviour, it is the people of Wilmot. They need to make sure he is able to represent them properly. They need to understand the damage in the community that was caused by his actions. Neither of those things can happen when they have the door to the meeting shut in their faces."

Since about 81 per cent of Canadians live in cities/urban areas, we need to talk about this. We are never going back to “normal.” Normal wasn’t working very well anyway. As we carefully reopen our cities, we need to equally address our environment, equality, our community health and our economy.  I don’t know what it looks like now, but my ideal for a city is based on when I lived car-free in a triplex on a tree-lined side-street half a block north of The Lakeshore in southern Etobicoke. The street was a mixture of small apartment buildings, single-family homes, a few triplexes, three churches and a very odd semi-underground building for the Independent Order of Oddfellows. The streetcar stop was at the corner, and I could walk to work or Lake Ontario in about 15 minutes. Every once in a while a parade would inexplicably come down our street. Also within a 15-minute walking radius were an independent grocery store, clothing store, fresh produce store, Polish deli, post office, my bank, drugstore, liquor store, fairly good bar, hardware store, really good Italian restaurant, great greasy spoon for breakfast, and even a second-run movie theatre. A highlight for me was being able to carry our new couch home from the furniture store around the corner. Schools and several large manufacturing companies were nearby; downtown Toronto was just a streetcar ride away. Our cities have to be welcome, resilient, sustainable and livable for everyone. Even though they make up only two per cent of the world’s land mass, cities consume 66 per cent of the world’s energy and produce 70 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the C40 Cities organization. We need national targets to reduce our carbon output, and our cities need to pick up the pace. Change is hard work, and trying to drum up political will is frustrating. Former MP Marlene Jennings once shared a great metaphor. She said that making policy changes at a federal level was like trying to turn around an ocean liner; at a municipal level, it’s more like turning around a canoe. Although our municipal governments are the creatures of our provincial government, they have a huge impact on our daily lives, managing and funding everything from airports to water and sewage. Both The Association of Municipalities of Ontario and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities are great resources to understand their responsibilities. Who pays for all of this? We do. For example, 38 per cent of The Region of Waterloo’s 2020 Budget is from private and business property taxes, 27 per cent from provincial and federal grants, and 16 per cent is from user fees such as parking tickets. Our role, as citizens, is to stay engaged with local politicians, to ensure a carbon-neutral future. And we’ve been talking about the kind of changes we need for a very, very long time. Almost 20 years ago, Gil Penalosa shared his expertise at a Walkable Bikeable Waterloo Forum. As the founder of 8 80 Cities and former parks commissioner for Bogota, Columbia, Penalosa successfully increased parkland and trails and introduced car-free days in that city. Penalosa moved to Toronto with 8 80 Cities and is still working to “enhance mobility and public space so that together we can create more vibrant, healthy, and equitable communities … that we can grow up in and grow old in.” His practical solutions included lowering city speed limits to 30 km/h, allowing only pedestrian and bike traffic on certain streets, scramble intersections so all pedestrians cross at the same time, more tables and umbrellas on the street, dedicated bike lanes, and more. He also said that buildings should never be taller than about eight storeys high — high enough to optimize population density, but not too high that you lose connection to the street. With a growing population, we definitely do NOT want to spread sideways and threaten our protected countryside line. Our living spaces must meet the needs of the young and old and everyone in between. Why not Babayagas for senior women, tiny homes or even year-round trailer parks for starter homes? What about co-housing? We can’t go back to normal. We need a better balance between our environmental, community health, and economic needs. We have to start where we live."

And in the seismic moment after George Floyd’s death in police custody, North American cities have erupted with the kind of mass protests unseen since the civil rights movement of the ’60s. Kitchener, in true Canadian fashion, staged a kinder, gentler rally of its own last week, drawing thousands of masked protesters to march peacefully along city streets, throwing garbage into conveniently located bins on the sidewalk. But what happens when the flames die down, public interest wanes and everyone goes back to their tedious, pandemic-confined lives?  Does racism become a thing of the past? Or does everyone tire of the subject and move on to the next social-media outrage? Waterloo Region is lucky to have a cache of articulate, passionate activists with lived experience willing to speak truth to power. But there’s sadness, frustration — often palpable — and impatience with those who don’t “get” that anti-Black racism isn’t some new issue that just emerged in the last two weeks. In today’s spotlight: Christopher Taylor, the author/Black history prof recently named University of Waterloo’s Anti-Black Racism Adviser; and Ruth Cameron, community leader/doctoral student/executive director of the AIDS Committee of Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo and Area. Their comments below are scathing, blunt and, in some cases, darkly ironic, because after 400 years of struggle, gallows humour may be the only refuge. On a personal level, how are you two holding up? Cameron: I’m a queer Black woman who’s a mother and a leader. I’m seen as a resource, so I have to make sure I focus on radical self-care. We’re trying to live while we’re in active grief. Taylor: I’m getting a lot of messages from concerned white folks. I might just start resorting to cutting and pasting a Black-faced smiling emoji. Searing images of burned out storefronts, militant police lines and tear gassed protesters have plunged U.S. cities into chaos and sparked protests in Canada. Is this a pressure valve being released or just more racial tension you didn’t ask for? Taylor: Black folks are asking for life and basic human rights and the response is to quell it with state controlled violence, which is the language of white supremacy. Cameron: Yo, it’s full on fascism, folks. Stay ready. Also, take a very close look at what’s happening in political spheres close to home. Not just every four years, but All. The. Time. I want to remind people that the Montreal police used tear gas on people (last) week, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Is this a bellwether “MeToo” moment in which the world changes in an instant, or one in a long line of momentary blips that will ultimately achieve nothing? Taylor: From the conversations I’m hearing, and what I’m seeing on social and mainstream media, folks are not about real change. They’re about feeding that guilt hunger through Black pain. So it’s going to be a lot of tears, then by Canada Day weekend — if things “open-up” a bit more — it’s going to be business as usual. White folks at the cottage in their Birkenstocks.  You’ve seen this scenario play out before.  Taylor: People like to go back to the 1960s, but conveniently like to forget Ferguson (where police shot an unarmed Black teenager) six years ago. Or Rodney King or the Yonge St. uprising in 1992. White collective memory when it comes to race and racism is like a goldfish trying to remember where it parked the car. Cameron: Black people are killed every day by systemic anti-Black racism. It’s not rare. It’s a constant backdrop in Black lives.  So why has Floyd’s death sparked such a prolonged and heated response? Taylor: Because we’re in a global pandemic with a U.S. government that would do anything to distract the masses from the fact they have the highest positive case load in the world and by far the most deaths.  So it’s the intersection of Donald Trump, COVID-19, warm weather, 400 years of racism and one Black death too many?  Taylor: Folks are now paying attention because they have nothing else to do. They got tired of baking and Instagram fitness challenges. I get the cynicism, but am I wrong in saying this time feels different? Cameron: What differs now is the tone of our calls to action. The young people I mentor and work with aren’t interested in incremental change. This is no call for reform. We want completely different ways of doing things. If the system you’ve created is hurting me, I’m not going to say “harm me just a little less.” I want it to end. Black people are rising up to claim our humanity. Christopher, you described Floyd’s death as a modern-day lynching. Taylor: What a lot of folks fail to realize is that lynching in the U.S. and Canada was a spectacle. Just like how we would go to the movies, white folks would go and see that n***** swinging off a tree like Strange Fruit. They would even take pieces off the deceased human as a souvenir. So when white folks watch the video of a Black man being killed, they really need to ask why? Might be to feed their curiosity, blood lust, guilt. Whatever it is, it ends up being a form of entertainment. And for you? Taylor: I don’t watch the videos. Seeing this Black man getting killed is a mirror to my own mortality. What about Regis Korchinski-Paquet, the Afro-Indigenous woman who fell 24 storeys to her death in the presence of Toronto police? Cameron: Her body was left out for six hours before her remains were taken away. George Floyd was slowly murdered on camera for nine minutes by a police officer who casually kept his hands in his pockets. The manner in which Black people are killed and our remains displayed is an intentional message that we are disposable.  I’m parroting a refrain from the chattering class: surely morally superior Canada is above all this. Taylor: Canada just loves to point the finger at the U.S. Meanwhile, it allows us to change the channel on the fact our government has failed its own — white — citizens. How can we expect white folks to care about Black people when they don’t even care about their own parents and grandparents dying/murdered in long-term care homes? Where were those protests? How effective has the media been in cutting through the hype? Taylor: White media should be asking white police officers and politicians why they think it’s OK to defend the killing of a Black man. They should be asking white folks about white supremacy and not how they feel about Black people. Cameron: I’m aware how hard individual journalists have to fight with editors to capitalize the ‘B’ in Black, to frame our issues as “systemic” versus individual isolated events, to ask hard questions instead of “Hey Ruth, how is this stuff making you feel?” I’m grateful for that. But mainstream media has a lot of catching up to do, to communicate where Black communities are now. Incremental change is not OK.  White liberals are outraged by Floyd’s death, pledging solidarity and support on social media. Given the lack of historic follow-through, there’s a stench of hypocrisy. Taylor: I’m all for raising awareness. I think that’s a real key in any kind of change movement. But let’s be real for a second: when was the last time a hashtag prevented a murder or an assault? Or impacted the climate we live in? Are sexual assaults at zero on university campuses after the #MeToo movement? Cameron: There is absolutely NO point in making any statements unless they contain a clearly defined commitment to an action. Black cultures are all about accountability. I also hear grumbling from older white men about what they perceive as an angry, resentful tone when marginalized voices take the podium. They want a more “nuanced” conversation.  Taylor: I think they need to go sit in the back of the class, shut up and listen. They take up too much space. Did I provide enough “nuance” or did I just fall in the trap of the indignant and “angry Black man?” Cameron: “Civility” and “nuance” are strategies used by some white people to deflect when Black people express that we’re living in constant harm. Taylor: What these older white men or SWAMs — Straight White Able-Bodied Men — fail to realize is that when they speak up and ask for a “fairer” or more “nuanced” conversation, they actually mean that they want the conversation to fall within parameters they control, that they dictate, that fall under their terms and in language they understand. What can all the self-professed allies who have suddenly popped out of the woodwork do to make a difference? Taylor: There’s no blueprint for white folks to follow. It’s like teaching a lion to be a vegan. If there’s one thing I would suggest, it’s to understand that this s*** happens every day. Black bodies are being killed and there’s no hashtag or protest. Just because it’s not popping up on your social media feed — your echo chamber of a fabricated reality — doesn’t mean it’s not happening all the time. Cameron: Donate to organizations that are Black-led and serve Black people. Hire multiple Black people, rather than individual tokens. Interrupt racism and amplify Black decision-making leadership within your organizations. Stop consolidating power and hoarding resources. Share and hand over. Even in Waterloo Region, a serenely insulated multicultural nirvana? Taylor: We don’t live in a vacuum. We wake up for the “sensational deaths,” but anti-Black racism permeates all facets of society. Black kids being followed in stores; not being called on in class; the liberal use of the ‘N-word’ by white folks; the co-opting of Black voices for political gain. These are all functions of the same system that killed George Floyd. Cameron: Black people in Waterloo Region are subjected to targeted policing surveillance in neighbourhoods like Chandler-Mowat and Kingsdale, the school resource officer program and the Community Outreach Program (COPs). This must end now, and those financial resources must be given to the Black community to administer. These programs are run by “allies,” are they not? Taylor: I’m always wary of institutions that co-opt the language of the oppressed, stand as “allies,” but actually and deliberately choose not to make change. The FBI knew that folks wanted to kill Malcolm X, and when they would do it, but they didn’t stop them. Why not?"

First question: Will Donald Trump — “the world’s most dangerous man,” according to his niece, a clinical psychologist — run for re-election as president of the United States in November? Second question: Can grandfatherly Democrat Joe Biden — as amiable as he is uninspiring — defeat the most unpopular president in decades? The first question may seem silly. Of course, Trump will run again. He is a stable genius. He is infallible. Not even fake news can stop him. He is No. 1 on Facebook. His adoring base will make him president again. He knows these things. The answer to the second question should also be yes, shouldn’t it? Biden may be too old (78 in November), a relic, but that doesn’t matter. The former vice-president is polling eight to 10 points ahead of Trump; he leads in the battleground states of 2016, and, if the numbers hold, he’ll be known as Landslide Joe. Maybe. But let’s wait and see. Let’s start with Trump. There were signs last week of unease in Donald’s World (not to be confused with Disney World, which is the real thing). It wasn’t just the publication of the family tell-all book by niece Mary Trump, which soared to the top of the bestseller lists before it could be shipped to bookstores.  The White House was also shaken by a remarkable article by Carl Bernstein — he of Watergate fame — that was published by CNN online. Applying his formidable investigative skills to dig into Trump’s dealings with foreign leaders, Bernstein reported that the president does not bother to read briefing material or listen to his advisers before telephone calls with other leaders. He regularly panders to Russian President Vladimir Putin, boasts to Saudi royalty about his own wealth, and bullies the leaders of America’s best friends, telling they are weak, stupid, fools and losers. (Yes, Justin Trudeau is among the abused.) The next blow came in a report by Fox News — of all people — that Trump is in a “fragile” mood and may drop out of the election. Republican insiders are disposed to be more candid with friendly Fox than with other news organizations, and the network quoted one of them as saying, “It’s too early, but if the polls continue to worsen, you can see a scenario where he drops out.” The polls are bad and worsening, as Trump’s approval rating is driven down both by his handling of the coronavirus crisis and by his reaction to Black Lives Matter. A Washington Post poll put his approval/disapproval rating at 36/62 while a New York Times poll put it at 38/58.  His electoral support is in decline. It was down to 40 per cent in several polls last week and dipped to 39 per cent in a few of them. In American politics, 40 per cent is considered a warning shot across the bow of an incumbent president while 35 per cent spells disaster.  The last two presidents who sank to 35 were Jimmy Carter in 1980 and the first George Bush in 1992. Carter lost to Ronald Reagan and Bush to Bill Clinton. There were even rumours last week that Vice-President Mike Pence might not run again. All this should be good news for Joe Biden, but the Democrats have reasons to worry. One of them is money. Trump has been building a war chest ever since the 2016 election and, his disapproval rating notwithstanding, he raised a record $131 million in June. According to his re-election campaign manager, Brad Parscale, Trump has 1.3 million volunteers trained and ready to go. Also according to Parscale, Trump will not be running as an incumbent president with a record to defend. He will run as he did four years ago — as an outsider taking on the Washington establishment, as conveniently represented by career politician Biden, an establishment insider for 47 years. Can Trump pull it off again? I wonder."
278,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/opinion/contributors/2020/07/05/in-canada-it-matters-who-has-jurisdiction-and-who-does-not.html,"In Canada, it matters who has jurisdiction and who does not",['John Milloy'],"Sun., July 5, 2020","As Canada emerges from COVID-19, our public policy to-do list is very long: long-term care; precarious workers; systemic racism in policing and other institutions; jobs; and poverty — to name just a few. Justin Trudeau better step up — right? Get with the program, people. Canada is a federation in which responsibilities are divided between different levels of government and responsibility for much of the list presented above lies with the provinces. So why is the knee-jerk reaction of many Canadians, particularly Ontarians, to turn to Ottawa instead of Queen’s Park to solve every problem? There are a few obvious answers. From childhood, we are taught that the prime minister is Canada’s boss and trying to understand the nuances of federalism is about as interesting as watching paint dry.  Then there is the fact that federal politicians often enjoy mucking about in areas of provincial responsibility because they are often more high-profile and politically sexy, like Trudeau’s bizarre recent promise to ensure 10 paid sick days for all workers in Canada. Although it sounds like a good proposal, other than in a few narrow instances, labour standards are a provincial responsibility.  “So what,” you may say. “Other than undermining boring constitutional niceties, why is it a bad thing for Ottawa to browbeat the provinces into submission on important issues like sick leave, more hospitals or improved long-term care? What if Ottawa is prepared to put money on the table?” Let me offer three reasons why we should be wary of Ottawa getting involved in provincial business. First, provincial governments understand their systems, their players and what is or isn’t possible.  Second, provinces know where the need is the greatest — which doesn’t always align with the loudest voice or the highest-profile proposals.  Third is the issue of accountability. The federal government might get involved in an area of provincial jurisdiction, but it is the folks in the provincial legislature who are answerable for it. Federal involvement can put them in an impossible situation. What if the federal government didn’t invest enough to achieve the promised ends? What if the federal initiative demanded matching dollars that the province would have rather invested elsewhere? Provincial governments are not always innocent victims. As a former provincial politician, I remember trying to blame Ottawa for provincial shortcomings in an effort to divert attention and extort needed federal dollars. These games are not necessarily helpful. Although there is plenty of room for federal-provincial co-operation and revenue sharing, there appears to be enough work to go around for each level of government to concentrate on its own set of responsibilities. Of course, there is an elephant in the room. What if you don’t like your provincial government? Like many, I was upset when the Ford government eliminated paid sick leave for many Ontario workers. Although part of me would love to see Ottawa force Ontario’s hand, I also recognize that Doug Ford has a mandate from the people of Ontario and it is up to us to pressure Queen’s Park for change.  Discussions about federalism might seem out of place in a world that appears to have imploded. But think about it: as we make plans to dig ourselves out of this mess, isn’t the logical first step to figure out who is in charge of what?"
279,The Record,https://www.therecord.com/opinion/contributors/2020/06/28/delays-in-meng-extradition-process-put-the-two-michaels-in-increased-peril.html,Delays in Meng extradition process put the two Michaels in increased peril,['Geoffrey StevensContributing Columnist'],"Sun., June 28, 2020","Justice delayed is justice denied, as the old saying goes. But that’s only the half of it in the Meng Wanzhou extradition case.  In the Meng case, fraught as it is with international political implications, justice delayed is downright dangerous. With pressure growing almost daily, the delay endangers the futures, even the lives, of Canadians Michael Kovrig, a diplomat on leave, and businessperson Michael Spavor, who are incarcerated in China.  Official denials notwithstanding, the Meng affair has, from the beginning, been as much political as it has been legal.  The U.S. case against Meng, the chief financial officer (and daughter of the founder) of Huawei Technologies, had its origins in a 2013 transaction between Huawei and the international bank HSBC. In the course of applying for a $1.5 billion (U.S.) loan, Meng, it is alleged, made false statements that understated Huawei’s relationship with Skycom Tech. Co., an Iran-based company controlled by Huawei. As U.S. authorities saw it, Meng’s statements constituted fraud and were intended to evade American sanctions against Iran. On Aug. 22, 2018, a New York court issued a warrant for the arrest of Meng, who had been living in Vancouver. The United States requested her extradition under a Canada-U.S. extradition treaty. On Dec. 1, 2018, Meng was arrested as she passed through the airport in Vancouver. This news became public on Dec. 5. China demanded her release the next day. On Dec. 7, she appeared in court in Vancouver to hear the charges read against her. Three days later, China arrested the two Michaels. On Dec. 11, with Meng freed on $10-million bail, Trump raised the stakes from simply legal to highly political. He told Reuters that he would “certainly intervene” in Meng’s case “if I thought it was necessary” to help forge a trade deal with China. In other words, he was prepared to use her as a bargaining chip. At that point, Ottawa might have used the introduction of this political dimension, plus the fact that Canada was not a party to the Iran sanctions, as reasonable grounds to abandon the extradition effort, a step that might — and I emphasize “might” — have prompted China to release Kovrig and Spavor.  The minister of justice has the authority to intervene at any stage to halt an extradition proceeding, but the government, undoubtedly fearful of antagonizing the mercurial and twitchy Trump, chose not to intervene then or at any subsequent stage as the process dragged on and on — through 2019 and into 2020. Any hope that the B.C. Supreme Court would get the federal government off the Meng hook evaporated last month when Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes ruled that the allegation that Meng had lied to HSBC in 2013 would, if proved, constitute a crime in Canada and was, therefore, enough to allow the extradition to proceed.  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — acting on valid concerns about encouraging hostage-taking — has hardened the government’s position. He rejects all suggestions that the government stop the extradition and, in effect, exchange Meng’s liberty for the release of the two Michaels.  Meng is due back in court on Aug. 17 in proceedings destined to continue into 2021. They may well, some experts say, stretch to 2024 — leaving the fates of the two Canadians hanging in the balance. It seems ridiculous to this layman that extradition proceedings are allowed — even encouraged — to drag on so long. Parliament could amend the 1999 Extradition Act to build in time limits. When an application for extradition is received, is there any reason why the act could not stipulate that the application be heard within, say, one month and that a decision be rendered within one additional month. Could the appeal process, which can extend all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, not be drastically shortened or even eliminated? Changes now would not help with the exceptional Meng case, but they might prevent future extraditions from escalating the way Meng has."
