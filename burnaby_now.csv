Vince Li wants to have a word with you about that. The 26-year-old had been battling a fever for several days back in March when he made his way to Burnaby Hospital looking for answers.

The results of an X-ray and blood test revealed tell-tale signs of COVID-19. Doctors decided to immediately sedate, intubate, and send Li to Royal Columbian Hospital, one of the province’s primary COVID-19 sites. There, he became the youngest COVID-positive patient to be mechanically ventilated in the hospital’s intensive care unit during the pandemic’s spring peak, according to the RCH foundation.

“I didn’t have a chance to tell anybody,” Li recalls after hearing he would be placed in an induced coma. “My mom was outside at the waiting area in the ER, and social workers called her.”

“His blood levels of oxygen were ridiculously low, so he needed quite a lot of oxygen to support him,” said Dr. Robert Sharpe, a critical care physician at RCH. “His carbon dioxide levels were also quite high. It was quite difficult to blow off CO2 because his lungs were greatly inflamed from the body’s reaction to the virus. He was pretty touch and go early on.”

A personal trainer and competitive mixed-martial artist who controlled his type 2 diabetes through diet and exercise, Li remained hospitalized for a month and remembers nothing about the first three weeks. During that time, ICU teams kept a close watch on his blood gases, made sure his organs were getting enough oxygen, and watched for signs of new infections.

Since there is no specific treatment yet for COVID-19, patients are supported medically in the hopes they can fight off the virus.

“He fooled us a couple of times, where we thought he was ready to come off the ventilator,” said Sharpe. “And then we just needed to give him more time, and he turned around.”

When he regained consciousness, Li was surprised at the amount of weight and muscle he lost. It took him a while to start moving comfortably again.

“In the beginning, it was pretty rough,” he said. “I didn’t realize that being in a bed for a month, I could have so much muscle atrophy.”

While his time at Royal Columbian is hazy, Li says the care – from the doctors to the nurses and physiotherapists – stands out, as does other, simpler milestones.

“My fondest memory was getting the tubes out of my nose and eating actual food for the first time in a month,” Li said. “That felt pretty good.”",[]

Just how much value? Well, apartment buyers have paid 4.5-per-cent above assessed value on average for units near a SkyTrain station between March 15 and May 31, 2020, according to a report by Vancouver-based real estate marketing and analytics firm Roomvu.

The report, which compared the sold price of apartments to government assessed values, found apartments in some Metro Vancouver areas sold at the highest rates above assessed value - 6, 5.6 and 5 per cent respectively. While the lowest discrepancy between sold price and assessed value was in Richmond at 2.3 per cent.

“Access to transit has become valuable over the course of time. Prices of transit-friendly homes rose over the course of the year in spite of the far-reaching negative economic consequences of the pandemic,” said Thomas Davidoff, economist and professor at UBC’s Sauder School of Business. “Social distancing measures have undeniably made selling a home more difficult, as hosting open-houses and in-person tours have become difficult or impossible. That said, we still continue to see a very strong relationship between price point and sales performance, both in terms of sales to listings and price relative to assessment.”

“Looking at the difference between sold prices and government assessed value paints a more accurate picture of market activity than looking at price alone,” said Sam Merhbod, a Vancouver-area realtor and CEO at Roomvu. “COVID-19 has certainly dealt a blow to Vancouver’s real estate market overall, but the apartment segment is showing some signs of recovery,” he added.",[]

Like the dangers of being a pedestrian in the Cardston Court area of Burnaby.

article continues below

Cardston is located just south of Lougheed Highway near Lougheed Town Centre and I lived for several years at the corner of Cardston and Government Street, next to Keswick Park.

This was the scene of a wild rollover crash that saw a pedestrian get hit and I wasn’t the least bit surprised.

Neither was Vicki Sanderson, who brought the crash to my attention to raise awareness about how dangerous this area is for pedestrians, cyclists and even other drivers.

“(The driver) lost control of his vehicle, hit a parked car, which ended up in the park, but not before hitting a young woman walking her dog,” Sanderson said.

And this wasn’t the first incident, only the most recent. Two weeks ago, Sanderson saw another scary incident.

“A speeding car coming down Cardston Court saw a green light, turned left and hit a woman in the crosswalk. This is not unusual on this street - speeding and reckless driving is a huge problem. We have many families who walk these streets down to the park and how long before we have a fatality? Small children and speeding cars? What can the city do? Speed bumps? Seriously needs some consideration.”

I wouldn’t hold my breath for speed bumps. Usually, those have to be resident-initiated and it’s hard to get people to sign a petition.

But it really is a bad area, mainly due to all the ratrunners on Government trying to avoid Lougheed. This stretch also has some steep turns and drivers floor it after they cross Lougheed. The lanes are also really narrow because their are usually vehicles parked on either side of Cardston.

These lanes are pretty unforgiving.

I saw so much of that around 1990 when I lived there and it’s sad to think that things have actually gotten worse in the area.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians.

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

What to look out for

The BBB says consumers should look out for the following red flags is they are searching for a lender or loan broker:

The health authority added the outbreak of C. difficile to its list of current outbreaks on July 14.

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Rash

If you are visiting someone who is located on an outbreak unit, visitors may be limited to two people at a time. Fraser Health asks that you do not visit other patient rooms or common areas on the unit such as the lounge and patient kitchenette. It also recommends you don’t visit public areas in the hospital such as the cafeteria and gift shop.",[]

Hate-fuelled graffiti on the home of a Summerland family. Systemic racism and sexism, both overt and covert, at all levels of society.

Prejudice is indeed pandemic. Bigotry is a virus. And we all have the potential to be hosts (even those of us from racialized minorities).

We’re not born with it in our blood. It’s transmitted from person to person. From family to family. It’s learned through conversations, comments, jokes, judgements, looks, books, micro-aggressions, political rhetoric, insults, attitudes, ignorance, and even classroom lesson plans.

It infects entire institutions to the point where everyone within the organization becomes immune to biased hiring practices, offensive language, token diversity, racial and religious profiling, and exclusive, patriarchal power structures.

And like COVID-19, it won’t just go away on its own. We have to track it and attack it. We have to trace it, isolate it, and call it out. By name. Persistently. We have to propose anti-racist policies, pass anti-racist laws, and push for anti-racist consequences.

We have to stop passively and proudly saying we’re not racist. And we have to start actively and loudly being anti-racist. We have to listen to those with lived experience.

We have to hold elected officials (and each other) accountable. We have to. And we can.

The world has changed dramatically over the last two months, since George Floyd took his last breath on May 25, 2020. In many ways, the globe has gotten smaller, as evidenced by the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (with about 13.5 million cases worldwide and over 580,000 deaths and rising), and the massive outpouring of protesters on city streets from Vancouver to Sydney screaming that Black Lives Matter.

No matter what language we speak or what corner of the Earth we inhabit, “social distancing” has become a part of our everyday vocabulary and behaviour.

Yet science has proven that all human beings – regardless of colour, class, culture, gender, or sexual orientation – are inextricably linked like never before.

As the motto goes, we’re all in this together. Overnight, we’ve all become armchair epidemiologists. Following the lead of our Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbians have sacrificed and worked hard to flatten the curve of COVID-19.

Complacency is not an option. We can’t afford to go backwards. And we must be equally vigilant and aggressive to finally squash the scourge of white supremacy, police brutality, systemic racism, and hatred in all its insidious forms.

Silence is no longer acceptable. We’re in a pandemic. And lives are at stake.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

Starting in early 2014, Patrick Fox set out on a campaign to make the life of his ex-wife, Desiree Capuano “as miserable as possible, hoping to drive her to suicide if that could be done within the confines of the law,” according to B.C. Supreme Court documents.

article continues below

He created a website in her name, posting private information about her and people associated with her, maligning her as a white supremacist, drug addict and child abuser.

“Mr. Fox tormented Ms. Capuano in every way he could, taking considerable time and effort to do so,” stated a Nov. 10, 2017 sentencing decision by B.C. Supreme Court Justice Heather Holmes.

A jury had found Fox guilty in June 2017 of criminal harassment and weapons charges.

(Fox had shipped four handguns, ammunition and a disassembled Mauser rifle illegally to the U.S., where Capuano lives.)

He was sentenced to three years and 10 months in jail, minus just over two years for time he had already served.

He was also given three years of probation, during which he was banned from contacting or publishing information about Capuano or her friends and relatives.

He was also banned from using the internet except for the purpose of employment or sending personal emails and forbidden to leave B.C. or get within 100 metres of the U.S. border.

Fox has already been found guilty of breaking two of those conditions by leaving the province and being within 100 metres of the U.S. border on March 19, 2019, according to court documents.

He was sentenced last month to one day in jail (after spending eight months in pretrial custody) and to another 18 months of probation for those breaches.

He was back in court this week to face charges for two more alleged breaches between March 7 and March 21, 2019, during which time he is alleged to have accessed the internet and made another website, www.desicapuano.com, publicly available.

A one-day trial was scheduled in Vancouver provincial court Wednesday, but Fox, who is representing himself in the case and appeared via video link from the North Fraser Pretrial Centre, requested an adjournment so he could appear in person to cross-examine the prosecution’s only witness, a police detective.

Fox was not in court because someone on his unit had tested positive for COVID-19.

Judge James Bahen agreed to the adjournment but cautioned Fox there was no guarantee the next hearing would be in-person.

“No one, myself included, would take upon themselves the ability to predict the course of the pandemic and whether or not it’s going to be a factor that would affect policies in courts and correctional centres,” Bahen said.

Fox’s trial was rescheduled for Aug. 19.

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

article continues below

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The man and woman, who have asked not to be identified, were taken in by what appeared to be a call from their grandson in dire need of help.

article continues below

“The guy sounded so much like our grandson. If he had said ‘Grandma,’ we’d have known [it wasn’t him] right away, but he said ‘Nan’ and so does my grandson,” said the man.

The imposter grandson, who used their grandson’s name, called on Monday and told them he had been driving a friend’s car and struck a vehicle with Quebec licence plates that had turned sharply in front of him.

The fake grandson went on to say he had been taken to jail, but a judge would free him if he could pay for the damage, estimated to be $5,000. The grandparents were told to send money to the car’s owner in Montreal.

“I wasn’t cluing in at all [that this was a scam], he sounded so much like our grandson,” the man said.

The dutiful grandparents then took cash from their bank and went to the Bank of Montreal and using an account number the scammer had provided via an accomplice posing as a lawyer, they sent money to a BMO branch in downtown Montreal.

“The kid said, ‘Please don’t tell Dad,’ ” the man said. It wasn’t until he later talked to his grandson that it became clear they had been scammed.

The couple has since been in touch with police and the Bank of Montreal, which they say has been very helpful.

“They are doing their best to try and get the money back,” said the man, who thinks the scammers “took a shot in the dark and got lucky.”

But according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, it’s likely the scammers mined information like the grandson’s name from social media to make the pitch more convincing.

The centre calls these types of scams “the emergency scam.” It preys on the fear of a loved one being hurt or in trouble. The scammer claims to be someone you know and says they need money immediately. They tend to use scenarios like needing bail money because they’ve been arrested, or being in a car accident, or having trouble returning from a foreign country.

The targets are often seniors and the scammer pretends to be a grandchild, who begs them not to tell their parents that they’re in trouble, the Anti-Fraud Centre said. As a result, the grandparent doesn’t find out until after they’ve sent the money that their grandchild was not the person who asked for help.

Const. Cam MacIntyre said scammers will go to any lengths to defraud a victim.

“They will pose as a family member, a trusted member of the public, or even the police. We strongly recommend that people never deposit money into accounts of people or entities they do know personally,” he said.

“It’s so important to verify where your money is going. Call a family member, a friend, or the police if you are suspicious.”

The Anti-Fraud Centre says there were 18,803 reports of fraud, and 6,671 victims reporting losses of $22.6 million in Canada in the first four months of this year.

MacIntyre suggests if you are in the process of providing financial information or sending money to potential fraudsters, stop immediately.

“Contact your financial institutions and ensure all payments that you have not authorized are stopped. Inform them of the fraud and change both passwords and access information,” he said.

Suspected frauds can be reported to your local police or the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to put downward pressure on the rental market nationally, with rent declining 9.4 per cent in June, and average monthly rents decreasing in April, May and June.

Such as Barnet Highway. I should know – I’m sure I’ve sped along there as well. You get out of traffic from Hastings on one side and Port Moody on the other and you just feel like letting loose.

But you shouldn’t, of course, and a whole bunch of drivers learned this the hard way on Monday as Burnaby RCMP partnered with Port Moody police for a speed trap.

It was like fish in a barrel as 61 violation tickets were handed out. Most were speeding, as 44 drivers were nailed. Cops also nailed drivers for distracted driving, failing to wear a seatbelt and being caught with cannabis.

This follows a recent speed trap set up on Burnaby Mountain in which traffic officers caught a driver going 110 km/h in a 50 km/h zone, landing this person a whopping $483 ticket and losing their vehicle for a week.

The week before, the Burnaby RCMP’s traffic enforcement unit stung a bunch of reckless speeders on Father’s Day. The officers targeted playground zones to catch speeds ignoring the 30 km/h rules. A total of 20 tickets were handed out and an insane 11 drivers were caught doing more than double the speed limit. In April, police caught a driver treating Burnaby’s Willingdon Avenue like it was the Trans Canada Highway.

The driver was going – get this – 113 km/h in a 50 km/h zone.

I think ICBC should just no longer insure these drivers for a year. This is one way that I’m sure would teach these maniacs a lesson.

People responding to a Burnaby RCMP tweet had other suggestions.

“Can you just imagine what our traffic would be like if there was a law that took away the offender's car? When I was 10, my Dad took 5c out of my allowance for every time a light was left on. I learned quicker than these morons. I so feel for the police. Zero punishment.”

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.'s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a ""second wave"" of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The fiscal and economic report released a week ago detailed the Liberals' financial expectations, including a $343.2-billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Parliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux says in a report that there are other numbers behind the biggest ones that MPs and senators should question.

He points to projections that enterprise Crown corporations, such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. and Business Development Bank of Canada, will collectively lose $12 billion this fiscal year.

Giroux notes that loss is a sharp turnaround from the $7.3 billion in gains for the 12-month period ending in March.

He says losses are unusual for these Crown corporations and adds that each should provide detailed projections to Parliament as soon as possible about its COVID-19 liquidity programs.

Similarly, Giroux says the Liberals should provide details of their own borrowing, which his office estimates will exceed by $150 billion the ceiling set by federal legislation.

The budget office estimates the government's planned debt issuance this fiscal year of $713 billion will cost $2.2 billion annually in interest.

The report released Thursday also notes $4.4 billion in spending for measures the government has yet to announce.

All the spending is expected to push the federal debt past the $1-trillion mark.

The Liberals had previously made a declining debt-to-GDP ratio key to their fiscal plans, but skyrocketing spending will push the ratio to 49 per cent from 31.1 per cent.

Giroux says fiscal transparency and accountability would be enhanced if the Liberals identify their new ""fiscal anchor,"" how they'll measure their own successful handling of the budget and national economy, which wasn't specifically laid out in the update last week.

The money is to help the lower-tier governments with needs such as funding child care, bailing out cities whose expenses have soared and revenues plunged, increasing contact-tracing capacity, and buying personal protective equipment.

The pandemic is a health crisis, but Trudeau says it has a deep economic dimension.

He says workers can't work if their children don't have safe care, and many can't get to their jobs if they don't have access to safe transit systems.

That means funding needed services better so they don't have to rely on crowding many people into small spaces for their finances to make sense.

Dionne says Horbanov's car was otherwise in good condition and he had not consumed any alcohol when he skidded off the road while driving with his family.

""The ruin of the First Nations and peoples of Canada is not just statistics. As seen here, it is real pain,"" Justice Chris Martin said in a written decision delivered July 10.

Anthony McKay was sentenced to four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the death of his mother, Shirley McKay. He faces two years behind bars, after receiving credit for time already served, and will be subject to three years of supervised probation after that.

""As a human, Mrs. McKay deserved better. And, like anyone born in this bountiful country, her son, her killer, deserved a better start, a better chance, in life,"" Martin wrote.

The judge said the killing on the Berens River First Nation, about 300 kilometres north of Winnipeg, was a ""calamity of almost 150 years of government policy, actions and inactions affecting the Indigenous community.""

Anthony McKay, who was 21 at the time, went to his mother's home after a night of drinking on June 22, 2018.

Court was told there was blood everywhere when a cousin came over about 8 a.m. The cousin found Shirley McKay unconscious and badly beaten. Her son has said he doesn't know why he viciously beat her.

The woman was taken to a nursing station before being transported to a hospital in Winnipeg. Her son visited her in hospital daily and was overheard at her bedside sobbing and apologizing.

Court heard he was confronted by a stepbrother and admitted that he had hurt his mother.

Shirley McKay died that September. Her son was arrested the following month.

""She did not recover and died months later, another victim in a mass of slain Aboriginal women,"" Martin said. ""He pled guilty to manslaughter, joining an appalling line of young Aboriginals ending up in prison.""

Crown prosecutors were asking for a seven-year sentence in a federal penitentiary. The defence asked for two years behind bars plus the probation so that McKay could have access to programming available in provincial custody.

The judge pointed to impacts of colonization, the pass system which restricted Indigenous Peoples' movement, residential schools and the '60s Scoop in his sentencing.

""It is well accepted that the government's role, since the early days of dealing with First Nations peoples, has had the effect of isolating, infantilizing, marginalizing, and traumatizing Indigenous societies like the Ojibwa (or Anishinaabe) of Berens River,"" Martin wrote.

""Mr. McKay is a person shaped by a system historically designed to 'take the Indian out of the Indian.'""

Reports provided to the judge on McKay's background said he has partial fetal alcohol syndrome.

One of 13 siblings, he spent most of his time in foster homes on the First Nation or more often in Winnipeg. His parents struggled with alcohol and sniffing substances, and McKay followed a similar path starting when he was 13. His father died in 2010.

McKay was neglected and not cared for, files from child and family services said. He asked to become a permanent ward of child welfare in 2013 because he didn't feel safe with his family.

Martin said McKay's troubled upbringing doesn't excuse his behaviour, but does help explain why he is who he is.

Occasionally it is incumbent on a judge to underscore systemic issues, he said, adding Indigenous people are disproportionately affected by serious crime and disproportionately incarcerated.

""Like so many other cases, this case is troubling, not only for its specific facts, but because it reminds that core issues affecting many in the Indigenous population are not really being addressed sufficiently or urgently enough,"" Martin wrote.

""Many in this and the next generation of Indigenous people are at risk.""

32,burnabynow,https://www.burnabynow.com/experts-say-twitter-breach-troubling-undermines-trust-1.24171586,"Experts say Twitter breach troubling, undermines trust",['Zen Soo'],,"HONG KONG — A breach in Twitter’s security that allowed hackers to break into the accounts of leaders and technology moguls is one of the worst attacks in recent years and may shake trust in a platform politicians and CEOs use to communicate with the public, experts said Thursday.

The FBI is investigating the hack, according to a person familiar with the probe who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing probe and spoke on the condition of anonymity Thursday.

article continues below

The ruse discovered Wednesday included bogus tweets from Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Celebrities Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, were also hacked.

Hackers used social engineering to target some of Twitter’s employees and then gained access to the high-profile accounts. The attackers sent out tweets from the accounts of the public figures, offering to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address.

Cybersecurity experts say such a breach could have dire consequences since the attackers were tweeting from verified, globally influential accounts with millions of followers.

""If you receive a tweet from a verified account, belonging to a well-known and therefore trusted person, you can no longer assume it’s really from them,"" said Michael Gazeley, managing director of cybersecurity firm Network Box.

Reacting to the breach, Twitter swiftly deleted the tweets and locked down the accounts to investigate. In the process it prevented verified users from sending out tweets for several hours.

The company said Thursday it has taken ""significant steps to limit access to internal systems and tools.""

Many celebrities, politicians and business leaders often use Twitter as a public platform to make statements. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, regularly uses Twitter to post about national and geopolitical matters, and his account is closely followed by media, analysts and governments around the world.

Twitter faces an uphill battle in regaining people’s confidence, Gazeley said. For a start, it needs to figure out exactly the accounts were hacked and show the vulnerabilities have been fixed, he said.

""If key employees at Twitter were tricked, that’s actually a serious cybersecurity problem in itself,"" he said. ""How can one of the world’s most used social media platforms have such weak security, from a human perspective?""

Rachel Tobac, CEO of Socialproof Security, said that the breach appeared to be largely financially motivated. But such an attack could cause more serious consequences.

""Can you imagine if they had taken over a world leader’s account, and tweeted out a threat of violence to another country’s leader?"" asked Tobac, a social engineering hacker who specializes in providing training for companies to protect themselves from such breaches.

Social engineering attacks typically target human weaknesses to exploit networks and online platforms. Companies can guard themselves against such attacks by beefing up multi-factor authentication -– where users have to present multiple pieces of evidence as authentication before being allowed to log into a system, Tobac said.

Such a process could include having a physical token that an employee must have with them, on top of a password, before they can log into a corporate or other private system. Other methods include installing technical tools to monitor for suspicious insider activities and reducing the number of people who have access to an administrative panel, Tobac said.

Several U.S. lawmakers called on Twitter to co-operate with authorities including the Department of Justice and the FBI to secure the site.

""I am concerned that this event may represent not merely a co-ordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.

He added that millions of users relied on Twitter not just to send tweets but also communicate privately via direct messaging. Twitter hasn't said if hackers were able to access the private messages of their high-profile targets.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told him in a private conversation in 2018 that the company was working on protecting direct messages, known as DMs, with end-to-end encryption.

But that promise never materialized, Wyden said Thursday, leaving everyone's private messages ""vulnerable to employees who abuse their internal access to the company’s systems, and hackers who gain unauthorized access.""

""This is a vulnerability that has lasted for far too long, and one that is not present in other, competing platforms,"" Wyden said in an emailed statement. ""If hackers gained access to users’ DMs, this breach could have a breathtaking impact, for years to come.""

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

article continues below

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

Bangladesh has reopened businesses including its main export-earning garment sector after a monthslong closure.",[]

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

article continues below

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

""My hope is that this series can be a place to explore meaningful topics together and sort through so many of the questions we’re all trying to answer in our own lives,"" Obama said in a statement.

The new podcast is the first title in the ongoing collaboration between Spotify and Higher Ground, a production company founded by Barack and Michelle Obama. Last year, the former president and first lady partnered with Spotify to produce exclusive podcasts for the platform.

In an email to workers Wednesday night, the company said that since January it has had fewer than 10 cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 that were transmitted in the workplace.

article continues below

But the email from Laurie Shelby, Tesla’s vice-president of environmental, safety and health, also confirmed reports that Tesla is looking into more than 130 positive tests among employees, including those who contracted the virus outside of Tesla facilities. She said less than 0.25% of employees worldwide have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which equals just over 137 workers.

Her message came in response to a report by Electrek.co that over 130 Tesla employees or contractors have tested positive, and hundreds more are waiting for test results. The website said it based the report on internal company data.

Shelby wrote that the story referred to data ""that was in the process of being validated"" and included employees worldwide who may have been infected but never entered a Tesla site, or were infected at home while Tesla's operations were shut down earlier in the year. A Tesla spokesman would not comment on the report or the email, which was obtained by The Associated Press.

""Nearly all — more than 99.99% — of these occurrences were not cases of virus transmitted at work,"" Shelby wrote in the email. ""Most of the positive cases resulted from an individual living with or travelling with someone with COVID-19 and have returned to work after recovering from home.""

Shelby wrote that Tesla doesn't have any employees in serious condition anywhere in the world because of COVID-19.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the numbers from the public health department in Alameda County, California, which includes Fremont, the location of Tesla's only U.S. assembly plant. The factory employs about 10,000 workers.

Some workers have refused to return to the plant out of fear of catching the virus. They did so after CEO Elon Musk in May defied Health Department orders not to restart production under shutdown orders due to the virus.

Some Tesla workers and labour activists say the company is threatening to fire employees who haven’t returned, but Tesla officials have said claims about firings are not true. Workers say they've heard about COVID-19 cases at the plant but they don't know numbers. They have called on the company and health department to release the figures.

However, Shelby wrote in the email that an employee survey found the vast majority of workers feel comfortable with the safety measures being taken by the company.

Among the measures are increased cleaning, limiting access to facilities, temperature checks for employees before they enter buildings, staggered shifts to keep workers apart, additional barriers between employees and providing protective equipment, Shelby wrote.

She urged workers to wear masks or face coverings to stay healthy and save lives and warned that failing to wear masks where required, or not wearing them properly, will bring disciplinary actions. She also wrote that workers should stay home if they're sick.

Musk reopened the Fremont plant May 11 in defiance of county orders. The health department had deemed the factory a nonessential business that can’t fully open under virus restrictions, but Tesla contended it was essential under federal guidelines.

The next day, however, the Health Department announced that the plant could return to manufacturing as long as it delivers on worker safety precautions that it agreed to.",[]

Asa Hutchinson issued an order Thursday requiring people to wear face masks in public throughout the state, which has had a surge in coronavirus cases over the past several weeks.

The Republican governor had resisted a statewide mask mandate and opposed issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the pandemic, but he signed the order requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible in the hopes of slowing the disease's rapid spread in the state. The order takes effect Monday.

article continues below

Hutchinson’s decision comes amid growing support for mask requirements from business and health leaders and a day after Bentonville-based Walmart said it would require customers to wear masks in all of its U.S. stores. The state’s largest newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, also called for a statewide requirement on Thursday.

Hutchinson previously encouraged people to wear masks and allowed cities to pass ordinances requiring their use, but he stopped short of requiring them statewide. He’s the latest Republican governor to relent on the mask issue in the face of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Alabama's governor issued a similar mask mandate on Wednesday.

Arkansas' coronavirus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen despite warnings from national health officials about the risks of doing so too soon. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that did not issue a broader stay-at-home order that kept most businesses closed.

Hutchinson previously questioned how a mask mandate could be enforced in a rural state such as Arkansas, but this week he left open the possibility of such a requirement. The chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences called for a statewide requirement last weekend.

Hutchinson's order was expected to face criticism from some conservatives in the state. Hours before he issued the order, a Republican legislator urged people to call Hutchinson to oppose any mask directive.

A poll by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business suggested tensions are flaring between workers and employers, with around 27 per cent of 3,389 employers polled indicating some of their laid-off staff have refused to return to work.

article continues below

Of the nearly 870 businesses that provided the reasons their employees gave for refusing to return to work, 62 per cent reported workers ""prefer the Canada Emergency Response Benefit."" Employers could choose more than one explanation for why a worker refused to return, and respondents also selected options such as concern for health (47 per cent), childcare obligations (27 per cent) or lack of hours in return offer (16 per cent).

CFIB president Dan Kelly said it's ""clear"" that CERB ""created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality."" Other sectors where conflicts are arising include child care, dental offices, home health care, amusement parks, gambling and spectator sports, the study suggested.

""CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But Ian Robb, Canadian director of the Unite Here union that represents hospitality workers, disagrees. He said workers are impatient to return to work — for what is usually the lucrative summer season — but employers are the ones failing to adopt measures like frequent cleaning and wage subsidies. The union previously estimated that average wages in cities like Toronto are around $20 per hour for hospitality.

""A number of our members in the U.S. have gone to work and contracted (COVID-19),"" Robb said.

""There's just not enough safety in front of service. Nobody wants to stay home and make two grand when they can make double that by working.""

The survey suggested that the hospitality sector had the biggest share of employers, 45 per cent, who had trouble recalling workers. CFIB defines hospitality as including hotels, restaurants and bars.

The CFIB study suggests that in the hospitality sector, 56 per cent of hard-to-fill positions were ""unskilled, entry-level jobs"" that pay ""at or around minimum wage,"" although across sectors, skilled and semi-skilled jobs were harder to fill.

Employment and human rights lawyer Neena Gupta says she has heard of tradespeople unable to perform jobs because workers failed to return.

She said the reason an employee is refusing the work matters. Lack of childcare, like daycare and camps, can be a job-protected reason for staying home, as can disabilities such as being immunocompromised, says Gupta, a partner in Gowling WLG's Waterloo Region and Toronto offices.

The federal government's website states that workers seeking CERB, which offers $500 per week over a limited period, ""should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so."" The government's COVID-19 guidelines also provide for employees to refuse to do a dangerous job, although the worker must already ""be at work"" to refuse such a task.

However, notes Gupta, general apprehension about the pandemic is likely not enough to merit a job refusal. She said workplaces must comply with health and safety guidelines, and that a ministry inspection must find some sort of violation to justify a job refusal.

Managers should give workers a written ""come back to work"" recall and an indication that it will be treated as job abandonment if the worker doesn't return, says Gupta. After that process is completed, the employer could consider that worker terminated for cause, and hire a replacement.

While reporting misuse of CERB by a former employee might appear to give an employer some moral satisfaction, Gupta says it’s unlikely to help with staffing concerns or worker morale.

""I do ask people to be reasonable. You can’t call someone at noon on a Thursday and expect them in at 7 a.m. on Friday,"" she says.

The arts council is hosting two live events this weekend – its first since the COVID-19 pandemic saw the annual Luminescence exhibition cancelled in March.

On Saturday, June 20, from 2 to 4 p.m., visitors can enjoy a Live at the Gallery performance in the gallery’s backyard, and from 3 to 5 p.m., there’s an outdoor painting event.

“With concerts and gigs cancelled, performance halls closed, musicians will be facing a challenging year,” a gallery event notice says. “So to keep uplifting local artists, we’re bringing our Live at the Gallery series outdoors for the time being. You can still enjoy live music, get some fresh air, and support local artists, all at the same time.”

The gallery suggests people set up a picnic on the Deer Lake Park lawn to listen to the music, or add the gallery to their running and walking route.

Anyone who wants to stay on site and listen is asked to be mindful of others around them and maintain the recommended two-metre distance. The gallery also asks people to wear masks, if possible.

The Live at the Gallery gig will feature two singer-songwriters: Carmina Bolinao and Zayda. Bolinao is a Vancouver-based singer who’s heavily inspired by old-school R&B, with a touch of jazz. Zayda is a modern folk-pop singer-songwriter, who offers up both original music and covers combining elements of her favourite genres.

For full details of the performances, check out the Live at the Gallery: Outdoor edition event listing on Facebook.

The outdoor painting session will be led by Burnaby Arts Council board member Farhad Sadhegi Amini. The gallery will be spacing out easels to ensure people are a minimum of six feet apart, and the session will be limited to 10 people.

If more people sign up, the gallery will start a wait list; if there’s significant interest, the arts council says it will consider hosting another session.

Bring your preferred art supplies, and the gallery will also provide painting materials.

For nearly 40 years, the Burnaby Art Gallery and the Burnaby school district have been teaming up on an annual exhibition of student artwork, called Arts Alive.

article continues below

This year, with the gallery unable to host an exhibition in person, the two groups worked together to take it online instead. Art teachers at all eight of the district’s high schools worked with the gallery to create this year’s virtual exhibition.

Thanks to those efforts, Arts Alive 2020 is now online at the Burnaby Art Gallery website, featuring 50 pieces of art from students in grades 8 through 12.

“We’re so proud of these talented students,” said school board chair Gary Wong in a press release. “The entire board is grateful to the gallery and district staff for their creative thinking to find a way to maintain our annual tradition during these unusual times and to publicly celebrate these incredible works of student art.”

Christina Froschauer, fine arts programmer for the gallery, said teachers, students, volunteers and administrators put a great deal of time and effort into the exhibition every year.

“We are elated that the exhibition could be featured online for everyone to enjoy, alongside an Arts Alive art activity – a new way for teachers and students to engage with the artwork,” she said.

That activity guide, which is available online, leads students through the elements of composition and asks them to consider those elements in relation to any piece of art in the exhibition. Then it asks them to create their own mixed-media work in response to the chosen artwork and share it on social media.

“Burnaby students are brimming with artistic talent; we are fortunate to feature student artwork for the past 38 years,” Froschauer said.

Christopher Auchter’s documentary Now Is The Time will go live on the National Film Board’s website on June 21.

The 16-minute NFB documentary revisits a momentous occasion from 1969, when the Haida village of Masset, on Haida Gwaii, raised its first totem pole in more than a century.

In recognition of the 50th anniversary of the pole’s raising, Auchter’s film features an interview with renowned Haida carver Robert Davidson, who was just 22 years old when he carved the pole. The film uses first-hand accounts from Davidson and his younger brother, Reg (whom Davidson paid to help with the carving), as well as Haida scholar Barbara Wilson. Courtesy of a deep dive into both the National Film Board archives and the B.C. Archives, it also incorporates the voices of Haida elders.

Filmmaker Christopher Auchter of Burnaby. - Tracy Auchter, contributed

Auchter, in researching the film, came to see that totem pole raising as a turning point for Haida culture. Before then, traditional culture - including language, dance, dress and ceremonial traditions – had been all but eradicated.

After that momentous day, it began to blossom again.

“It seemed like it was pointing to this pole-raising being a pivotal moment of it all,” Auchter said in a previous interview with the NOW. “It was the deliberate act that made it something people could turn to.”

Now Is The Time has been a success on the film festival circuit, becoming an official selection at numerous international festivals, including Toronto, Vancouver, New Zealand’s Maoriland Film Festival and the prestigious Sundance Film Festival in Utah.

Starting June 21, audiences around the world will be able to access it for streaming, free of charge, at www.nfb.ca.

Metro Vancouver has extended the usual process for its regional cultural grants, in recognition of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the arts community.

Arts and culture organizations now have until Tuesday, Aug. 4 to apply for 2020 grants, rather than the usual spring timeline.

A Metro Vancouver press release notes that a total of $140,000 in funding is available to arts and culture organizations for regional projects, with a maximum of $10,000 per project grant. These annual regional cultural grants support arts and culture projects including research, creation, production, dissemination, audience development, project staff and administrative capacity building.

The release notes this year’s application deadline was extended to give applicants more time to focus on their base operations, brainstorm adapted methods of project delivery and “reconfirm the availability of necessary resources.”

“The arts community is facing unprecedented challenges due to the ongoing public health measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Sav Dhaliwal, chair of the Metro Vancouver board of directors, in a press release.

“As such, we have adjusted this year’s cultural grants program to offer greater clarity and flexibility in terms of project delivery options, timeframes and other grant criteria.

“Arts and culture connect our communities in important and creative ways that are the heart and soul of the quality of life that we all value so much, and we are proud to support the arts and culture community during this difficult period.”

Completed applications must be submitted by 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 4.

A cracked bone? Good to go. What about a sore shoulder? No problem.

article continues below

It's well-known NHLers battle through aches, pains and even illness. Almost like clockwork, a flu bug tears through more than a few locker rooms every season. Players often attempt to soldier on without missing any time, especially when the games matter most.

In the era of COVID-19, however, some of that old the definition of ""toughness"" is being thrown out the window.

Players and coaches are keenly aware that if they're feeling even the slightest bit off — and there are a laundry list of symptoms associated with the novel coronavirus, from chills to headaches to fatigue and weakness — it needs to be reported immediately.

""Doesn't matter if you're a tough hockey player or not,"" said Tippett, now the head coach of the Edmonton Oilers. ""I had a lot of games where I hid a broken finger or something like that from doctors. I didn't want them to know because they wouldn't let me play.

""But when you get sick, you're going to have to tell people. That's just the way of the new world.""

The NHL opened training camps this week as part of its plan to kickstart a campaign that was suspended in mid-March by the pandemic. Players and staff are getting tested every 48 hours — they're not currently quarantined — and that will be kick up another notch to once a day when the 24 teams involved in the resumption head to the hub cities of Edmonton and Toronto, where they'll be kept in a bubble separate from the general public.

Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said the mentality of the past has been turned on its head when it comes to illness.

""As hockey players you want to be in every single game, you want to play, and you want to help your teammate, and you want to be a difference-maker,"" he said. ""Before you played through colds, you played through injuries, you played through sickness and stuff like that.

""You have to step back and think a little bit now. It's a different animal, this virus. You have to be not only cautious of yourself and how you're feeling, but the people around you, too. It's not just your teammates, it's the medical staff, it's the trainers, it's everybody you're around every single day, and even obviously opposing teams. You've got to think of everybody. You've got to be very cautious.""

Edmonton Oilers centre and NHL leading scorer Leon Draisaitl said that caution is going to become the new norm.

""Every hockey player has played through certain things and we've all played through a flu or sickness or whatever it is,"" he said. ""But now with this going around, it makes it a little more dangerous.

""You have to be careful.""

Winnipeg Jets centre Andrew Copp said hockey's team-first mentality should kick in if someone isn't feeling right.

""You hope that everyone's pretty dialled in, and not only for everyone's health and safety, but for the team too,"" he said. ""If this guy gets it, he's not playing. Hopefully everyone can realize that we're all making a lot of sacrifices here.""

The NHL hasn't said how many positive tests would constitute the ""uncontrolled outbreak"" listed in its return-to-play protocol that could conceivably shut the league's resumption down. There's a difference between cases being spread out and a cluster of infections on a team or teams.

The league said earlier this week 30 players tested positive for COVID-19 during voluntary workouts at team facilities between June 8 and July 12. Another 13 positive results came outside of the league's protocol, while 10 other players tested positive in the spring. Training camps opened Monday, but individuals and teams won't be named moving forward with regards to positive tests.

It's no secret players have hid countless injuries in the past, and the league has been criticized heavily for how it dealt with the concussion issue, but Mathieu Schneider, special assistant to NHLPA executive director Don Fehr, said the virus is different territory.

""If concussions were contagious, I think players would feel differently about it,"" Schneider said. ""Guys certainly understand the notion that if they are not honest with symptoms or how they might feel, that they put their entire team in jeopardy.

""There's going to be a huge onus on the players here in (training camp) to make sure that they're taking care of themselves and looking out for their teammates — going to the rink, going home, going to the grocery store, social distancing, wearing mask, washing your hands. All the things that all of us are practising every single day now.""

Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly said it simply comes down to common sense is in this new reality.

""It's on the players and our staff to be honest with each other,"" he said. ""You don't want to put anyone else at risk.

""You want to do what's best for them.""

Matthews finished third in the NHL with a career-high 47 goals, one behind Maurice (Rocket) Richard Trophy co-winners Alex Ovechkin and David Pastrnak, while also topping the Maple Leafs with a career-best 80 points in 70 games.

The 22-year-old Scottsdale, Ariz., native also established a career-low with eight penalty minutes, tied for the fewest among the NHL's top 100 scorers. He did so while sharing second place in the League in takeaways (78) and ranking eighth among NHL forwards in total time on ice (1,467 minutes 52 seconds).

MacKinnon ranked fifth in the NHL with 93 points (35 goals, 58 assists) in 69 games to lead the Avalanche into the playoffs for the third consecutive season.

Ryan entered the NHL/NHLPA Players' Assistance program on Nov. 20 to get help for alcohol addiction. After going public with his story in an effort to help others with addiction issues, an emotional Ryan returned to the ice Feb. 27 and scored three times in a 5-2 win over visiting Vancouver.

Lindblom was diagnosed in December with Ewing's sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that grows in the bones or in the tissue around bones. He completed radiation treatments on July 2.

The 18-year veteran quarterback headlines the Canadian Football Hall of Fame's 2020 class that was unveiled Thursday. Burris, 45, got the nod in his first year of eligibility, becoming just the 21st player ever to do so but second in as many years after Calgary running back Jon Cornish in 2019.

article continues below

Joining Burris in the player category are offensive linemen Clyde Brock and Freddie Childress and quarterback Greg Vavra. John Hufnagel, the Calgary Stampeders president/GM, and Larry Uteck (posthumously), the former head coach/athletic director at Saint Mary’s University, were both named as builders.

Burris's family — wife Nicole and sons Armand and Barron — had known of his induction since February but managed to keep quiet about it until about two and a half weeks ago when the Hall of Fame informed Burris. Even then, the Burris clan was very nonchalant in asking the former quarterback to take in what he thought was a run-of-the-mill video.

Instead, Burris watched Hall of Famer Damon Allen (2012) outline his pro football journey to Canada, which drew a rather bewildered look from Burris. Then Allen detailed Burris's stellar CFL career before Mark DeNobile, the Hall of Fame's executive director, delivered the big news.

And the player, affectionately dubbed Smilin' Hank because of his outgoing personality, was lost for words as tears streamed down his face.

""Yeah, they got me good,"" Burris said with a chuckle. ""What's funny is whenever I've told the boys to keep anything quiet, they've always gone back to their mother and yet they didn't say a peep about this.

""I was lost for words just because to hear it shows you that people appreciated the things you did throughout your career. This is the way for the league and all the organizations and the fans saying, 'Thank you,' and for me I'm humbled by it . . . there's so many guys in there (Hall of Fame) who I looked up to and now to be able to join them is a dream come true.""

The six-foot-one, 190-pound Burris, a native of Spiro, Okla., played 20 pro seasons, 18 in the CFL with the Calgary Stampeders (1997-99, 2005-11), Saskatchewan Roughriders (2000, 2003-04), Hamilton Tiger-Cats (2012-13) and Ottawa Redblacks (2014-16). Burris also spent time with the NFL's Green Bay Packers (2001) and Chicago Bears (2002).

Burris appeared in five Grey Cups, winning three (1998, '08, '16) and being named the MVP twice (2008, '16). The CFL's outstanding player on two occasions (2010, 2015), Burris amassed 63,639 passing yards and 373 TD passes — both third all-time.

Burris retired shortly after leading Ottawa to a thrilling 39-33 overtime Grey Cup upset win over Calgary. He threw for 461 yards and three TDs despite suffering a knee injury during warmups.

Burris said his Hall of Fame induction is as much a testament to his family's resilience and perseverance as it is his on-field accomplishments.

""I had to take my wife all over Canada, drag my kids all over Canada and force them to make new friends just for dad to be able to play this game called football,"" said Burris, whose family still calls Ottawa home. ""And for them to understand and see just the emotions that ran through me . . . it just shows how big that moment is, just kind of when your whole life flashes before you.""

Burris and the other inductees will have to wait for their day in the sun due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 class will be honoured alongside the 2021 inductees next August.

When Burris is formally honoured, he'll be joined by former teammate Childress and Hufnagel, who served as Calgary's head coach (2008-2015) before moving into the front office full-time. Burris won Grey Cups with both ('98 with Childress, '08 with Hufnagel).

""Calgary is a machine right now and it all started in 2008 when Huf came in and we got that Grey Cup in his first year,"" Burris said. ""Calgary has always had double-digit wins and been in the playoffs each and every year Huf has been there, they've always been a strong contender for the Grey Cup and there's one reason why.""

Hufnagel, a 68-year-old native of Coraopolis, Pa., spent 12 seasons as a CFL quarterback with Calgary (1976-79), Saskatchewan (1980-83, 1987) and Winnipeg (1984-86) before getting into coaching. A five-time Grey Cup champion, Hufnagel also earned a Super Bowl ring as an assistant with the New England Patriots (2003).

Hufnagel amassed a 102-42-1 record as Calgary's head coach, his .712 win percentage being the highest among coaches with more than 100 games. He's been named the CFL's coach of the year twice (2008, 2014).

Childress, a 53-year-old native of Little Rock, Ark., played 13 CFL seasons with Shreveport (1994), Birmingham (1995), Calgary (1996-03) and Saskatchewan (2004-06). A former second-round pick of the NFL's New England Patriots, Childress won two Grey Cups with the Stampeders (1998, 2001) and in 1998 was named the CFL's top offensive lineman.

Brock, 79, of Los Angeles, played 12 seasons with Saskatchewan (1964-75), helping the club win its first Grey Cup in 1966. The former Dallas Cowboy-San Francisco 49er appeared in 169 regular-season CFL games and four times was named a league all-star before being inducted into Saskatchewan's Plaza of Honour in 1995.

Vavra, 59, of Red Deer, Alta., helped the Calgary Dinos win the Vanier Cup in 1983, his final season at the school. That year, he also became the first player in the program's history to capture the Hec Crighton Trophy as Canadian university football's top player and still holds the U Sports record for most passing yards in a game (627).

Vavra was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in 1984 and also spent time with the B.C. Lions (1986-87) and Edmonton Eskimos (1988).

After playing seven CFL seasons as a defensive back with Toronto (1974-76), B.C. (1977), Montreal (1978-80) and Ottawa (1980), Uteck became an assistant coach at Saint Mary’s University in 1982. He was promoted to head coach the following year, a position he held until 1997.

Over that span, Uteck was named the Atlantic University Athletic Association coach of the year five times and twice Canadian university football's top coach.

Uteck served as athletic director from 1995 to 2002 and the Huskies captured two Vanier Cups (2001-02). The native of Thornhill, Ont., passed away Dec. 25, 2002 of Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 50.

The Atlantic Bowl was renamed the Uteck Bowl in 2003.

The metaphor suggested by the title of Christian Sands’ new album is apt.

article continues below

The jazz pianist says he was trying to be freer and more flexible on ""Be Water,"" and it shows. The set's 10 cuts explore a wide range of moods and instrumental combinations, with Sands' trio at the core.

Much of the material is built on the same pattern of tension and release found in a body of water. That begins with the opening ""Intro,"" which settles on the tonic chord after nearly four minutes of shimmering undulation.

The reflective ""Still,"" featuring Marvin Sewell on acoustic guitar, rides a mere ripple of rhythm. On ""Be Water II,"" a string quartet plays against the lapping beat established by Sands' piano. Marcus Strickland's woodwind work makes ""Drive"" swing as it crests with a cascading electric guitar solo by Sewell.

Sands rarely cuts loose at the piano — his objective isn't to be splashy — but he takes an active role as the producer, overdubbing extra keyboards and including sound effects and brief recitations by martial artist Bruce Lee. ""Water can flow, or it can crash,"" Lee says. Forgive the flood of puns, but ""Be Water"" flows freely.",[]

Everything about this album is intimidating, including the growling, nether-worldly voice of singer Udo Dirkschneider, and the fact that his backing band is the official concert band of the German military. This album is not for the faint of heart.

The former Accept frontman's solo band U.D.O. teams with the Musikkorps der Bundeswehr to put some real metal in heavy metal on ""We Are One.""

The pairing has undeniable power and force on 15 tracks that deal with environmental threats to the planet (""Future Is the Reason Why"", ""Mother Earth""), the refugee crisis (""Children of the World""), and a reunited Germany (""Rebel Town""), among other topics. The band lends a sweeping grandeur to most of the tracks with horns and strings punching up already-rowdy guitar riffs.

And for those who still miss the diminutive singer's 1980s heyday with Accept, U.D.O. throws them a bone in ""We Strike Back,"" a close cousin of the classic Accept concert opener ""Fast as a Shark,"" with very similar speed, style and structure, right down to the harmonic twin guitar solos.

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro's column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday's newspaper.

article continues below

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, ""has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.""

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check story by Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro's claims.

It wasn't clear how Navarro's column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he's letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last month that an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn't been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor.

Navarro did not immediately return a message for comment.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro's opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci ""a national treasure.""

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint ""shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.""

It wasn't clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he's publicly been more pessimistic than the president. He does webcasts but rarely gives television interviews anymore.

Trump distanced himself from Navarro's column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro's views and ""he shouldn't be doing that.""

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that ""might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives."" USA Today said there isn't enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

The Burnaby resident will cap it the same way, as only the third female to be inducted as an individual player in the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in New Westminster.

article continues below

Bowyer is already n there as a member of the 1982-’93 B.C. Selects.

Bowyer, who recently retired from her career as a probation officer based out of the Justice Institute in New West, was a charter member of the first girls’ box lacrosse team in Port Coquitlam in 1972, when she was 15 years old.

Having already played ice hockey, basketball and baseball, it wasn’t until Bowyer picked up a lacrosse stick that she felt an immediate, almost primal, connection to a sport.

“It was in my soul,” she said. “You felt a bit like a gladiator when you played.”

Bowyer said she loved the camaraderie that quickly developed with her teammates as they learned a new sport together and forged rivalries with teams in Coquitlam, Burnaby, North Vancouver and White Rock.

“We were good athletes, but we weren’t lacrosse players,” she said. “If you practised hard, you felt like you could be anything you wanted to be.”

But it was a sideways compliment after a game that she “played like a boy” that most affirmed her affection for lacrosse.

“It brought me out of my shell,” she said. “It was so invigorating.”

Seeking to elevate her play, Bowyer migrated to the Kirby’s Klipettes out of Burnaby that was coached by former pro, and future Hall of Famer, Dave Evans. The team won league, provincial and national championships.

“There was no going back after that,” Bowyer said.

But there was going outside.

In 1980, Bowyer discovered field lacrosse.

At first, the shallow basket on the stick and lack of body contact felt foreign to her, but she said she loved the ability to run up and down the expansive field in the open air from her position as a midfielder.

With the newly-formed B.C. Selects, Bowyer travelled across Canada and down to the United States to play in tournaments. She captained the team to 11 straight Canadian championships from 1982 to ’93. In fact, the team was so good, in 2014, it was the first female squad inducted into the Hall of Fame.

Bowyer also represented Canada at three world championships, in England in 1982, Philadelphia in “86 and Perth, Australia, in ’89.

A fractured vertebrae suffered in a ball hockey game ended Bowyer’s playing career after that, but she quickly transitioned into coaching at the provincial and national level.

Bowyer said she hopes her induction into the Hall of Fame will serve as a touchstone for other young women in the sport to show them what they can achieve, something she never had.

And while part of her regrets not being a decade or two younger so she could have enjoyed the scholarship opportunities that started emerging through the 1980s to play and get an education at big time American universities, she takes pride in having laid the groundwork for the young women who’ve followed in her wake.

It wasn’t easy, Bowyer said, as funding at the time was non-existent and every trip to a tournament or championship had to be earned not only on the floor or field but with countless hours washing cars or selling t-shirts.

“It makes you feel good that we worked as hard as we did,” she said. “I wouldn’t change a thing.”

A month after the BC Junior A Lacrosse League was supposed to begin playing, the league officially cancelled its 2020 season.

The Minto Cup, along with all other minor and senior national championships, has also been cancelled by the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

In a release, BCJALL president Karl Christiansen said ongoing restrictions in British Columbia limiting the size of public gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic to no more than 50 people made it impossible for games to be played.

“We had hope we might be able to compete this year,” he said. “But it became evident we wouldn’t be able to have a normal season.”

Christiansen said alternative schedules were considered, but public health directives were insurmountable.

CLA president Shawn Williams said health and safety, travel concerns and venue closures were the main considerations in its decision to cancel all 2020 national championships from the Mann Cup senior men’s title to the U12 finals, as well as the U19 women’s field lacrosse championships.

“We recognize that national championships are important to lacrosse players of all ages,” he said, adding all hosts for 2020 events will be charged with staging their championships in 2021. That means the Minto and Mann Cups will both be played in Ontario.

“During this closure, we have been doing as many repairs and maintenance at the club as possible so to avoid closures when we do open,” reads a letter sent to members.

But Paul Dal Monte said the league’s executive and governors are doing everything they can to ensure that doesn’t happen, even as the uncertainty about when restrictions on public gatherings could be lifted continues.

article continues below

At the very least, the coming season - which has already been postponed from its scheduled May 21 start - is unlikely to look like any other normal campaign.

Dal Monte said the league has a contingency to play a schedule as short as 12 games. But any decision on how to proceed relies on continuing direction from health authorities, as well as the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

Dal Monte added he’s also in regular communication with his counterpart at Major Series Lacrosse in Ontario, which is supposed to be hosting the Mann Cup national championship in September.

“We stay on top of things,” Dal Monte said. “We understand the pain points and challenges.”

One of those pain points is the financial viability of the league and its seven teams, including the Coquitlam Adanacs, Burnaby Lakers and New Westminster Salmonbellies.

Dal Monte said the niche nature of lacrosse means teams rely on sponsors and partnerships rather than gate receipts to cover expenses, and with so many businesses suffering because of the pandemic, those dollars may be hard to come by this summer.

“At this stage, it creates a significant obstacle for us and many of our teams,” he said, adding without the certainty of a schedule, it’s difficult for teams to even begin having a conversation with potential sponsors.

Dal Monte conceded some teams might have a hard time operating.

Still, he said, time is on the league’s side. Virtual meetings with team governors are being held May 2 and 16 to assess the current situation and options for moving forward.

Any final call on how to proceed with a season could be held off as late as June 1, Dal Monte said. Then “we would have to make a decision one way or the other.”

Meanwhile, the president of the BC Junior A Lacrosse League said a recent pronouncement by British Columbia’s health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, suggesting large gatherings of people may not be allowed through the summer in an effort to quash transmission of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 puts his league’s ability to hold a season “at risk.”

The BCJALL, which includes the Coquitlam Jr. Adanacs, PoCo Saints as well as junior incarnations of the Lakers and Salmonbellies among its eight teams, was supposed to play its first regular season game on Saturday. But that’s now on hold with the league executive meeting next on May 19.

Karl Kristiansen said the league could reduce its schedule to 14 games from 21, or even stage a tournament-style season to determine playoff teams that could compete for a chance to go to the Minto Cup in St. Catharines in August. That is, if the national championship even gets the green light to play.

Kristiansen said his group should have more clarity after the CLA meets May 15 when the fate of several national championships, from youth to senior leagues, is expected to be decided.

On the day Finance Minister Carol James announced a $12.5 billion deficit, the combined effect of an economic meltdown and $6.26 billion in supports to date, a polling company released details of a huge jump in approval ratings for how the B.C. government has stick-handled the pandemic.

Meanwhile, the BC Liberals are weighing in with a hefty criticism of the government’s economic recovery plan, and trying to get their voices heard above the fray.

In a press release issued today Wednesday, Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson stated that under the BC NDP-government’s watch, the province has amassed the largest deficit in British Columbia’s modern history.

He contends that this year’s deficit has increased by 27.6%, or $2,643 for every British Columbian, while household incomes are estimated to fall by approximately 3.9% in 2020.

James, however, maintains that B.C.’s safe restart plan is “creating signs of hope for our economy as consumer confidence increases.”

Wilkinsons argues the economic recovery plan is lacking because “there will be no change in the government spending priorities” and the strategy is “simply unsustainable.”

Source: Insights West Graphic

Still, the Insights West poll suggests the government has got a lot of wriggle room in its appeal to British Columbians, noting that the BC NDP has approved its rating during the pandemic, with Premier Horgan himself ratcheting up his approval rating by 17% to 68%, “a higher level higher than for any political leader in B.C. since tracking began 8 years ago.”

Meanwhile, Insights West said its online poll — which ran from June 24-28 among 830 B.C. residents — shows opposition parties are having a difficult time catching the attention of B.C. voters.

The poll found Wilkinson’s approval rating has dropped five points since November to 30%. Interim Green leader Adam Olsen has made his debut at a 29% approval rating — the lowest of any Green leader since the 2017 election, and 44% of B.C. residents don’t know enough about him to provide a rating. Trevor Bolin from the BC Conservative Party, meanwhile, has an 18% approval rating, but similarly, 49% of British Columbians didn’t know enough about him to provide a rating.

Insights Wests notes that approval of the government’s response to the pandemic has improved its ratings overall.

For example, 85% think it has done a good job on combating COVID-19, 84% for providing info about the pandemic, 79% for phase 2 and phase 3 re-opening of the economy, and 69% for the financial support for people impacted from COVID-19.

However, a closer reading shows a dip in areas where B.C. residents are “typically more negative than positive towards the BC NDP’s handling of certain issues, such as housing and affordability, down nine points, and homelessness down 13%.",[]

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

The two developments, both from Blue Sky Properties, are connected by a tower of rentals set to be built on Kathleen Avenue in Metrotown. The main rezoning application, focusing on the 5900-block of Kathleen Avenue, involves a proposed 34-storey building that would include 230 market rentals and 94 non-market units.

article continues below

Of those 94 non-market units, 66 are related to a proposed development at 5977 Wilson Ave., where Blue Sky is looking to build a 42-storey, 356-unit market condo development. The Wilson Avenue development had gone through the public hearing process, but shortly before it was set for final approval, it was sent back to the drawing board as the city developed its new rental zoning policy.

That policy requires developers to replace any existing rentals torn down for new developments or make 20% of the new units non-market rentals, whichever is higher. Occupants of torn-down rentals must also be offered a unit in the new development at the same rent plus provincially allowed annual increases.

The Wilson Avenue development saw 14 letters weighing in, along with seven speakers, some of whom were also among the letter-writers.

Among those in opposition, Earl Thomas Pollitt wrote that the construction would adversely affect his voice-over business on the same street. Staff responded to Pollitt by noting the construction would need to comply with the noise abatement bylaw, according to the minutes from the June 23 public hearing.

Hannah Weibe expressed concerns around declining property values in the area resulting from the developments, as well as the effects of density on light and noise pollution and strains on public transit and other infrastructure.

The Kathleen Avenue site, however, currently holds single-family houses and undeveloped land, and the proposal to replace those with a tower didn’t sit well with everyone. Six letters and a petition containing 99 signatures were sent to council on that project.

The letters regarding the Kathleen Avenue site largely reflect the same arguments around the Wilson Avenue site, including potential traffic and other infrastructure strain and noise from construction. One letter-writer, Reinhard Schauer, pointed to the city’s Metrotown plan, which calls for Central Park East to include more gentle density to “respect the neighbourhood’s park-side nature.”

Coun. Colleen Jordan, too, spoke out against the development in the July 6 council meeting, during which council gave the rezonings second reading.

She noted the city owns several properties along Kathleen Avenue and had intended on buying more in the past to consolidate the properties and “do something special” with the street.

“It’s been talked about in many discussions about consolidating with other properties across the street and across the back,” Jordan said, “but nothing has ever come forward in a substantive way to develop the whole block.”

She quoted the petition that was delivered to council, which said the development is “not only bad for our street, it’s bad for Metrotown, it’s bad for the people who, in the future, will live in this cramped ghetto.”

Letter-writers pointed to the sharp density of the development, which packs 34 storeys onto a relatively small lot, an argument Jordan amplified in council.

“It’s an easy way out for the developer to take a huge amount of density, transfer it from his Wilson Avenue site to this one,” she said. “This site will have a total floor-area ratio of 11.67. It will be almost twice what is the usual floor area in the Metrotown plan. … I think it’s setting a horrible precedent.”

The petition also notes the development of Kathleen Avenue should take a “holistic” approach that would incorporate the entire block, rather than piecemeal work through individual rezonings.

The developments passed second reading at the July 6 council meeting, with only Jordan and Coun. Dan Johnston opposed, and still require third reading and final approval.

I ride in the SkyTrain and cannot have a cell conversation, or listen consistently to anything.

article continues below

It is incredibly loud - worse for riders right by the noise. If someone needs to talk to me via phone call, I have to exit and go outside on the street to return a call.

That also is difficult further from the trains. It's common to communicate while commuting. Yes, texts can be done due to excessive noise, but this noise is grating on the ears and people tend to talk even louder on the train to compensate.

Noise pollution is added stress while going to work. Nerves are affected in hearing areas of the brain, which does not assist anyone in staying calm or relaxed during the ride. Added to this tension, there are Covid rules being disregarded in all kinds of ways.

People have to tell others to move away. Thousands of repetitions of keep social distance and it still has not become understood that means you need to show patience, notice if you are too close. It's not helpful that the trains only stop for the usual amount of time.

That causes crowding at doors going in or out of trains. It is all kinds of added stressors. Not a lot of changes have been put in place to make more time for doing spacing properly.

Train attendants stand around saying nothing. Could it be everyone has got minor hearing loss? There seems to be less thinking about the system and its operation. Not noticing louder noise, or how people don’t follow simple logic of spacing their bodies apart, I wonder why awareness has taken a back seat. Translink states it offers quality of service via its transportation service.

At stations, new signage and barriers are erected to direct rules and the flow of lines. Maintenance crews attend to lights and escalators, cleaning at the stations. These are necessary actions. But between stations, the experience is not as much quality.

Isn’t that part, part of the overall quality?

Attendants rarely ride on the trains. I am not sure what they are really getting paid for. They are paid for responding to deviance or worse issues of less cooperative riders. What about the majority that rides and acts properly, causing no concerns? We do want some positive response to noted issues. Action by Translink needs to be reflective of their quality mandates, not they tried to fix the tracks.

What about upper administration riding trains for 1 week? They would understand what riders have been saying to their departments for months. Does Translink care about its services or its assets? I do applaud some dedicated train/Translink staff who are responsive to concerns I have had. Myself and others are listening for responses of action to prove that their mission statement is about quality.

Also noted at Metrotown station, there is huge screeching that is constant. I have to cover my ears every time. There are also several construction sites making loud noise beside that station and others. Technologies are all the rage, yet don’t seem be applied to real issues that are causing negative effects. Corporate deafness is not a position Translink can justify.

Surely they enjoy quiet offices and staff are not permitted to have music or conversations above a certain noise level. It's time to be aware of actual feedback from riders, and to recall their own concerns about ridership decreases. Translink has resources to do improvements now. Saving for further developments ought to be suspended in light of harmful effects that are not being addressed.

As retailers and mall owners in Burnaby grapple with the repercussions of the pandemic, many are accelerating their business plans, rapidly experimenting with new business models and expanding innovative thinking to find ways to keep malls relevant in the new normal and into the future.

article continues below

According to The future of the mall: Building a new kind of destination for the post-pandemic world, there are five critical changes that mall landlords, retailers, and the entire industry must embrace to protect the sector and keep Canadians coming back into stores.

“Now more than ever, landlords and retailers need to work hand in hand in an effort to get ahead of the evolving trends andcreate a reason for Canadian consumers to return to in-store shopping post-pandemic and have a smooth, stress-free experience,” said Marty Weintraub, partner and national retail leader at Deloitte Canada. “The mall of the future will be a destination that feeds the functional requirements of our lives as well as our need to be social. It will be a thriving community where people will live, work, play, and eat. It will not be your parents’ mall — so much so that we may no longer call it a “mall” at all.”

According to Weintraub, mall owners and retailers need to invest in these five key changes in order to survive and thrive in the post-pandemic world and get Canadians coming back in store:

Focus on safety and convenience: The new mall will need to carefully balance consumers’ desire for social interaction with their need for a safe, easy shopping experience. Retailers and landlords need to address customers’ concerns by finding innovative ways to adjust how they organize their stores, interact with customers, collect payment, and deliver products. The key to getting people back into malls will be for owners and retailers to work together to invest in customer safety, and to provide tools and applications that make for a smoother, more convenient shopping experience.

Rethink the role of the store: Given mall foot traffic had fallen by 22 percent in the country’s top 10 malls even before the COVID-19 outbreak (2019 vs. 2018), retailers need to reconsider the size and number of stores that will meet their customers’ needs, eliminating poorer-performing stores and focusing on showroom, pop-up locations, and other innovative formats. The growth of online shopping (with 78 percent of consumers expecting online shopping to increase in popularity post-pandemic) calls into question the need for an extensive network of stores. Consumers will no longer come in just to browse; they will arrive already knowing what they want, and the associate’s role will be to facilitate the purchase through an exceptional customer experience.

Make way for the food revolution: As less relevant fashion retailers move out of mall locations, their departure will make room for landlords to bring in an exciting new breed of restaurant offerings. This will feed the consumer’s desire for social experience and will likely become the new anchor bringing visitors to the mall. As a social experience, dining out appeals to all customer segments—and it cannot be replicated online. Smart mall owners are viewing food and beverage venues as the new anchor that will enhance their destination appeal. When it comes to the experience of food choices in the mall, a renaissance is coming.

Embrace technology: Retailers need to take a page from digital-first companies—it’s never been more important to build a seamless and integrated physical and digital brand presence. Customers are increasingly looking for a digitized experience both online and off, enabled by technological innovation at every turn. Malls and retailers need to use digital tools to maximize productivity and efficiency and create a dynamic, engaging experience, such as product testing and simulation using AR and VR technologies, an “endless-aisle” distribution strategy that can deliver in 24 hours or less, pop-up shops to showcase new products both in person and online, as well as online concierge services, digitized browsing, and virtual fitting rooms.

Become a new destination: Most of all, the mall must become the new meeting place for the community—a multi-purpose destination that offers extensive leisure activities as well as other functions, like office, residential, and cultural amenities. Shops should be mixed in with other complementary uses, giving visitors an interactive experience in which the entire environment comes into play. Owners may need to rethink their rental models to allow for different types of retail experiences, such as short-term pop-ups or exhibitions. There is a great opportunity here to be innovative.

The COVID-19 pandemic has served to accelerate changes that were already underway and accelerate innovation among mall owners and retailers alike. Canadian consumers were already starting to change how they shopped, and now they are looking for a significantly better experience that connects the online world to an elevated in-person experience for the long term. The unknowns coming out of the pandemic have added even more variables into this evolution that need to be navigated, such as how long social distancing measures will be maintained as well as the accelerated shift in consumer behaviours.

“One thing is certain: a revolution is coming to our retail experience,” added Weintraub. “It’s clear that the pandemic has changed how people feel about interacting with the world around them. These changes could last long into the future, which meansretailers and landlords alike have both a great opportunity and obligation to reimagine the entire customer journey and createa totally new kind of destination that will keep visitors coming back for years to come.""",[]

Microsoft will not reopen its huge store in Metropolis at Metrotown and Aldo has filed for creditor protection.

The impacts of COVID-19 have been the final nail for some struggling retailers, and restaurants as well. Nando’s in Burnaby has shut down one of its locations.

Aritzia Inc., which operates out of Metropolis at Metrotown, reported a whopping first-quarter loss and revenue drop after temporarily closing all its stores due to COVID-19 health precautions, but the clothing retailer sees an opportunity to expand its business amid the global pandemic.""It wasn't easy seeing all our boutiques closed ... and the corresponding decline in our revenues and our profitability,"" said CEO Brian Hill.

The Vancouver-based retailer closed its 96 stores on March 16 and saw a significant decline in sales in the first two weeks of that month. Despite the drop in overall revenues, e-commerce sales grew more than 150 per cent during the quarter.

Aritzia started a phased reopening of stores on May 7. Thirty had reopened by the end of the quarter and 89 as of July 9, including in Burnaby.

Reopened stores have exceeded the company's expectations so far, said Hill, noting the company is viewing the second quarter ""with cautious optimism as we prepare for a period of recovery.""

During the first five weeks of the quarter, reopened stores have performed at 55 per cent to 65 per cent of last year's revenue levels, he said, calling that ""well above our initial expectations.""

""We don't know what the new normal will hold until sometime next year.""

Aritzia's net revenue for the first five weeks of the second quarter were down 25 per cent to 30 per cent compared with the same time last year, said chief financial officer Todd Ingledew.

E-commerce revenue remains strong, though growth has moderated since most of the company's stores have reopened, he said, and is currently trending 50 per cent to 100 per cent higher than last year.

Aritzia plans to open five or six new stores and reposition three existing locations, primarily in the second half of the fiscal year. Half of the leases the company has signed were negotiated after the pandemic began and reflect what he called ""compelling post-COVID financial terms.""

The real estate opportunity for Aritzia right now is ""unprecedented,"" said Hill, noting that the company is understored and many other retailers are shutting their bricks-and-mortar locations.

""More premier locations are becoming available and under increasingly compelling financial terms,"" he said.

""So much so, it's hard to determine at this point if our stores were more profitable prior to COVID-19 ... or our new stores will be more profitable as a result of new economics post COVID-19.""

The Toronto-based private equity firm that owns Gateway had agreed in December to sell the 27-property gaming operation to New York City’s Leisure Acquisition Corp. for $1.5 billion.

article continues below

The transaction was set to close on April 5, but that closing date was pushed back to June 30.

Last week, Leisure Acquisition’s shareholders voted to again extend the deadline for closing the deal to buy Gateway – this time until December 1.

Gateway’s holdings in Metro Vancouver include the Grand Villa Casino in Burnaby, the Starlight Casino in New Westminster and the Cascades Casino Resort in Langley.

“The company believes that it is unlikely that there will be sufficient time before June 30, 2020 to complete an initial business combination,” Leisure Acquisition said in a June 23 corporate filing.

It then added some doubt about whether the transaction would ever close.

“Either the company or Gateway has the ability to terminate the merger agreement to the extent the business combination has not been completed by July 15, 2020,” Leisure Acquisition said in its filing. “There can be no assurance that it will be possible to complete a business combination with Gateway prior to July 15, 2020.”

With the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging many service-sector businesses’ balance sheets, plenty of mergers and acquisitions in those industries that were agreed to before March have either been scrapped or are uncertain to close.

Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands in February agreed to sell a 55% stake to Sycamore Partners for US$525 million, but then accepted Sycamore’s bid to scuttle the transaction.

Cineworld Group plc (LSE:CINE) similarly terminated its $2.8 billion takeover of Cineplex Inc. (TSX:CGX).

Rumours have swirled that Air Canada (TSX:AC) has been lobbying federal officials to block its plans to buy Air Transat for $700 million, although Canada’s national carrier has denied those reports.

Lawson Lundell partner Mandeep Dhaliwal stressed to Business in Vancouver that he is not aware of the situation between Catalyst and Leisure Acquisition. However, he said, that the global pandemic is likely giving many companies pause to consider transactions that have not yet completed.

“A lot of companies that had agreed to transactions, if they think that things have materially changed and would not be as beneficial, they would be scrutinizing the text of contracts to see if there is anything for material adverse change or force majeure [unforeseeable circumstances that could prevent a company from fulfilling a contract],” Dhaliwal told Business in Vancouver.

“Certainly there’s been a lot of conversations about this in the past few months.”

Dhaliwal, whose practice deals mainly with banks and private lenders in secured and unsecured financing transactions, said that while deal flow is down from 2019 corporate transactions are being completed.

“Now, I was a bit of a pessimist to begin with, thinking that things would fall off a cliff, so it’s all a matter of perspective, but transactions have been closing over the past few months,” he said.

Back in 2010, Dhaliwal’s firm represented Catalyst on some aspects of its acquisition of Gateway.

Gateway had morphed from being an income fund in 2007 to being owned by two shareholders: Crown and Macquarie Bank.

Those entities borrowed more than $1 billion from various banks, and in 2010 had started to run into trouble.

A consortium of debt holders, led by Catalyst, started buying Gateway’s debts from various banks and consolidated that debt.

Catalyst executives then offered an ultimatum to Gateway principals on behalf of all the debt holders. Catalyst wanted Gateway to either pay off its debts or ante-up the lion’s share of the company’s equity.

That set the wheels in motion for the debt-holders to pay off $1 billion of Gateway’s $1 billion-plus in debt and provide a capital infusion of $100 million, and a $500 million term loan.

In exchange, they got 98% of the company and were free to start racking up some new debt of their own.

Dhaliwal told BIV in 2011 that he found it fascinating to watch how private equity investment firms went out to purchase public debt with an eye to becoming management, and acquiring equity, only to then go out and raise new debt for the enterprise.

Once in control of Gateway, the Catalyst consortium hired Jefferies and Co. to raise hundreds of millions of dollars of debt in the bond market.

Catalyst also briefly intended to take Gateway public in 2012 but did not complete the IPO.

Gateway bills itself as one of the largest and most diversified gaming and entertainment companies in Canada, with 25 gaming properties in B.C. and Ontario as well as two additional properties in Edmonton Alberta.

It employs 8,200 people and features 423 table games, 14,076 slot machines, 82 food and beverage outlets and 561 hotel rooms.",[]

The Greater Vancouver Food Bank Society provides food support to more than 8,000 children, seniors, and people with disabilities in Burnaby, New Westminster, Vancouver and the North Shore through 13 community food hubs. In order to unload up to 15,000 pounds of food and to set up its ""pop-up grocery stores"" at neighbourhood houses, churches and community centres, the food bank relies on the generosity of up to 20 volunteers for a four-hour service for each site three weeks every month.

""Our weekly food hubs are not only a place for people to access food but they are places to build community and connect with resources like nurses, dieticians and tax help,"" David Long, Greater Vancouver Food Bank CEO, said in a news release. ""We've hit a critical gap in weekly volunteers for our food hubs and are appealing to the public for support to ensure we are able to deliver this important service to the communities we serve.""

According to the society, hub volunteers create a warm, dignified and welcoming environment where clients can select fresh and non-perishable items for themselves and their families and can connect with resources in their community.

“Making new friends and seeing old ones every week provides a stable, consistent place many rely on for breaking the cycle of social isolation,” said the society’s press release. “We are extremely grateful for these volunteers, but need more to continue offering this critical service.”

The Southside Community Church program (7135 Walker Ave.) operates in Burnaby. Other community food hubs in critical need of volunteers are the New West Community Food Hub (613 Queens Ave.) and the St. Margaret's Cedar Cottage Church location in Vancouver (1530 East 22nd Ave.)

“Each food hub is unique and caters to the diverse needs of their community with invaluable input from site hosts,” said the press release. “If you speak a second language, enjoy working with people or simply want to be a part of a team that cares about their community, this is the role for you.”

The Greater Vancouver Food Bank has a vision of providing accessible, healthy and sustainable food and proactively working to alleviate hunger in the communities it serves.

""Volunteering at the food bank has certainly become one of the highlights of my week,"" said Alex, a volunteer at the Kiwassa Neighbourhood House Community Food Hub.

If you or anyone you know has a few hours to spare each week, or every other week, contact the food bank’s volunteer coordinator at volunteer@foodbank.bc.ca or 604-880-7073.

Gloria Cooper and Aruna N.B. Khan teamed up to host the Everyday Superheroes drive-by food bank event at Cariboo Hill Secondary School on May 30.

“The event went better than we could ever have imagined,” Khan wrote in an email to the NOW.

Cooper, a mortgage specialist, and Khan, a Realtor, have frequently teamed up in the past to host community events.

“Due to lockdown and social distancing, we were forced to think outside the box as to how we could bring community together to help combat some of the effects of COVID-19 in our communities,” their email said. “So, we came up with this big and crazy idea that involved cars driving by like a drive-through restaurant, people popping trunks, food being collected, superheroes, capes, cowbells and prizes. We had no idea if it would work or not.”

The two stayed up several nights into the wee hours creating superhero capes, sourcing prizes, creating logos and making volunteer badges – all on a quest to share their message that, no matter who you are, you can be a superhero and make a positive impact on your community.

The two noted they were determined to help families who are struggling to access food during this pandemic and to bring community together in the process.

It worked.

“Donors drove from as far as Surrey and North Vancouver to come to our drive-by to make a donation,” they said.

Crest Plaza’s Pharmasave employees pitched in bagged goodies (dropped off by local canine actor Action Jackson Brown and his owner), and local resident Victor Villamera came by with crates of fresh bread, bagels and buns – enough to feed hundreds of people – all bought and donated on his own birthday.

Volunteers – including Mayor Mike Hurley, MP Peter Julian and MLA Katrina Chen – donned red capes to help out, and Burnaby firefighters arrived in one of their large trucks, with sirens on, and stayed to cheer on donors.

“With the help, kindness, enthusiasm and generosity of our amazing superheroes – our leaders, volunteers (adults and youth), community members, local businesses and the Burnaby firefighters, we were able to collect superhero volumes of food to distribute to four food banks throughout Burnaby and New Westminster,” their email says.

That realization has led to the creation of an Everyday Superheroes drive-by food donation event, set for Saturday, May 30 at the Cariboo Hill Secondary School parking lot.

Realtor Aruna Khan and mortgage specialist Gloria Cooper are organizing the food drive.

“Presently, from reading posts, communicating with people and watching the news, it is evident that so many of us at home are feeling useless and are craving to help in some sort of way,” Khan wrote in an email to the NOW. “But, understandably, ‘helping’ is quite the challenge during COVID-19 as we cannot gather.”

After speaking with various food banks and community leaders, the two women found out that food bank donations have dropped dramatically since quarantine began – but the need for the food has not.

So the two are inviting everyone to a contactless food drive, running from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the parking lot at Cariboo Hill Secondary School (8580 16th Ave., Burnaby).

How it works is simple: Just pack a bag or box in your trunk with your non-perishable food donations. Enter the school parking lot via 16th Avenue, and volunteers will guide you through the driveway to the drop-off spot. Once there, pop open your trunk from the safety of your driver’s seat. A volunteer, wearing gloves and mask, will take the donations from the trunk and leave a thank-you note for you.

“With the constant stream of sad/bad news and feelings of hopelessness, we believe that an event like this would not only life the spirits of the community but give everyone an opportunity to help support each other and make a difference in a very safe, easy and fun way during these challenging times,” Khan wrote.

Khan said organizers are grateful for the support of community leaders, including mayors Mike Hurley of Burnaby and Jonathan Cote of New Westminster, New Westminster-Burnaby MP Peter Julian and Burnaby-Lougheed MLA Katrina Chen, whom she noted have all expressed a hope to turn out and volunteer.

An online livestream will run from 9 to 10:30 a.m. (Pacific time), and it can be accessed from anywhere with an Internet connection. The livestream will introduce people across Canada who are affected by dementia, and it will pay a call on walkers and Alzheimer’s societies across the country.

A press release about the event notes that more than 70,000 British Columbians live with dementia, and that number is expected to grow.

“Dementia doesn’t stop, and neither do we,” said Alzheimer Society of B.C. CEO Maria Howard. “Even though the ways we are delivering our programs and services have needed to change, we are still committed to helping British Columbians affected by dementia. I invite all of you to help us do this by registering and fundraising for the IG Wealth Management Walk for Alzheimer’s online.”

Everyone who wants to take part is invited to get moving – in whatever way works for them – and share a photo or video online, using the hashtag #IGWalkForAlz. You can do jumping jacks, lift weights, do a dance, stroll around the block, take the stairs, do yoga, or whatever else appeals to you.

You can do your personal fitness challenge before, during or after the event and create a fundraising page to share with friends and family.

“We know that due to physical distancing, many people are feeling isolated,” Howard said. “We hope that by joining us at the online event, Canadians affected by dementia can connect with each other and honour and remember people in their lives affected by the disease. Now, more than ever, connection is important.”

For Keystone Environmental Ltd., a consulting firm that provides expertise on a spectrum of environmental challenges – such as contaminated sites, site assessments, environmental management and compliance programs – those fundamentals have helped the company achieve incredible longevity and continued growth, along with a sterling reputation in the industry.

article continues below

Raminder Grewal, president of Keystone Environmental, notes that the organization first opened its doors in 1988 as a subsidiary of The Koppers Company, with just a single employee. In 1993, Keystone became independent after being acquired by the initial three shareholders and the company refocused its business efforts on the local B.C. marketplace. They now have a team of over 90 staff, and have been headquartered in Burnaby for almost two decades.

“Over the years, our solutions approach to the environmental consulting practice has continued in all disciplines in which we provide services: biological sciences, engineering and contaminated sites,” said Grewal. “On each of our client engagements we seek to meet the needs of our clients while respecting the environmental considerations, developing solutions that achieve the goals of both the client, and the regulatory community.” The company is often up against massive multinational companies, as many competitors in the market were purchased and merged into larger engineering firms over the years.

“Our challenge is to compete against these large firms that have significant marketing budgets, vast technical experience internationally, and the ability to secure large client engagements,” said Grewal. “While we continue to compete with major engineering firms, we have focused on remaining nimble and laser focused on our clients’ objectives with more resources and technical bench strength and are now developing a network of relationships with other environmental engineering firms.”

One of the ways Keystone has garnered its phenomenal reputation is by investing in its people.

“Ultimately, our client’s overall success is obtained by focusing on staff and mentoring them in their career to help them reach their own personal career goals,” he said.

In fact, he notes, fostering staff is part of Keystone’s mission statement, which states: “Focusing on people and performance, we will be the go-to environmental consulting firm.”

Grewal himself has earned plenty of accolades over the years as well: in 2007, he became the youngest partner and department head in the company’s history. Since then, he has grown the company’s revenue year over year, and created new relationships with diverse core clients, including federal contracts with agencies such as Public Works. In 2013, he became president and then majority shareholder in 2017.

The company was named in Canada’s Top 100 Small and Medium Employers this year, a reflection of efforts to ensure Keystone is an employer of choice. And recently, Grewal was named the Burnaby Board of Trade’s 2018 Business Person of the Year in their annual Business Excellence Awards.

It’s a significant recognition of the leadership he’s provided the company but he says the credit ultimately goes to his staff.

“This was only a result of our team,” he said. “I am very fortunate to work with such an amazing team. Our strength is in our people and how we pull together in challenging projects.”

Peter and Marijana Pocrnic work one-on-one with customers to help them choose the best flooring options for their needs from a wide selection of new and traditional products sourced from top-notch suppliers.

“We’re small and that allows us to give people a different level of service. We’re able to give each customer that personal attention, working together with them,” he said. “We also do a lot of custom work, manufacturing our own mouldings, for example, and that makes us stand out.”

Their Burnaby Heights showroom is open on Saturdays from 10 am to 4 pm, or Monday to Friday by appointment between 9 am and 5 pm. They also make house calls, bringing samples along to help customers get a sense of what might work best in their homes, whether it’s for something being built new or a home renovation or upgrade.

“We do it all. People can come in here and take a look around, get some ideas, or we can come to them,” he said. “There’s so many options, and we carry a really wide variety of choices. There’s a lot more available today than there was before.”

Peter got his start in the flooring industry by working in sales for one of Canada’s largest distributors. After spending so much time in flooring stores, and seeing the business from the distributor end, he decided to go out on his own.

“I was going into a lot of businesses and over time I thought this is something I can really see myself doing,” he said. “We started from scratch, and we’re really happy with how we’ve grown.”

Many new customers come to Casa Madera through recommendations from previous customers.

“We love to hear that, it’s a great feeling to know someone suggested us,” he said. “I’m happy if I know that a customer is happy not just with their floors, but with their floors, but with the service they got, the installers who performed the work, everything.” The flooring industry has changed a lot in recent years, and many people are surprised by the spectrum of choices available to them. For example, hardwood flooring comes in a much larger array of colours nowadays, and there’s an ever-growing interest in products like luxury vinyl tile. Peter says it’s a rewarding part of his business to be able to help educate a customer on what’s available and lead them to the best choices for their lifestyle, space, and needs.

The business is part of the Burnaby Heights business district right with a storefront right on Hastings Street.

“We live in Burnaby and this is such a close-knit community in the Heights. But it’s also close to the north shore, and it’s bordering Vancouver. It’s central, so that’s great for our customers.” They are also active members of the Homebuilders Association Vancouver (HAVAN) which allows them to connect to other businesses in the field and to stay abreast of industry changes.

When the pandemic hit, it was about if they should stay open and try and survive on takeout service. Some restaurants were better equipped than others to set up for takeout and deliveries. Pizza joints, for example.

article continues below

Then it was how to reopen on June 1, and if that should include sit-down service.

The Burnaby restaurant with the biggest portions has bucked the trend to reopen sit-down service by sticking with takeout.

That restaurant would be Anton’s Pasta, which advertises its “enormous portions” right on its homepage.

This Burnaby Heights institution on Hastings Street prides itself on serving up tasty portions of pasta that you will likely not finish in one sitting. So Anton’s is used to packaging up food and sending it home with diners.

Good for them.

Burnaby restaurants are finding out what works for them and going for it. I was at Anton’s the other night and business seemed brisk. It could returned at some point to sit-down service and if it does, I’ll let you know.

I wrote about Anton’s last October and it was the most-read food blog I’ve had in more than two years.

This is part of what I wrote about its enduring charm: “One reason? The huge menu. There are a lot of difference choices of pasta dishes on Anton’s menu. Another reason? Huge portions. It’s a calling card. People proudly waddle out of Anton’s with a container of food that will feed the family for dinner the next night, or you for a few more lunches. Life is expensive in Burnaby so it’s nice to get two meals for the price of one. And eating homemade pasta feels comforting.”

Life is still just as expensive and even more people are out of work right now due to the pandemic.

So if you’re struggling but still want to treat yourself, check out Anton’s and get fed for a few days. Sometimes food equals happiness.

Re: 'Screeching' SkyTrain in Burnaby:

article continues below

﻿The increased and excessive noise of SkyTrain is occurring in locations other than New Westminster and may represent a larger and more costly problem than TransLink is conceding.

Residents living near the track west of Edmonds station, where it parallels Rumble Street, have been complaining to SkyTrain since March of intolerable noise levels averaging 90 decibels westbound and now approaching the same eastbound.

While on the street over 60-metres away, conversations must stop until the trains pass. In homes, the same distance or further from the track windows must be closed to hear TV shows even with increased volume.

There are hundreds of residents affected in this section of the line. The adverse health impacts of continued exposure to excessive noise on humans and their pets are well-documented. Hearing damage begins at 85 db with prolonged exposure.

Our exposure at 40 metres is greater than a motorcycle or lawnmower at eight metres, where ear protection is recommended.

TransLink has responded to our letters with the same explanation regarding the broken track grinder and the same assurances maintenance will be done here in July.

However, grinding was done in 2019 to reduce noise levels almost as bad as current, and rails were replaced a number of years ago, yet residents who have lived here for over 20 years believe the current noise levels are well above any they have experienced.

While we are anxious for the maintenance ASAP, as the noise is intolerable with trains running at 90-second intervals to ensure capacity for social distancing, our experience suggests this grinding needs to be done semi-annually to maintain normal operating levels.

As the problem of pitting in the rails was reported in the late 1980s shortly after the Expo Line opened, it would seem TransLink needs to find a permanent solution to avoid costly annual grinding, and/or premature rail replacement, to ensure the health of residents in nearby communities is not compromised.

Further investigation led police to a residence in Langley, and, on June 26, Burnaby RCMP’s prolific offender suppression team, strike force and frontline members descended on a Langley warehouse with a search warrant

They seized 3,200 pounds of rice, 26 pallets of sandals, 400 packages of paper towels, large quantities of toilet paper and diapers, one crate of ammunition and more than $1,500 in cash, according to the release.

Three people were detained and have since been released, according to Burnaby RCMP.

The investigation is ongoing, and charges will be forwarded to the B.C. Prosecution Service upon completion, police said.

“This warehouse contained a stockpile of stolen goods on a commercial scale and was located after diligent investigative efforts and coordination between a number of units at Burnaby RCMP,” Burnaby RCMP Insp. Matt Toews said in the press release.

You would be wrong.

article continues below

Living in a quiet, family-oriented Burnaby neighbourhood comes with it a sense of security. People feel safe walking the streets and letting their kids play. Neighbours watch out for each other.

For many, this is their forever neighbourhood precisely because of that feeling of security.

And so when a little crime wave hits, it hurts so much more than if you live in the crime central of Metrotown, which consistently has the worst stats for everything from B&Es to thefts from vehicles. Metrotown residents deserve better – they deserve to live in safety too - but it’s not exactly a surprise or a shock when thieves prey on this area.

For the folks who live in the leafy Montecito neighbourhood in North Burnaby, bordered approximately by Halifax, Duthie and Broadway, a rash of crimes this past week was really felt.

Someone I know contacted me about it and thought it might make a story. I agree.

Several of the townhouse complexes located just east of Montecito Elementary were hit by either one terrible person or several terrible people. It was mostly vehicles broken into and windows smashed.

The person or people responsible then rampaged over to the school and smashed up a bunch of windows that are now all boarded up.

The person who contacted me didn’t have much taken, other than some CDs (that made me laugh – what a score!) and two CO2 containers used to make drinking water bubbly. Strangely, the most valuable item in the vehicle, a child’s car seat, was left. Guess it was too much to carry.

Oh, and a camera in the vehicle was smashed, for some reason.

“It felt like one of those quick-buck, grab-anything things,” this person said.

Others weren’t as lucky.

So you’re probably reading this and wondering, “Well, so what?”

Well, since you asked, add it all up.

A bunch of ICBC claims. More money the Burnaby School District has to spend to repair windows that could go towards, I don’t know, buying more books.

The much-bigger thing that was stolen was the trust and security of the people who were victimized. And even those who didn’t have their homes or vehicles targeted will hear about it and they will feel less safe than they did before. I’m sure it’s also gone through people’s minds about what might have happened if one of the residents had accidentally stumbled upon the crimes while they were in progress.

Would the thief or thieves have assaulted a witness?

Then there’s also the feeling that someone who lives in the area might be responsible and could do it again.

Add it all up and it’s just a sad situation for everyone.

Brianne Amira called the Burnaby RCMP for an “emergency situation” in which she felt she required police attendance.

article continues below

“It wasn’t a matter of life and death - but serious enough that the assistance of RCMP was necessary,” Amira told the NOW. “In fact, it was recommended by an RCMP officer handing a separate, but related officer that I contact them for a new file, so I did exactly that.

“Upon reaching the non-emergency dispatch, I explained to her the history of the last file and that the office handling that particular file had requested me to call to get a new file created and for an officer to come to my residence. But rather than sending an officer to my home, the dispatcher spend a good five minutes berating me, telling me they don’t normally send officers for what I was calling in for, and that she would have to try to get a hold of the other officer to ensure that what I was telling her was true and that he did, indeed, request I call - making me feel as though she didn’t believe me. From there, I was put on hold for another 5 minutes until she finally came back on the line and advised me that she wasn’t able to get a hold of him, and begrudgingly started a new file and sent an officer to my home.”

Amira was shaken up after the call and decided to complain formally to the E-Comm 911 service that handles such calls.

“While this wasn’t a life-or-death situation, as mentioned, it easily could have been and, in my opinion, the actions of this call-taker significantly delayed police response.”

E-Comm 911 recently responded via email to Amira, saying it had reviewed the call in question and agreed that it was not handled properly.

“After reviewing the call, members of our quality assurance team have confirmed the call taker did not follow proper procedure and should have created a file right away,” said an email from E-Comm 911, a copy of which was provided to the NOW. “Moreover, the demeanor of our employee during the call did not reflect the level of professionalism that we expect from our call takers. This employee’s supervisor is now aware of our findings and will be following up with the call taker to review the matter and take appropriate actions.We take all caller concerns very seriously. I want to stress that this is not to our usual standard of care and we appreciate you reaching out and giving us the opportunity to look into and address this matter.”

Amira said she was hopeful that the call taker in question would receive further training to protect others in the future.

“My biggest concern isn’t for me, but for anyone else who might’ve had the misfortune of having this call taker and needing immediate assistance but not having their concerns taken seriously,” Amira said. “So my hope is that this call taker receives further training on how to properly handle calls in the future, and maybe learns to show a bit more compassion as well, as her demeanour with me was anything but that.”",[]

So complaining about something like the size of food portions while a restaurant is struggling seems like a terrible thing to do.

But people are doing it.

On Saturday, I wrote about Burnaby’s Anton’s Pasta staying open for takeout only and discussed the decisions restaurants have to make during this perilous time. I referenced the long history Anton’s has as the place with the “enormous portions” for its diners.

This blog was the most-read blog I’ve had in several months and generally the comments were positive about how good it is to see a Burnaby business making things work during a pandemic.

Sadly, several people decided to actually take the time to email me and whine about how they didn’t think Anton’s portions were as “enormous” as they used to be before the pandemic.

You. Have. Got. To. Be. Kidding. Me.

Whether it’s true or not, I don’t care. I saw people picking up their orders the other day and it looked like a full meal to me.

I've had a few other messages from some Burnaby residents complaining about other restaurants being too slow with service.

Imagine whining about a restaurant that is trying to hang on as they see a pandemic keep many of their customers at home. Imagine how clueless and insensitive you have to be to the plight of a restaurant owner to be this petty and entitled.

Restaurants are a tough business to be in during the BEST OF TIMES – let alone a pandemic - so maybe just pump the brakes on your complaining for a few minutes.

Support your local businesses. Tip well. And remember that many of them are hanging on for dear life.

The NOW reached out to former CIO Shari Wallace, but she said she was unable to comment due to the terms of her release.

According to her LinkedIn profile, Wallace was with the city from March 2013 until July 2020, a total of more than seven years.

Ishikawa didn’t specify which other positions were terminated, but an organization chart shown to the NOW by a city employee shows vacancies in several senior positions, including two directly reporting to the CIO and four second-level subordinate positions.

Ishikawa said the city expects to be recruiting a new CIO “shortly.”

This isn’t the only unexplained high-ranking departure from the city in recent months; the city’s fire chief, Joe Robertson, also left his position in March in a shroud of mystery after nearly a year on leave. He had served the city for 30 years.

A server at a Burnaby restaurant asked me for my name and phone number. This was done in case of a COVID-19 diagnosis and so Fraser Health could track and get in contact with diners.

article continues below

I was surprised because it’s the first time since I started dining out again on June 1 that a restaurant had asked me (a couple already had my details when I made a reservation).

All the others had not specifically asked, despite what health officials said they want when restaurants were allowed to reopen.

The province has urged restaurants to ""retain contact information for one member of every party of patrons for 30 days in the event that there is a need for contact tracing on the part of the medical health officer.""

In my experience, this is not happening. But it should. I know it’s a pain and some customers might freak out about it (they shouldn’t) but it’s an important part of dealing with COVID-19, especially during this reopening.

WorkSafeBC’s guidelines for the reopening cover sectors ranging from restaurants to offices, including guidance on how many people should be allowed in a business as well as controlling entry and exit points.

Al Johnson, the agency’s head of prevention services, said the guidelines were a “collaborative exercise” that included employers, retail and safety associations, restaurants, agriculture groups and government ministries.

In every industry, the guidelines emphasize having as little contact with customers as possible and ensuring social distance is maintained.

WorkSafeBC advises businesses to follow the protocol on gatherings, limiting events, such as museum tours, and working to establish safe occupancy limits.

It said specific guidelines for sports and recreation as well as child care will be released later.

But before reopening, the safety agency said businesses need to ensure they have a COVID-19 safety plan to protect workers and it must be displayed.

Johnson said every employer and business is different but the main safety issues revolve around the general principles of maintaining distance, and not just between workers but with members of the public as well. The principles also include good sanitation and hygiene, cleaning, and rethinking business practices.

“Undoubtedly, the devil is in the details when it comes to developing a plan, a safety plan ... so there will be questions, there will be people who need more information and we’re prepared,” Johnson said in an interview.

Employers should seek input from workers to ensure their concerns are addressed, he added.

About 300 prevention officers will oversee enforcement of the guidelines through unannounced inspections and taking complaints, he said.

“We want employers to succeed here so we are wanting to do everything with them and make sure employers have everything in place,” Johnson said.

If employers don’t have a health and safety plan or don’t intend to create one then WorkSafeBC will take action, he said.

“We will write orders and take them to sanction should we need to like any other health and safety violation in the workplace,” he said.

Penalties could include a ticket, an order, monetary sanction or even shutting down a business until a violation is corrected.

“We’re hoping it doesn’t come to that,” he said.

Johnson said employees have a right to refuse to go to work if they feel unsafe and should follow information on the WorkSafeBC website to file a complaint.

The agency says it will continue developing industry-specific guidelines as more businesses across B.C. begin reopening over the coming months.

Inside is still not great, as I see too many people in malls and stores not following Dr. Bonnie Henry’s guidelines. But outside? People seem to think that because they are outside that the rules simply don’t matter. As though fresh air kills the virus.

article continues below

Doug in Burnaby agrees.

The avid trail user – who didn’t want his last name used because he feared being attacked by trolls for speaking out – says people using Burnaby trails are not showing enough respect for others.

“I hoped that during a pandemic the incessant reminders of social distancing would sink in and everyone enjoying the outdoors would be kind and respectful to each other,” Doug said. “Apparently not for about a third of people. On a Sunday walk around Burnaby Lake, I encountered about a third who were so engaged in conversation or just oblivious to the common courtesy of falling into single file as my wife and I did whilst passing oncoming or overtaking others in order to maintain social distancing. A group of about 10 runners pounded past side by side owning the path.

“On their second trip around, it was me who stood my ground and it was me who got the dirty looks because I wasn’t making room for them who were running side by side. We are in a pandemic and we are so fortunate to be living in B.C. that has extremely low infection and hospitalization rates. Can people just be kind and considerate to take two steps to their right or left so we may keep it that way? A couple of kind steps is all I’m asking for.”

I’ve seen the same thing and that has kept me away from certain local trails. They aren’t wide enough to handle people walking side by side, and so many walkers and runners refuse to walk single file.

Just because you are outdoors doesn’t mean you can’t pass on COVID-19. Stay away from others.

Sure, it’s a bit of a hassle, but this is what we need to do.

The question was one faced by parents around British Columbia as their children’s schools sent out surveys asking one deceptively simple question: Do you intend to have your child return to in-class instruction starting June 1?

article continues below

It’s amazing how complicated one simple question can be.

For the record, I said No. My daughter isn’t returning for in-class instruction in New West on Monday. But I can’t remember the last time a simple question caused me so much what-iffing, but-waiting and on-the-other-handing.

My initial response to the news that schools were reopening their doors in June was one huge and enthusiastic “yahoo!” Our seven-year-old is an only child. She’s been learning at home since March break, while my husband and I have both been working remotely at jobs that have demanded more-than-full-time attention.

Finding a way to spend time with her has been, without a doubt, the single biggest challenge we’ve faced since we all came home for March break and never went back to our outside lives. Trying to engage and interact with her, to help her figure out the necessary technology, to make sure she’s on top of her assignments and gets her half-hour of reading done and writes her daily journal and checks out her virtual music lesson and doesn’t try to sneak extra YouTube videos in while she’s supposed to be doing Mathletics and then trying to think of ways we can all get fresh air and exercise and do something fun because you’re supposed to do something fun every day and why can’t I just bake cookies and if I was a good mom I would be baking cookies right now and helping her learn how to do more household chores and after all this pandemic isn’t supposed to be all bad I mean other people are having fun right now so why am I not having fun and why am I not sleeping and somebody hand me the Advil because I have a migraine and dammit I’m not supposed to take Advil now because wasn’t there something about Advil and COVID-19 so fine make it Tylenol and where is my coffee and

and

and

My right eye is twitching again just typing it all out.

Suffice it to say, sending our daughter back to school seemed like a good idea.

The thought that somebody else – somebody trained and qualified and good at teaching; somebody she’ll listen to and learn properly from instead of digging in her heels and resisting help – would take over her education? Yes, please.

And friends? In the solitary life of only children everywhere, Facetime and Messenger Kids have been her lifeline to other humans under the age of 10. And even though she’s an introvert at heart who enjoys her own space and keeps herself company pretty well, it’s not the same as spending time with other kids.

Returning to class, even part-time, could only be a win all around – for my husband, for me and for my daughter.

But wait.

We’re still in the midst of a viral pandemic. And, although all indications at this point are that the virus doesn’t transmit readily among groups of children, there are still a lot of question marks. What do we really know about how the virus will react until we try it out and see? And do I want my child to be part of one of those test groups? What if it all gets worse, fast, once groups of kids start assembling again? Do I want our family to come in contact with so many other people who may or may not have been taking social distancing as seriously as we have?

But wait.

I know the school district is taking its direction from people who know far more than I do. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control and public health officials and the Ministry of Education wouldn’t be clearing the return to school if they hadn’t decided, based on science and evidence, that it was possible to minimize and contain the risks.

But wait.

Even if our daughter does go back to school, will her friends be there? And will she really enjoy it, given how different the school day is going to look? If the kids aren’t allowed to work together and interact normally and play on the playground like they usually would, is she going to get the kind of social interaction that is at least half the reason we want to send her back? On the other hand, isn’t some social interaction, even limited and restricted interaction, better than none at all?

But wait.

If she doesn’t go back to school, can I keep doing this? Can I really make it through another month of muddling through home learning while I’m trying to navigate a full-time job? Can I handle being the “bad guy” every day (or, more accurately, taking turns with my husband being the bad guy) and forcing her to do the schoolwork she’d rather skip and dealing with the subsequent moods and attitude? Do I even want to try?

But wait.

Anxiety. She’s an anxiety-prone kind of kid, and we’ve finally managed to work through a lot of the anxiety she had – and, let’s face it, that we had - about the world turning upside down around us. We’ve found a bit of a “normal” in the way we live now, and we’re making it work (ish), so do I want to turn that all on its head, again, for the sake of a few weeks of school? If she takes a couple of weeks to get used to a new routine – and she always does – then is it even worth it for the little time that’s left in the school year?

But wait.

Is it fair to our daughter’s teacher to keep her home, when the teacher is going to be in class and ready to teach? Is it fair to my daughter to keep her home if her friends are going to be at school? Is it fair to me and my husband to keep her home when our jobs are still as demanding as ever? Is it fair that I even feel like all of this isn’t fair, given that we’re both employed and we have a home and we lack for nothing and we rate pretty damn high on the scale of pandemic privilege?

So yeah.

That “do you intend to send your child back to school” question was a simple one. It just didn’t come with a built-in guaranteed right answer.

In the end, our daughter’s own verdict that she’d rather continue learning at home tipped the balance for us. But even as I filled out “No” on the survey and sent it back to the school principal, I wondered if we were doing the right thing.

I still wonder.

It helps to know that our daughter is, after all, in Grade 2. Realizing that whatever decision we make, her entire academic future is not at stake here – well, that helps. And so does the fact that she has a dedicated and supportive teacher who has been 100% available to her students and their families since this crazy journey began. She’s assured us that our child will be fine, either way, and that she’s here to support the decision that works best for us.

So I feel good about our “No.” Mostly.

But let me be clear: I’m not casting judgment on anyone who said Yes and whose children will be back in school on Monday. I can think of a thousand reasons why parents want – and, in some cases, need – to have their children back in class. My decision isn’t intended to in any way cast aspersions on those reasons. I only hope that, by having families like ours step out of the in-class instruction part of learning, perhaps we can free up some of the teachers’ time and attention for those students who need that face-to-face contact more than we do.

We may still change our minds.

If COVID-19 has taught us nothing else, it has at least taught us that we can’t predict what life’s going to throw at us next. Everything may stay very much the same for the next month. Or everything could be upside down tomorrow.

All we can do is make the best decision for us right now, with the information we have available. And if something changes? Well, we’ll move on and do the next right thing – whatever that may be.

For all my fellow parents who’ve agonized over all of this too, solidarity. And for the teachers and administrators who have been working so phenomenally hard to make remote learning work and then to gear up for the return to class, all without missing a beat for our kids, my deepest gratitude.

As for my daughter? Well, she just got off a long Messenger Kids chat with her aunt in Toronto and is now, I suspect, sneaking YouTube videos instead of doing Mathletics.

But you know what? She’s done all her work for the week, and she’s not in any danger of losing her Grade 2 year if I give us both a break and let it go.

So I think I’ll pretend not to notice and have an iced coffee while I sit on the patio and proofread this post.

Here’s to the weekend – and here’s to Monday, whatever it may bring.",[]

Me too.

article continues below

I’m sitting here writing this post as an act of solidarity with all of the parents who are also muddling through the brave new world of working full-time from home while attempting something resembling “home schooling” with your children.

Let me preface this up front by saying this: I know what a fortunate position I am in. Right here, right now, this house has two partners who are both working full-time. We are caring for one child, we have a freezer and a pantry full of food, and we have enough tucked away for a rainy day that even if it all came crashing down tomorrow we’d be fine for the time being.

These are blessings that I don’t take for granted.

But, while my gratitude for full-time work (work that I love and happen to get a paycheque for) remains boundless, it also means that neither my husband nor I have the time to be as engaged and involved with our daughter as we’d like. All those marvellous lists of resources and educational ideas for parents that are going around social media? They’re awesome, but the chances of me having time to delve into them, let alone sit down and actually interact with my child to make most of them happen, are slim to none.

I do not need any posts about “how to make baking muffins an educational activity for your child” or “how you and your child can build a backyard rocketship.” What I need are basic strategies for survival. Period.

So I’m writing my own.

Thanks to some crowd-sourced wisdom from the New West Moms Group on Facebook, I have come up with this list of strategies to help you stay sane while you pretend this is a balancing act you can actually accomplish.

Take what will help you, discard what won’t, or just swear at me from the comfort of your own home if it’ll make you feel better.

Here, for what it’s worth, are my 10 survival strategies:

1. MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS A WORK SPACE.

Whether you have an actual “home office” or you’re working on a laptop in the living room, try to make sure everyone in the house has a defined work space – and that includes your child. Everyone needs a space where they can go to be (mostly) uninterrupted and where they can work without being distracted by others.

Be sure your children know that when you’re at your work space, you’re working and therefore not meant to be interrupted except for important questions. Offer them the same courtesy in return with their schoolwork space.

Consider making your own “Do Not Disturb” sign to hang next to you when you really need a designated amount of quiet time (for an important meeting, for instance).

No, you’ll never stop the “Moo-ooooom” questions. But the more you can provide visual cues that you are “at work” or “at school,” the more you can help your whole family separate those tasks from the “at home” hours – and the more fun it’ll be to hang out together when you’re all “at home” again in the evening.

Or, at least, you can tell yourself that. It hasn’t entirely worked for me yet, but I remain convinced that it’s a strategy that will pay off – eventually.

2. ACCEPT REALITY.

Reality #1: You’re not at your office, so your dream of uninterrupted time to focus on work is officially on hold. Indefinitely.

Reality #2: You’re not “home schooling.” You’re pinch hitting in a crisis, to the best of your ability (whatever that means for you), but unless you’re actually a teacher in real life, you’re not a teacher – and you didn’t just suddenly become one because your kid is sitting there staring expectantly at you expecting you to make this all make sense for her.

So work isn’t going to be “normal,” and neither is school. The faster you can accept both of those facts, the better off you’ll be.





3. COMMUNICATE.

Communicate with your own work team – your co-workers, your boss – and being clear about what you can and cannot achieve and when you can and cannot be available. No one (well, no one with any common sense and compassion) expects that you’ll be the exact same employee you are at the office when your child is safely ensconced at school or daycare. Everyone knows you will have some distractions and that maybe the old nine-to-five expectations are off the table right now. Talk to your team, if you need to, about how you can all help each other make this transition to working at home easier.

Even more importantly, communicate with your child’s teacher. That teacher is still guiding your child’s education, and he or she is now also struggling to navigate some very unfamiliar territory. Stay in touch. If you’re struggling to help your child, reach out. Chances are other parents are struggling, too, and the more honest we all are with the teachers in our lives, the more those teachers will be able to help us help our children.

And, above all, communicate to yourself. Repeat to yourself, as many times a day as you need to: I am not alone. We are in this together.

4. BE FLEXIBLE WITH YOUR HOURS.

How much of your work must be done at a certain time, and how much do you just stick to your routines because that’s how you’ve always done it? Your answer will be individual to your own situation, but, wherever possible, now’s the time to rethink the way your schedule works.

If you have a partner in the house, sit down and rethink your schedules together. Can one be the “more available” parent in the morning and one in the afternoon? Can some work get done in the evenings or on the weekends? Can you take longer lunch hours to give yourself a chance to play in the backyard or go for a walk with your child in the middle of the day? However you can free yourself up to give your child some attention and engagement during the day, it’s worth giving it a try.

And if that way fails? Then try something different. These days life is all about different. Go with it, and see what kind of new “normal” you can create for your own family in a world where nothing is normal at all.



5. SET UP A SCHEDULE.

Whether you’re the kind of person who likes to map out your day down to the minute or the kind who likes to go with the flow, everyone – especially the small humans in the house – will benefit from some kind of routine.

Decide how your household’s “schedule” is going to work. Whether it’s a list of tasks that can be accomplished in any order (which is how we like it), or whether it’s a specific hourly plan, commit that plan to paper and post it in a place where you can all see it.

My daughter’s in Grade 2; I know that her academic future won’t be irredeemably altered if she fails to complete her journal writing or her two tasks in Mathletics today. But having those expectations written down on a task list helps her, because she can take her checklist and run with it while I do my own work (and, yes, answer the inevitable questions that arise while she’s working).

Another help for us? Build rewards into your schedule to keep everyone motivated. For my kidlet, it’s earning extra screen time by finishing academic, creative and household tasks. For me, it’s sitting down with a glass of Naramata rosé and a satisfying murder mystery novel to end my evening.



6. KEEP EVERYONE FED.

Snacks, snacks and more snacks. Make sure your day, and your child’s, includes food.

It seems like a foolish thing to say, but it’s amazing to me how often I can “forget” to eat when I get engrossed in something work-related. And if you have a child who, like mine, suffers from a bad case of the hangries when food doesn’t arrive on time, you want to be prepared.

However you choose to provide that food is up to you. Maybe your household works best with specific snack items set out in easy-to-reach bins for the kids so they can grab their own food when they need it. Maybe you’re more of a fridge free-for-all family or a formal-sit-down-meal household. Whatever your style, just keep everyone nourished and hydrated.

And then do it all again tomorrow. And the next day. And the next day. And the one after that.



7. GET OUTDOORS AND GET MOVING.

Your child needs fresh air, and so do you. And, here on the West Coast, we’ve been blessed by the arrival of spring in all its cherry-blossom-and-magnolia-tree glory. So get outside, every day. Twice a day if you can. Whether that means taking a longer lunch to get outdoors together, going for an early-morning jog or taking to your neighbourhood streets for an after-work stroll, make sure you get out and give yourselves that brain break.

And get moving. Crank the tunes and throw yourselves a dance party, search out some yoga on YouTube, or whatever it takes to work out your body and shake off some stress. Heck, just run laps around the yard or the living room if it helps.

Tire out all the bodies in your house, and hopefully all the minds will sleep better.

8. RELAX SCREEN TIME RIGIDITY.

I know, I know, you have screen time limits for a reason, and so do I. But we can all allow ourselves to relax those limits – at least a little - right about now.

If you absolutely need your child to stay out of your hair while you’re in a Zoom meeting, or you have two hard hours of work to complete on a tight deadline, then maybe a movie on the TV or a half-hour of precious games on the iPad will be the solution to buy you the time you require.

If your child is a bookworm who loves reading more than screen time, then embrace the magical unicorn that you are raising and let her go to town on books instead. But for the rest of us mortals? Screen time may be just the break we need.

9. LAUGH.

Seriously, just start laughing now, because it’s all crazy, and someday it’ll have to be funny because if it’s not funny you’ll just start crying and you might not stop.

So find the funny side, fast. And if you can’t find the funny side in your daughter’s attempt to dress the cats in Easter outfits or in your own attempts to produce home baking, then turn to the experts and put on your favourite funny TV show or podcast, or seek out some comedy on YouTube. Or something. Anything to get the giggles going.

Embrace this new life you are leading, in all its bizarre gloriousness, and laugh. And, yes, laughter tinged with overtired maniacal hysteria is still laughter.

10. ALLOW YOURSELF THE GRACE TO BE IMPERFECT.

You’re going to suck at this sometimes. Probably even a lot of the time. You’re going to be stressed, frazzled and emotional. You may lose your patience with your child, forget to return a phone call, or not remember what day it is. And you may do all of those things with or without a shower, with or without clean hair, and with or without pants.

You are not in fact an incurable mess. You are just a human being, navigating what is undoubtedly the strangest time in your personal history. It’s OK if that contact has to wait a few hours for an email, or if your child does not in fact finish her two tasks in Mathletics today.

Her future and yours do not depend upon perfection. They depend only upon you showing up and doing your best, whatever that looks like today.

That’s it. That’s all I’ve got. And if you see a frazzled-looking mom with her unwashed hair in a messy ponytail wearing the same leggings she’s been wearing for a week and dragging a whining blonde seven-year-old around the neighbourhood for a walk, that’s probably me.

Feel free to say hi. I’ll say hi back, and I promise I’ll even smile.

We may or may not actually have this whole situation in hand. But whatever happens, remember: we’re all in this together.",[]

But right now, it just pisses me off.

article continues below

When I see a troop of teens huddled together on the beach, sharing drinks and scooching closer to snap selfies, it doesn’t make me miss my high school days, it makes my stomach turn.

This isn’t a snow day, and it’s not the spring break social time that we’ve come to expect during this time of year.

We have yet to see the worst of this global pandemic, and while some seem to be brushing off the warnings by the authorities, I’m starting to take their ignorance personally.

COVID-19 is spreading quickly, and we’ve been urged to stay home and act as though we’ve already contracted the contagious disease.

Many cases are mild enough that the carrier doesn’t realize that they’ve been infected. One visit to a family member or friend, and the virus is passed on, and the spread continues.

In one of her latest updates, Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, urges residents to stay home, and only go out for essential trips such as to the grocery store. She emphasized that it’s alright to go for walks, but only with the members that live in your household.

Playdates are not ok. Coffee dates with friends are unacceptable. Crowding into public spaces - even if they are outdoors, is not practicing social distancing. Continuing to do these things will put our province in the same position as Italy, with rapidly spiking cases and increasing death rates by the hour. We could be where they are, only weeks from now, if we don’t start listening to the cautions today.

Physicians are working together to help spread the word, encouraging everyone to stay indoors. In an email sent to my aunt by her own physician, the content reads, “The time to act is now. Our province is in a state of emergency. What we do today will impact the health of British Columbians in the weeks to come. Stay home unless absolutely necessary. No dinner parties. No shopping. No sports, not even outside. Instead, have coffee with a friend online. Keep six feet or two metres away from everyone at all times. Call your loved ones and tell them to do the same.

Remind young people in your life that they can get sick from this virus. More importantly, they can be carriers and cause a lot of harm to parents, grandparents, and other loved ones.”

I get it, your kids are bored. Your teens are craving social interactions, and you need to separate stir crazy siblings. But it’s time to listen to the experts.

Our city shouldn’t have to tape up playgrounds, close down coffee shops, and barricade beaches to get you to stay home.

Because the only thing more annoying than staying home, is knowing that other people aren’t.

She didn’t seem concerned, more just curious about the introduction of a new word to her ever-growing vocabulary, and as she looked back down at her Lego structure that she was building, I realized that it was time to be honest with her.

article continues below

Because while I’ve spent the last couple of weeks hovered over my computer, watching live Q&A broadcasts with the World Health Organization (WHO), reading updates on the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) website, and following the latest travel advisories posted on Health Canada, my kids have been mostly in the dark about the quickly-spreading disease.

Last week we cancelled what was going to be our first-ever family trip abroad, a two-week trek through the south of France for spring break, and since then, our plans have been ever-changing. Maybe we’ll just go to Palm Springs or Phoenix instead? Nope, increased cases in the US. Maybe we’ll visit another province in Canada? Nope, air travel is not recommended. A ferry to Victoria? Social distancing doesn’t recommend time spent in such close quarters with so many people.

As I write this, the coronavirus has spread to 146 countries, with over 153,000 confirmed cases around the world - 73 of which are right here in BC. Things are changing by the hour, and while we’re all, for the most part, trying to remain calm, most of our kids are concerned, curious, or confused as they watch us as we watch things evolve.

It’s time to be open and honest with our kids about the coronavirus and all that’s happening around the world. They need to know why they can’t go to Science World, or hang out at the mall, and they need to know the severity of the situation.

Start by asking them questions to find out what they know - or think they know already. Then, let’s not just tell them to wash their hands, but explain why it’s more important than ever right now. Let’s explain to them that it’s not just about us getting sick, but about the people around us who are already sick or immunocompromised too. Let’s make sure they know that it’s not ok to make jokes about COVID-19 as the global death toll continues to rise.

Let’s tell our kids where to find the facts, and not to listen to the fiction that is filling their ears from friends and on social media platforms. Let’s explain the border closures and self-quarantines and stockpiling that’s happening, and let’s also show them videos of how people are coming together, supporting small businesses, providing for their sick neighbours who need help, and using this pandemic to come together as a community.

And then let’s comfort them, let them know that we’re here to answer their questions, and that we’ll do our best to keep them healthy and safe. And let’s follow through with that promise, because friends, this is only the beginning.

Burnaby Mayor Mike Hurley and Coun. Joe Keithley – a.k.a. D.O.A. frontman Joey Shithead – teamed up recently to compose their new song, We’re All in This Together. Last week, the city released a video of the two playing the song in Deer Lake Park with a safe two metres between them.

Now, the song is available for download on iTunes, with all proceeds going toward the Greater Vancouver Food Bank. The move comes after the duo’s performance saw a strong performance on social media – the video has been seen more than 33,000 times in five days, according to the city.

“It’s great to see that this song resonates with people,” said Hurley in a news release. “This is a time when we find out what we’re made of, and I think people share the feeling that we need to come together and support each other.”

The city described the song as a “salute to the resilience and perseverance of residents during the COVID-19 crisis and a rallying call.” It was largely written by Keithley, who performed lead vocals and guitar, while Hurley played the bass and sang backup vocals.

""In this time of crisis it's really crucial that we support our neighbours, and the Greater Vancouver Food Bank does such a great job at supporting those in need,” said Keithley. “So I'm really happy that the proceeds from the We're All in This Together single goes to support the food bank.”",[]

The song is intended to “celebrate the spirit of our communities and our frontline workers,” according to a news release from the city, which describes the song as “a passionate, upbeat song for our times.”

“Joe wrote this great song, and I hope it energizes and fortifies people to stay strong,” said Hurley. “It captures the community’s grit and determination that we see all around us today, and calls on us to double down on our commitment to each other and beat COVID-19.”

The duo – the sole Burnaby Green Party councillor and an independent mayor – performed the song (with the appropriate distance between them) for a video at Deer Lake Park.

“The song is both a salute to the resilience and perseverance of residents during the COVID-19 crisis and a rallying call,” reads the city’s news release, pointing to the lyrics in the chorus:

We’re all in, this together

We’ve got to brave, this stormy weather

You can count on us, we’re your neighbours

We’re all in, this together

“Writing this song was just natural as I saw the growing effort by our fellow Canadians to keep as many folks as possible safe throughout the pandemic,” said Keithley. “It's my way of thanking and expressing my admiration for the nurses, doctors and all the front line workers. They are the best!”

D.O.A. and Keithley are considered among the founders of punk music – particularly in Canada – having kicked off in 1978. The band is famous for its strong political stances and history of activism, embodied in its slogan: TALK-ACTION=0.

Hurley, a lifelong guitar player, has had his own forays into the music scene – well, sort of. In November 2019, he brought his own song – Burnabarians – to the Burnaby Board of Trade’s business excellence awards.",[]

“It brings a little normalcy to the kids and a little bit of fun. Even if they’re stuck inside and they can’t have Grandma and Grandpa over, they can still do something as a family,” she said of the holiday.

The company is charging a flat rate of $10 shipping in B.C. for Easter orders that are $75 or more, according to the company’s website.

“Right now we’re trying to promote to B.C. and our local people who can’t get out,” Sigvardsen said.

But the company is also offering pickup at its locations, she added.

“Actually, that’s quite popular,” she said, adding it allows people to pick up chocolate items such as hollow bunnies, which are more fragile.

“So that allows people to pretty much pick and choose from anything as long as it’s not a made-to-order item,” Sigvardsen said.

Made-to-order items require production to be running, and it is closed for now, she said.

“We were ready for Easter before this hit,” she said. “We’re very lucky, very stocked up.”

The company has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic financially but has had a lot of support from its customers, Sigvardsen said.

“As a small business we really appreciate our customers sharing. We’ve had a lot of people who’ve forwarded either our Instagram post or created their own and sent it to all their friends, saying we’re still open, and we very much appreciate that,” she said. “We were built on word of mouth from our customers.”

The company’s hours for pickup may change, and they have yet to decide if they’ll open their doors before Easter, so customers are advised to check the website.

“We have to take into account our staff as well as the people who come in,” Sigvardsen said. “We have everybody from kids to seniors.”

Along the trail behind Forest Grove Elementary School, in the woods and throughout the neighbourhood, you can find the creations of the children of Forest Grove – pretty painted rocks, some with messages, all part of a special treasure hunt during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A neighbour suggested the idea of a scavenger hunt for kids to Clare Zeschky, creator of the private Facebook group, The Great Forest Grove Covid19 Treasure Hunt.

“I’d been thinking about the things we could do, because I know in other places they’ve been doing the hearts in windows and the rainbows and it was all really cute,” she said. “But a couple of summers ago, when I was on holiday with my mom and dad in York, my dad got (my daughter) Lara to paint all these little stones and we left them around the city walls. So we popped them into crevasses in the city walls for people to find.”

It’s an ideal activity for children because it involves collecting, painting, and hunting for rocks, she said.

“It was a full-scale thing that kids can get into instead of just painting a rainbow to put in a window,” Zeschky said. “It was an activity that could keep kids going for quite awhile and take some of the stress off parents.”

The group is popular in the small neighbourhood, with 54 members as of Monday, March 30 at 11 a.m. Zeschky allows in members who live in the neighbourhood, and others on a case-by-case basis.

“It was something that kids could really get involved in and grownups in the community as well, because I know there are quite a few grownups taking part, too,” Zeschky said. “It’s really kind of taken off and is running itself, and there’s lots of people involved. Every day there’s someone new putting a stone out there and it seems the kids are moving them around so you can find them in different places.”",[]

So he decided to give classes.

“I couldn’t really help out any other way. I’m not fit enough to go out and get groceries for people,” he said, adding people in his strata have been doing so. “Tai chi is so good for everything to do with the immune system and we’ve got this thing going around.”

As a certified tai chi instructor and kung fu sifu (master), Lagerstrom thought the best way he could help those at his strata was to get them moving.

“I kept seeing tai chi classes shut down everywhere,” he said, adding, “I’m lucky enough to live in a strata with a nice big tennis court.”

Lagerstrom lives in Brent Gardens on Halifax Street in Burnaby and is offering free tai chi classes to strata members and their families.

The space allows for more than two metres (6.5 feet) between each participant, he said.

Tai chi helps aid breathing, blood pressure and immune function, he added.

He has written approval from the strata, Lagerstrom said.

“At this point, even if they aren’t keeping it open for tennis, apparently we can keep it open for tai chi,” he said of the tennis courts.

This is a calming way to help others, he added.

“Teaching tai chi a couple of times a week, that’s way less of a commitment than being on strata council,” he said, adding he had previously been on his council.

He had his first student participate on Saturday.

He’ll continue teaching twice a week as long as possible, he said.

“As long as I’m allowed and as long as I’m physically able,” Lagerstrom said.

Classes are on Tuesdays and Saturdays at 10 a.m.",[]

The society runs the Burnaby Farmers’ Market as well as others in the region.

article continues below

The decision came from the city’s director of planning and building, according to Glemas.

The director, Ed Kozak, did not respond to the NOW before press time to confirm that.

“The safety of everybody is always a prime concern,” Glemas said. “We are skipping this week, possibly next week, and then regrouping.”

The B.C. Association of Farmers’ Markets is holding a conference call next week about the possibilities going forward, he said.

In Nova Scotia, Farmers' Markets of Nova Scotia has asked markets to shut down their physical locations but is helping them move to an online model, Glemas pointed out.

“There are possibilities of online ordering,” he said.

The main two issues are ensuring the food supply chain is not limited and ensuring their members can still make a living, according to Glemas.

“Farmers and vendors rely on the markets for part of their income,” he said.

As for the supply chain, providing food is an essential service, he pointed out, adding that farmers’ markets are open-air markets, and they provide more of an opportunity for social distancing while food shopping.

Domestic food security, food production and local farmers are of high importance at times like these, an online letter from the society pointed out.

The society has been following guidelines from Fraser Health and the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, the letter stated.

“In Monday’s letter from the BCCDC, they express that ‘farmers’ markets are not currently considered a high-risk setting for the transmission of COVID-19’ and I understand the B.C. Ministry of Agriculture is also supportive of farmers’ markets remaining open at this time,” the letter stated.

“Under additional conditions regarding COVID-19, farmers markets can continue to operate in B.C. at this time,” agricultural minister Lana Popham said in a statement posted on Twitter. “The Ministry of Agriculture is working directly with the BC Association of Farmers’ Markets to assist with this season and I’m pleased to share that the Ministry of Agriculture will be providing financial support for them to develop an operating model better suited to times of emergency.”

Whatever the association decides is best, the Burnaby Farmers’ Market will listen, Glemas said.

“I would encourage other farmers’ markets to take a unified approach,” he said. “The key thing is doing whatever is best for the community.”

“I think everybody needs to make a bit of an effort and try to slow this down as much as we can,” she told the NOW. “Our concerns are always with our medical resources, we don’t want them overwhelmed, right?”

The closure is not because business has dropped off, though, she said.

“People were coming in before self-isolating and getting their books to read,” Powell said.

For those who want to help the shop after the pandemic, she said the answer is simple.

“Just showing their support by shopping locally is always huge,” she said. “We have a really great community, lots of fantastic customers, they come in and place new book orders.”

While the store carries a limited number of new books, it can always order books in, she said.

“The big box stores can’t hold a candle to our selection, though,” Powell said of the new and used book store.

She hopes the store won’t be closed for long.

“We’re hoping if we can all get a handle on this it’ll only be a closure for a couple of weeks and we can all weather the storm together,” Powell said.

Brown’s Books, west of Companion Books, is keeping its doors open for now, according to owner Roger Brown.

The used book store is located at 3740 Hastings St. The hours may possibly change, he said, so call ahead to check. The phone number is 604-294-9311.

All Indigo books stores in the city, such as Chapters and Coles, are closed until at least March 27, according to the Indigo website.

However, a couple of Vancouver bookstores and one Tri-Cities store are delivering books to Metro Vancouver, including Burnaby.

Both Massy Books and Iron Dog Books have posted on Facebook that they are delivering books during this time.

Massy Books closed its storefront on Georgia Street but is doing free deliveries to areas throughout the region, according to owner Patricia Massy.

“We’re doing deliveries three days a week,” she said, adding people can still order books through the bookstore.

She pointed out that Amazon is focusing on priority items such as household staples and medical supplies; and is not focused on delivering books right now.

The store, which is 100% Indigenous owned and operated, can ship to anywhere in Canada and the United States as well, for a fee.

In addition to shipping her own books, Massy is helping out a fellow bookstore owner, Don Stewart, who owns the iconic MacLeod’s Books in Vancouver.

Customers can call the store at (604) 681-7654 to order their books, pay over the phone, and Massy will deliver them.

MacLeod’s doors are still open, and Massy says she understands why some bookstores are going that route.

“We decided to close because we thought it was the right thing to do, but I get that it’s very difficult to make that decision,” she said, pointing out that bookstores operate on a slim profit margin. “I completely understand why people are still open.”

Go to www.massybooks.com for information on how to order.

Iron Dog Books is closed for browsing at its shop in the Hastings-Sunrise neighbourhood but does allow book pick up and has extended its free delivery to Burnaby, according to co-owner Hilary Atleo.

Orders can be placed through irondogbooks.com.

And Western Sky Books in Port Coquitlam is also delivering to Burnaby at this time, according to owner Tamara Gorin.

“Yes we are,” she said. “We do have customers in Burnaby.”

The store is doing deliveries on Wednesdays and Fridays currently, she said, adding, “we’re taking it day by day.”

The layout of the store is such that social distancing is possible, so they’re staying open for now. They’re following all the health precautions set out by the health authorities and the province, Gorin said.

Instead, we’re offering a bit more of a philosophical approach – handy tools to maintain peace of mind in a world that’s changing by the hour.

article continues below

1. Laugh.

Even as we face uncertain times – and these truly are unprecedented times – it’s important to keep your sense of humour. Aside from regular washing, this might be the most important thing you can do as we retreat into our homes and away from the community, doing our part to slow the spread of COVID-19. Laughter is the language of the soul, as Pablo Neruda once said, but it’s also sustenance for the soul.

2. Talk.

There’s a reason extended solitary confinement is viewed as torture. Even the most stable among us can succumb to cabin fever. If laughter is sustenance for the soul, talking is sustenance for the mind. We may be divided by the walls of our homes, but we don’t have to be emotionally divided. Call your loved ones. Tell them how you’re feeling and ask them the same.

3. Learn.

A still mind grows stagnant, and while movies or video games or music can fill some time, learning about the world around you is both productive and satisfying. The universe is at your fingertips, and it’s never been easier to explore the depths of the oceans, the far-flung reaches of the galaxy or the minutiae of the building blocks of life and the universe – right from your home.

4. Walk away.

We know as well as anyone the news these days is alarming, and the deluge of it on social media makes for especially distressing times. Keep an eye on the news, but take a break from social media and get away from the constant flow of “BREAKING,” “JUST IN” and “NEW.” And don’t believe everything you see on the internet.

5. Wash.

This is likely the most important piece of advice going around right now. Health experts say to wash your hands for 20 seconds using warm water and soap. This should be done frequently, especially if you’ve been out and if you’ve touched things like a public door handle or hand rail. Speaking of which, try to use your sleeves for opening doors and practice greetings without a handshake or even an elbow-bump.",[]

She died on Dec. 15. She was 99.

Arnold, best known for the iconic swinging girl sign she commissioned (which still swings over the neighbourhood, though it now says Heights) and the store she ran, was a fixture in the neighbourhood from 1958 to 2008, according to Burnaby Heights Merchants Association executive director Isabel Kolic.

“As you know, she was a businesswoman here since the 1950s,” she said. “She was really well known in the neighbourhood, both as a salesperson – because people shopped there from all over the region, not just Burnaby – but also for just being a really kind and caring woman and member of the community.”

She added that people remembered her and her husband fondly.

Jack Kuyer, owner of Valley Bakery, remembered her help getting Hats Off Day off the ground.

""When Helen was in business, I considered her a business friend. She was always very supportive. In the early days, when we were getting Hats Off Day started, she was one of the first ones on board. She just wanted to work with the merchants in the area,” he said. “She was very proud of her business. She loved being the icon that she became.”

Her family was well-known in the neighbourhood as well, he said.

“Her husband also frequented the Heights. They did their shopping in this community,” Kuyer said. “She was warm, very social, smiling – always interested in what was going on in the community.""

Rino Cioffi, owner of Cioffi’s Group, remembered her as a kind person.

“Helen was awesome, a real sweetheart. She came up to me when she was retiring and told me, ‘I promised your dad that I would sell him this building,’” Cioffi said. “My dad had already passed away some years earlier, but she kept her promise. She pulled out the BC assessment and said, ‘Just pay me this.’”

He was saddened by the news that she had died.

“She was also so generous and always gave our girls her special collectible dolls at Christmas. That's the kind of woman she was,” he said. “I am really sad to learn of her passing and was quite upset that I didn't find out sooner.”

“I want to keep people informed about the latest news,” he told the NOW. “That’s my goal, that people will be aware of what’s happening right now, and to help the community.”

The Port Coquitlam resident studied computer systems technology at the institute, and learned the skills he used to create the app at an internship, he said.

He spends most of his time applying for jobs but took a little more than two days to create the application, which he continues to update and modify.

Kim decided to make the app after spending a lot of time on his own researching COVID-19 and reading numerous news stories, he said.

Some of the data was outdated and some was difficult to read, he added.

“It (is) a serious worldwide issue, considering the speed (of the spread of the virus),” he said. “I felt like I wasn’t the only one who felt this way.”

He decided to create the platform as a way to help the community stay informed while also demonstrating his skills, he said.

He sources his data from the World Health Organization, Johns Hopkins, the Government of Canada website, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, and other websites.

Kim, who comes from South Korea and has relatives there, said he is keeping up on the news there, as South Korea has the second highest amount of COVID-19 cases after China.

“Honestly, I’m kind of scared about this,” he said regarding the virus.

She frantically grabs her phone, shouting into it, “trace that licence plate!”

Soon after, she tracks him down, breaking open the door to his cabin. Another case solved.

This kind of scenario plays well on screens and pages but it’s not how things go in real life. In real life, being a private investigator is a whole different story.

“I don’t think a lot of the public knows what P.I.s actually do,” Burnaby private investigator Jolene Johnson told the NOW. “It’s not like the movies, it’s not like the TV shows coming out, it’s nothing like that.”

Johnson has been a private investigator for five years and has run National Risk Management Group Ltd. since 2018. The Burnaby resident employs four fully licensed private investigators and one private investigator under supervision in B.C. and Alberta. She also has licensed security staff in Alberta.

One aspect of the work of the private investigator is locating people, and much of that work is done online, she said.

“We do surveillance, that’s one piece of it. We do witness statements, that’s another piece of it,” Johnson said. “We do covert investigations but we don’t have any actual power like law enforcement, for example.”

One of the major differences between fictional P.I.s and actual investigators working in the private sector is that there are limitations on what they can do, she said.

“People think private investigators have all kinds of abilities to do this, that and the other thing on a file but really we don’t,” Johnson said. “We have no authority whatsoever.”

For instance, private investigators can’t run licence plates or do driver’s licence searches, she pointed out.

“There’s no power that I have that you don’t have as a private citizen, there’s nothing. The only thing is I’m licensed by the provincial government and I’m insured,” she explained. “My licence only gives me the right to charge money for services. And it also only gives us the ability to legally follow from place to place.”

In B.C, repeatedly following someone is a criminal offense for those without a private investigator’s licence.

“If a subject becomes aware that we are following them, and they get afraid, then it’s a criminal offence,” Johnson said.

Private investigators don’t buddy up with investigating officers for intel or help on a case, either, she said.

“We don’t work with police,” Johnson said. “If police stop one of our people doing surveillance, we are not allowed to disclose who we’re working on. We do tell them, ‘we’re on surveillance, here is our plate number.’ But we’re not allowed to legally disclose to the police what we’re doing.”

However, if the police have a file they’re working on in the area and the private investigator is impeding that, they do stop, according to Johnson.

However, the one element of fictional P.I. stories that rings true is the havoc it can wreak on an investigator’s personal life, so Johnson is very careful to help her employees with that side of things.

Because a lot of work they do involves sensitive material, Johnson allows her employees to disclose to their partners what kind of file they’re working on, though no personal details are shared.

“In some cases we’re investigating adult-oriented material where a subject may be involved in escorting. So that type of assignment, a male employee would have to go into that kind of environment and again, it raises havoc in relation to relationships as well,” she said. “The partner may not know this is work related, or ‘is my husband stepping out on me?’ So they can’t know who the file is on, but the type of file, we definitely allow our employees to disclose the type of file because at the end of the day, we Google weird things.”",[]

Kim Yuen was lucky enough to build a career with a company willing to help her achieve “work-life integration,” she told the NOW.

She was posting an ad on Craigslist for her husband’s company, while she was taking time off with her children, when she saw a job close to her children’s school.

“My boss is so empathetic to working women and our need to feel relevant and have challenging work and to also appreciate our family commitment,” she said. “So he clearly put that on the post, and I thought, oh my gosh, that’s perfect.”

Veer Business Advisors Ltd. is a business transition advisory firm focused on business exits. Yuen, who has a background in management consulting, is a business adviser with the company.

“We have a philosophy of results matter more than time in the office,” she said.

They need to be in the office for team and client meetings, but otherwise, they can work from home or wherever they wish, Yuen explained.

They also have a digital workplace, as well as a focus on employee emotional wellness and physical health.

The focus on work-life integration is there for all employees, not just working mothers, Yuen pointed out.

“We like to see it as accessing talent because myself and my co-workers, we have a lot to offer, and businesses and entrepreneurs like my boss understand that,” she said.

But with working mothers in particular, Yuen has noticed some take jobs that limit them and don’t use their skill sets, because they need more flexible schedules.

“I hear a lot of moms who, after they have kids, change careers or just give up on finding work that’s rewarding to them, and it’s unfortunate because women have so much to offer,” she said, “and it’s just a matter of finding a company that’s going to take advantage of that opportunity to have you with them.”

Stefanie Poli, an administrative assistant with Cameray Child and Family Services, found her employer was very understanding when she became pregnant a month after returning from her first maternity leave.

“They’ve just been incredibly positive when I got pregnant again, going off again, and my second mat leave was two years, and they were wonderful when I came back again the second time,” she said.

Finding child care for two children was the hardest challenge, Poli said, and she ended up working out a part-time work schedule with her supervisor.

They’ve also been very understanding about retraining her after her return from her second maternity leave, she added.

The employer has good policies in place, which is key, Poli said. Employees are able to take a second year of unpaid maternity leave if they wish, and work schedules are also flexible from week to week. They can also use paid sick leave when their kids are sick, and take unpaid leave once that runs out.

Work culture is also essential, she said.

“I feel so lucky to work in an environment where we practise what we preach,” she said of Cameray, which encourages clients to maintain a healthy work/family balance.

Employers such as Jolene Johnson, owner of National Risk Management Group Ltd., make it a priority to work with their employees’ schedules.

The group provides private investigation services in B.C. and Alberta, and security services in Alberta.

Everybody has to work, she said. “I have an investigator who’s a family man who has a four-month-old at home, and he’s got other kids as well. So what we try to do is accommodate his schedule so he can be home with his kids.”

This is different than a lot of employers who expect employees to always work around them, Johnson pointed out.

“We do it differently, and the reason why we do it differently is because at the end of the day everybody has to work but everybody, if you have a happy wife or happy husband at home, the employee is more productive,” she said.

The business is one that allows for some schedule flexibility, she added.

“One of the services we provide is we locate people, and so a lot of times we will get moms who are wanting to get back in the workforce but they still have their little ones at home, but there’s such a dynamic when it comes to child care in the Burnaby area, specifically,” Johnson said. “And so a lot of times these parents, as much as they want to get back to work, they can’t financially afford to because of a) not being able to find a proper daycare or childcare spot or b) they just simply don’t make enough money. So we actually employ individuals who work from home, and they’re surfing the net locating people. “

These employees have to have a criminal record check just like employees that work in the office and are vetted the same way, she said.

While employees can sometimes take advantage of a more flexible schedule, it’s not very common, according to Johnson.

“Everybody comes with their own dynamics,” she said. “But I look at their ability. Everybody has an asset, everybody needs to work, because you have to pay the bills. I’ll hire people that have mental health issues, that have anxiety, that maybe only can work a couple of days a week.”

This leads to better working relationships overall, she explained.

“I find if you provide a stable work environment, a healthy work environment, and your understanding of your employees’ issues, then you’re going to have a long-lasting employer/employee relationship with that individual,” Johnson said.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

How do we want to be remembered ourselves? What are the puzzle pieces that will create a full picture of a life well lived and a sense of celebration in memory?

That’s the question behind a new program at Forest Lawn Funeral Home, a division of Dignity Memorial, called Life Well Celebrated.

“We talk with every family when they came in, to find out what’s important to them – what will help personalize the service, what will make it a valuable time, what will help them through the full process, and how do we create something that is as individual as the person,” said Andrew Knapman, manager at Forest Lawn. “It’s really about helping families find meaning, to help them share more of who that person was, and to celebrate that life.”

Knapman notes that they are able to provide a wide variety of services and options, ranging from more traditional, spiritual, or religious ceremonies, to more secular memorials and celebrations of life.

“There’s really a spectrum of options, depending on what’s important to people,” he said. “But ultimately we want to help people find meaning – these are often life-changing times, sometimes unexpected. It’s critical to us that we help people through that in the way that will work the best for them.”

For Knapman and his team, that goes far beyond the final details and begins as soon as people contact them.

“We want them to feel comfortable and supported from the very start,” he said.

That means having compassionate, caring and knowledgeable staff, but it also includes creating systems that help make the process easier to navigate. This year, they have implemented a new program in which families can see, on a large video screen, what kinds of options and possibilities are available, while discussing it.

“It seems like a small thing but it can be a challenging time, so to be able to give them all of the pertinent information, so that they can really see and experience what their options are, can help people make decisions more easily, which makes it less stressful,” he said.

To that end, Knapman also notes that there is a steady increase in the number of people who make prearrangement plans for themselves.

“Often it is people who have themselves had to make arrangements for a loved one and they realize how valuable it would have been to have plans in place, and they begin to think about what they want for themselves,” he said. “We have pre-planning advisers who work much as a funeral director does, but in advance, when no one is grieving, and they can think about what their wishes are.”

Forest Lawn Funeral Home was established in 1965 as a chapel located in the centre of the cemetery grounds, adjacent to Royal Oak Avenue. A funeral home was added to the site in the late ’70s; several years ago, the facility received a major renovation to upgrade the building and interior.

The area is known for its peaceful setting – sloping lawns, greenery, and quiet beauty – along with a central location for ease of visiting.

There are decisions to make about educational paths, housing and employment. Many young adults have support systems (whether it’s parents and/or extended family members) to help them through.

But for the 700 young adults aging out of foster care every year, which happens at age 19 in B.C., the challenges are even more dire. Along with a roster of social barriers, youth aging out of foster care often don’t have networks that can facilitate access to rental housing, such as parents who can act as guarantors to sign leases. “You don’t have any of the main things a landlord on a screening application would require, and you’re trying to compete with people who do,” says Christina Grammenos, Community Engagement Coordinator for Aunt Leah’s Place, a charity organization that for 30 years has been dedicated to preventing youth homelessness.

article continues below

To answer this need, in 2016 Aunt Leah’s Place created the Friendly Landlord Network, a web portal which connects young adults age 19 to 30 who are looking to live in safe, affordable housing with community-minded landlords.

The online system, which acts as an internal market for youth and non-profits around the Lower Mainland representing young adults, allows landlords to post information about available housing. “We can post the unit up on the (site) and that way through the 19 partner organizations, someone is going to have a young adult who fits the location and price range and style of unit, so we can find a good fit,” Grammenos explains.

Along with supporting youth through their house-hunting process, the Friendly Landlord Network also provides support to landlords including guidance on tenancy rights and responsibilities. The organization also commits to doing a physical check-in once a month for the first six months.

While a number of youth have found long-term housing through the network, Grammenos says, “We’d really like to get more private landlords, more property managers and building owners.”

Once stable housing is secured, the doors open to other possibilities for youth. As Brendan, 21, who has found a home through the Friendly Landlord Network puts it: “To me, having a home represents stability. You can't do anything if you're constantly worrying about where you'll sleep this month, this week, or even today. A nice home is the foundation for all future aspirations to succeed.”

Ranging in age from teenagers to seniors, volunteers enthusiastically open the doors at the Reading Room most weekdays from 2-5 p.m. One volunteer recently become an elder at the Willoughby Heights Canadian Reformed Church in Langley, and both he and the church were instrumental in establishing the Reading Room that opened last July in Burnaby.

“An elder is someone who attends to the spiritual needs of the people,” says the volunteer. “We encourage people to live faithful lives, to live in accordance to what God asks of us in the Bible, and we try to help them along the way.”

His commitment to being an elder involves visiting church members and engaging them in conversation about their lives and Christianity. He also reaches out to the community to offer support where he feels it’s needed. This experience no doubt aids him in the volunteer role at the Reading Room, where volunteers love to talk with guests over coffee.

One volunteer has noticed that at times members of his congregation feel lost, searching for purpose and dwelling on the meaninglessness of life.

“We want to offer another perspective,” he says. “People struggle through different things in life at different stages. We encourage them to live their lives more meaningfully and purposefully, and show them how they can find this purpose.”

The Willoughby Heights Canadian Reformed Church, along with several Canadian Reformed Churches in Aldergrove and Chilliwack, and the United Reformed Church in New Westminster, worked together to establish the Reading Roomin July of 2015.

Recognizing the need in the Burnaby area, the Reading Room provides a place where people—both Christian and non-Christian—can explore the faith, ask questions, have discussions with volunteers, and read books and other literature on Christianity.

Often misdiagnosed and underreported, OSA is a breathing disorder that occurs when there is a blockage at the back of the throat, impeding on a person’s ability to breath. While many may misdiagnose OSA as fatigue or snoring, it can have severe health consequences, resulting in heart disease, depression, type II diabetes, and high blood pressure.

Restful sleep is a necessary aspect of a healthy lifestyle. It is imperative for many essential bodily functions, including memory, cognition, and a strong immune system. Prolonged sleep deprivation has also been linked to eye disease, weight loss, and even death; while it is unclear how long people can survive without sleep, studies show that hallucinations begin within 11 days and people have died within 32 days.

The consequences of prolonged sleep deprivation can be dangerous for you and those around you. Whether you have trouble sleeping because you watch TV late at night, or because you suffer from untreated OSA, the Registered Nurses and Respiratory Therapists at CanSleep Services can help.

The Elizabeth Fry Society of Greater Vancouver’s (EFry) mission is to help reduce the odds.

“More than 90 per cent of women’s crimes are driven by poverty,” says Shawn Bayes, executive director of EFry. “EFry began in 1939 to support women in prison and we still do that. Now, we also work to address the factors that put women at risk of breaking the law.”

Lack of employment is a key reason women reoffend. Four years ago, EFry began a social enterprise operated from Burnaby, Asphalt Gals, which provides site clean-up services to the busy roofing industry. EFry recruits women before release, so they know they will have an income to rely on.

“We provide whatever a woman needs to work with us: boots, equipment, training, sometimes even food in the beginning. We set women up for success and they do themselves proud,” says Bayes. Asphalt Gals consistently receives rave reviews and repeat business from its customers.

As the majority of female inmates are single mothers, supporting children with a parent in prison was a natural fit for EFry. In 2001, it launched JustKids, Canada’s first such initiative.

“Without specialized supports, more than half of kids with incarcerated parents end up in prison themselves,” says Bayes. “We can help change that.” Programs include spring break and summer camps, Saturday clubs, a literacy program and holiday support. Every JustKids activity is made possible solely thanks to donations.

In all, EFry offers nearly two dozen programs and services to help women and youth, at risk, involved in or affected by the justice system, including drop-in centres, shelters, supportive recovery programs, transitional housing, parenting and child development programs.

141,burnabynow,https://www.burnabynow.com/standout/ancient-healing-secrets-of-salt-therapy-1.2240075,Ancient Healing Secrets of Salt Therapy,[],,"A halotherapy spa resort was first mentioned in records dating back to 12th century Poland. Since then, halotherapy has found its way all over the world. As an alternative medicine, many forms of salt therapy exist today, the benefits of which are well documented, including treatment of allergies, asthma or skin conditions like eczema and dermatitis.

Halotherapy remains popular in Europe; however, it’s not easily found in Canada and the US. It was especially difficult to find halotherapy services on the West Coast- that is, until Helen and Keith Tong opened their wellness centre, Pure 5 Wellness Hub, in Burnaby in January, 2016.

“There’s no place like this in Burnaby or Vancouver,” says the Tongs. “Back in the day people would sit in a salt cave and feel better just because they were breathing in the micronized salt, which cleans out the airways.”

Today, halotherapy chambers come in several different forms: natural formations of salt caves (known as speloetherapy), rooms made from salt blocks and equipped with air-filtering systems, or rooms with a coating of salt on the walls.

With speleotherapy, one takes advantage of the natural climate in salt caves, some of which are 300-million years old. But speleotherapy may be harder to recreate and enjoy as it depends on natural formations.

Popular halotherapy spas in Belarus and Slovakia provide lounge chairs for clients to use while the aerosol works its way through the air, into the lungs. Conducted movement and breathing sessions help the aerosol make its way to the affected regions of the respiratory system.

Most will breathe easier after a salt halotherapy session, and several studies have shown that it boosts your immune system. It’s not uncommon for asthmatics to use their inhalers less frequently after halptherapy and for sufferers of seasonal allergies to see their symptoms significantly decreased.

Salt therapy is also used for irrigation and cleaning of human cavities. Orally, it may be best remembered for helping heal ones throat from the Strep virus: gargling with salt water. Saline irrigation and lavage is used for some respiratory system, colonic, or gynecological treatments.

That’s because the facility offers a wide range of camps which cater to just about whatever you like, from skating up a storm, kicking a soccer ball, or developing a great first serve.

“We’ve got something for everyone,” said Jessica Ferguson, program managerat 8 Rinks, where camps run from July 2 to August 30.

Just in the ice hockey category alone, there are so many choices. Try power skating, improve your skills, learn to skate shoot and score, and even a high-performance camp, all under the watchful eyes of experienced and knowledgeable coaches.

“The skills they learn in the hockey camps will be essential to them for hockey in the fall,” said Ferguson, adding that while many of the young players come from around the Lower Mainland, some travel from much further - the U.S., Korea and even China - to hit the ice.

The hockey programs are open to youngsters aged four to 14-years-old, while the Multisports program runs for four to 12-years-old.

And as its name suggests, the Multisport program features an array of fun activities, from extreme ball sports, whacky water week, swimming and tennis.

The tennis program uses the courts adjacent to Bill Copeland Arena, the soccer camp is held in the indoor arena inside the 8 Rinks facility, and the nearby pool is the place to cool off and enjoy a swim.

“All of the activities centre around a variety of sports, which is nice for the kids to do something new each time. Even some of the hockey kids take part to change things up a little bit for them.”

“We really pride ourselves on providing the best experience for the kids.”

The full-day camps start at 8:15 a.m. and end at 4 p.m., while the half-day camps run from 9 a.m. to noon and then 12:45 p.m. to 4 p.m.

Extended care is also available from 4 p.m., with pick-up at 6 p.m.

With his eye for detail and an understanding of all things financial, settling on real estate transactions and property conveyance as a preferred area of practice seemed a natural choice.

“Real estate makes up approximately 45 percent of my law practice,” Mr. Oduoza explains. “When it comes to financing and mortgages, I understand the needs of both the borrower, my client, and the lender, the financial institution.”

Mr. Oduoza’s other areas of expertise are assisting small business entrepreneurs set up and run their Enterprises, Family Law, and Wills and Estate Planning.

Initially used to heal broken legs in racehorses, sports doctors soon caught on to PEMF, and after a period of experimentation with willing athletes, the FDA approved the use of PEMF with a prescription. Recent developments have seen both Health Canada and the FDA approve these devices for wider use.

“Our cells have a millivolt current that is disrupted when we get sick,” says Helen Tong, co-owner and manager of Pure 5 Wellness Hub. “This PEMF device energizes and recharges the cells so they start talking to each other, allowing the body to heal itself faster.”

Magnetic bracelets and magnetic therapy differ from PEMF in that research and studies have moved PEMF from being considered an alternative medicine to being viewed as a commonly accepted practice. Research conducted in 1974 demonstrated that PEMF accelerates bone repair, even though it was unclear at the time exactly how this occurred. Over forty years later, research related to the device and its potential uses is still being conducted today.

“I broke my fifth metatarsal in December,” says Keith Tong, co-owner and manager with wife Helen. “Using the PEMF device healed it much, much faster. The primary use of our device is to increase blood circulation, thereby relieving aches and pains.”

PEMF therapy has also been found to help those who suffer from depression but don’t respond to antidepressants. This was first discovered when the mood of bipolar patients improved after a magnetic resonance spectrogram. The effects of PEMF show behavioral effects that are consistent with antidepressants.

Electromagnetic field therapy is still in its infancy, but Health Canada has approved PEMF as a Class 2 medical device, sharing the same legality as contact lenses.

145,burnabynow,https://www.burnabynow.com/standout/4-important-tips-for-palliative-and-hospice-care-1.2344522,4 important tips for palliative and hospice care,[],,"Liina McNeil of the Burnaby Hospice Society has witnessed firsthand the strain the end-of-life journey can have on individuals, families and caregivers. So whenever the counsellor sees anyone in her community struggling with it, she is compelled to do what she can to help them through the process.

“We provide a free weekly workshop series about the end-of-life journey,” says McNeil, a long-time counsellor. “The initiative is based on giving out valuable information for all parties involved in the process— whether they are people living with life-limiting illness, people who are grieving the loss of a loved one, or those who just want to be proactive—in order to maximize self-management and care.”

article continues below

Here are four essentials takeaways from the workshop series for anyone involved in a hospice or palliative care situation:

1. Fatigue– Tiredness is the most common symptom of the end-of-life process, but McNeil says it can be dealt with proactively. “Fatigue can be sparked by psychological and mental changes but it also can just be a symptom of taking on too many things at the same time. It’s important to understand what fatigue looks and feels like at this particular stage of life, even before it sets in. That way it can be recognized and dealt with.”

2. Exercise – Exercise still plays a part in palliative care, says McNeil. It’s just different. “We know we feel better after exercise,” she points out. “In general, exercise builds up hormone production in your system and makes you feel happier as a result. For someone who has cancer, however, first thing in the morning they may not have energy to exercise—that energy may come throughout the day. It’s important to listen to your body’s rhythm. Staying active is important—even if it doesn’t look or feel the same as it used to.”

3. Nutrition – For an individual with a life-limiting illness, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting are all commons symptoms that can dramatically impact one’s eating habits. “If food isn’t tasting or feeling the same as it used to, then it’s important to figure out what can help,” says McNeil. “Start by exploring the taste of food and whether there’s a schedule of eating that works better for them. Sometimes small changes can make a big difference.”

4. Routine – “Planning activities when you have the most energy is essential,” says McNeil. “The key is not holding onto the past. If going to the gym for half an hour was a good workout before but now walking up a flight of stairs gets your winded, you need to adjust. It’s important to understand our bodies and their capabilities as they inevitably change.”

“Prevention is key,” he says. “We can prevent little problems from becoming big, expensive, painful problems.”

With over 20 years’ experience as a dentist, Dr. Katz believes that with regular visits, he and his dental hygienists can identify any issues early and recommend a course of action for home dental care.

“We’re very approachable here,” he says, “and we believe in discussing treatment options thoroughly and making sure the patient is comfortable with any course of treatment. But home dental care is key to preventing things like cavities or gum disease.”

Conveniently located for both Burnaby and New Westminster residents, Dr. Katz’s practice features state of the art equipment with friendly, well-trained staff. For the more anxious patient, sedation is available.

“We can certainly offer sedation to patients who are nervous or anxious to help them relax.” Dr. Katz explains. “We usually use a mild sedation that you inhale. The benefit is that once the mask is removed from your face, the gas wears off quickly. It’s the only form of sedation where you can drive yourself home after the procedure.”

Preventing the loss of his patients’ teeth is a key area of Dr. Katz’s practice, but it’s good to know that if a tooth needs to come out, that these days there are a number of good options to replace lost teeth, most notably of which are dental implants.

Your funeral provider is an important part of that support system.

Funeral providers have specially trained staff who know how to guide the bereaved through a difficult process, and some, such as those in the Dignity Memorial® network, offer a range of services to make things easier, according to Andrew Knapman, Location Manager at Forest Lawn Funeral Home in Burnaby.

article continues below

While people initially think they won’t need the extra help, many find it useful over time, he says.

“They’re not really thinking about the long-term effects of grief—that it’s going to take them many months and years to come to grips with the loss,” he explains.

According to Andrew, here are 3 uniquely helpful services to look for:

1. Bereavement travel. Arranging travel to attend a funeral can add stress at a difficult time. The travel program through Dignity Memorial® connects families with bereavement travel specialists at Carlson Wagonlit Travel, who can plan every aspect of travel and know about special bereavement rates and other deals that can help with the cost. They look for the best rates for the family.

2. 24-hour compassion line. The helpline, run by Charles Nechtem and Associates Inc., is staffed by professionals with advanced degrees who are trained in grief counseling. Family members can call the line during the year following the loss of their loved one. While some people don’t expect to need the service, it comes in handy, Knapman says, particularly for people who find it hard to burden others with their troubles, or those who can’t sleep and need someone to talk to late at night.

3. Grief management library. People process grief slowly, and require help at different stages and in different forms. The Dignity Memorial® Guidance Series offers books, pamphlets and DVDs that can help you deal with your grief. The libraries are on site at funeral homes such as Forest Lawn.

Whatever stage of grief you’re experiencing, the right people and resources can make the process much easier to bear. A good funeral provider offers help to those left behind.

Nicole Renwick, Executive Director of the Memorial Society of British Columbia, uses the analogy of the pilgrims crossing America to describe a green burial.

article continues below

""Imagine the pilgrims making their way across America,"" she says. ""When someone died, they simply wrapped the person in a blanket and buried them. There was no embalming fluid, no burial liner, zero affect on the environment. The body was left to decompose in the ground.""

With today's interest in the environment, the green burial is enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Nicole outlines four things you should know about a green burial:

1. It's completely natural

A green burial is a process that allows for the natural decomposition of human remains without the inclusion of chemicals.

""As a minimum,"" Nicole explains, ""for a burial to be considered green, the Memorial Society of B.C. requirements include a biodegradable coffin, no embalming, and no grave liner.""

Preferably, there should be plants or shrubs planted on the grave. The highest form of a green burial would include interment in a natural setting.

2. Green burials are gaining in popularity

""It's a very popular option,"" says Nicole. ""With today's interest in conserving the environment, people are thinking more and more about avoiding the use of chemicals and chemical liners in their burial.""

3. There are various levels of ""greenness""

""At the Memorial Society of B.C.,"" explains Nicole, ""we recognize that people have different interpretations of what constitutes a ""green"" burial. We're actively working throughout British Columbia to ensure that all levels of green burials are available around the province.""

4. Recyclable plots

A major benefit of a green burial in this time of land scarcity on the Lower Mainland is the fact that the plot is reusable.

""With a green burial,"" Nicole explains, ""you don't purchase the plot. You lease a small piece of land. In 25 years, that plot can be reused for another burial because your remains have decomposed into the earth as part of the natural life cycle of the planet.""

The Memorial Society of British Columbia is a non-profit, member-based, volunteer-driven organization that has been helping British Columbians with end of life planning decisions for more than 60 years. For a nominal one-time membership fee, the Society will record your wishes for the disposal of your remains as well as assist your loved ones secure a discount on funeral services with an approved funeral homes throughout the province.

From making decisions about floral arrangements and catering, to choosing speakers and location, planning out your own funeral or the funeral of a loved one can be an overwhelming experience that often occurs during the most difficult of times.

However, those at Forest Lawn Funeral Home actually say that pre-arranging and pre-paying for your funeral is more positive than you may think. Andrew Knapman, the manager at Forest Lawn Funeral Home, says that it is not just money and time that you are saving.

article continues below

“When you pre-arrange your own funeral, you’re making your wishes known so that your family isn’t trying to guess what you would have wanted afterwards,” Knapman said. “A lot of the times people don’t want to have that conversation with their loved ones, but if they’ve pre-arranged it, people can speak with the advisor and talk about the types of things they would like at their funeral service.” This way, he said, families will not have to make those decisions later on.

In fact, pre-paying for your funeral can also be a forthright and conscientious aspect of pre-arranging your funeral. As funeral costs in the Lower Mainland continue to increase each year, paying increasing prices for funeral costs should be the last of your worries. That is why at Forest Lawn Funeral Home, you can lock in the price of your pre-arranged funeral at a cost that fits within your budget and pay it over time. “By the time someone has passed away,” Knapman explained, “it is all paid for and if the fees have gone up in the meantime, the family will not have to pay extra.”

From pre-planning to after the funeral service, Forest Lawn Funeral Home is by the side of the families, offering support and empathy every step of the way. As a part of Dignity Memorial, the largest provider of funeral, cremation and cemetery services, Forest Lawn Funeral Home is one of the names that families turn to for compassionate and professional final arrangements.

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

A month after the BC Junior A Lacrosse League was supposed to begin playing, the league officially cancelled its 2020 season.

The Minto Cup, along with all other minor and senior national championships, has also been cancelled by the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

In a release, BCJALL president Karl Christiansen said ongoing restrictions in British Columbia limiting the size of public gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic to no more than 50 people made it impossible for games to be played.

“We had hope we might be able to compete this year,” he said. “But it became evident we wouldn’t be able to have a normal season.”

Christiansen said alternative schedules were considered, but public health directives were insurmountable.

CLA president Shawn Williams said health and safety, travel concerns and venue closures were the main considerations in its decision to cancel all 2020 national championships from the Mann Cup senior men’s title to the U12 finals, as well as the U19 women’s field lacrosse championships.

“We recognize that national championships are important to lacrosse players of all ages,” he said, adding all hosts for 2020 events will be charged with staging their championships in 2021. That means the Minto and Mann Cups will both be played in Ontario.

The first-ever Isolympic Games wrapped up this week with 16 ultimate teams from across the province taking part in a fun competition that was completed through video submissions from students at home.

article continues below

The competition was the brainchild of Danie Proby and Ari Nitikman, an ultimate power couple from Burnaby who co-founded Elevate Ultimate, a company that specializes in running training programs for the popular disc sport.

Proby, pushed on by the boredom of physical distancing and missing her regular contact with ultimate players, put out a call on Elevate’s Instagram page looking for high school teams interested in taking part in a 16-team, single elimination tournament.

“Within an hour, we had all 16 spots filled,” said Proby, who was a high school teacher in Burnaby before co-founding the training company. “They were all really excited.”

Teams from across the province signed up, including Windsor, Argyle and Sutherland from the North Shore. The first round consisted of a disc-spinning challenge, with one player from each team nominated to spin a disc on their fingers (like a basketball) for as long as they could without dropping or stopping. Some entrants were able to keep their discs spinning for more than 10 minutes, which taught the event hosts a valuable lesson: set a one-minute time limit for future challenges. The quarterfinals involved a “same hand throw and catch behind the back” challenge, and the semifinals were a “disc knock” challenge, an event described by the organizers as “you have to see it to understand.”

Through each round Proby and Nitikman recorded intros and analysis for the challenges, with Proby editing it all together with the team submissions into very cute and charming videos that Elevate shared on Instagram and YouTube.

The hosts had fun with it, using a winter glove taped to a stick for a microphone and even putting on formal wear for the big final.

“We thought we should get dressed up for the occasion,” said Proby. “It was pretty fun to put it together. Definitely time consuming, but it was worth it.”

The championship match, a trick shot competition, saw Sutherland – a surprise entry that was knocked out in the first round but snuck back in as an emergency replacement team in the quarterfinals – taking on Burnaby’s Moscrop Secondary.

Moscrop’s entrant pulled off a ridiculous over-the-house hammer throw into a garbage can, while Sutherland’s finalist set up an intricate mousetrap-like maze throughout her house that was set into motion by a blindfolded disc throw though a row of hoops.

“I had no idea anyone would be that committed to it,” said Proby. “When she did the hammer over the house. ... I don’t know how she does it. It was so incredible. [And] Sutherland’s was really intricate. They must have spent an entire day setting up that course.”

Sutherland was represented in the final by Grade 12 student Hannah Smith, who teamed up with her sister Georgia, a Grade 10 player on the team, to pull off the trick. It did take them the better part of a day to set it up, execute the shot and get it on film, said Hannah. Their submission also involved more than a dozen teammates, friends and family members cheering them on in video chats, a heartwarming show of team spirit in these physically distant times.

“It was a fun way to spend my time and just kind of get some time with my sister, but then also we had kind of our whole team involved,” said Hannah, who said the exercise was a welcome reminder of the good times the team has when they are all on the field together. “Usually we have at least, like, three practices a week and games and stuff. So being able to see each other virtually and have this experience … it was a way to kind of feel the team spirit again, which is not always easy to do virtually.”

So who won the final? You’ll have to watch the video to find out. Trust me – it’s worth your time, if only for the gentle shade each school throws at the other.

Proby has heard back from the participating teams that they had a blast reconnecting during the Isolympic Games.

“It was really creative, a really good idea,” said Argyle co-captain Mattias Campos, a Grade 12 student who spiced up the disc-spinning challenge by donning some futuristic shades. “We’re all not doing anything, we’re all just sitting at home not able to actually go and play ultimate, so it was a good thing to do, a way to pass the time. … It was nice because it kind of reawakened the competitive spirit that we kind of lost since the season kind of got postponed or possibly even cancelled. It was a good way to bring us back together as a team.”

The hosts set up a group chat for the first round and were touched to see that all the schools stayed active throughout the event regardless of whether or not their team was still alive.

“They still wanted to be involved,” said Proby. “It was adorable. They were all making friends. … One team said this was making isolation bearable, which was nice to hear. And then other people were saying that it was really fun and entertaining to watch, a nice break from reality.”

It was a welcome break from reality for the organizers as well.

“I love working with youth, and so being away from coaching has been really hard,” said Proby. ""We’re normally coaching from morning till night, and thinking about coaching, and it’s been hard on our business too. So this was a fun way to interact with young people again – their energy is unmatched by anything else.”

If you missed out on the first Isolympic Games (click here to see all the videos), don’t fret – Proby and Nitikman vowed to keep holding competitions as long as the isolation chambers are active in B.C.

Both Argyle and Sutherland have already thrown their discs into the ring for Round 2.

“We’re just really thankful and grateful that Elevate held the Isolation Olympics, because I thought it's just such a creative idea and a great way just to keep everyone involved in the spirit of ultimate,” said Smith. “They made it just like a super fun way to kind of keep in the sport and also be distracted and just enjoy the time, make the best of our time as we are isolating from everybody.”",[]

A month ago, the two École Alpha Secondary students were in the same dugout, gleaning lessons and experiences as part of the Canadian national junior (under-18) spring training team in Florida, playing games against the likes of the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies.

“It’s nerve-wracking every time I do it. This is my third year I’ve (been to a junior national camp), and every time I step on the mound or in the clubhouse it gives me the shakes,” said the six-foot-four Millas. “I know I’ll be fine out there if I work at it and are 100% focused.”

The setting – the national program shared the same diamond and fields as the Blue Jays in Dunedin, Florida – was picture-perfect for painting corners and throwing hard heat from the mound. Mingling with major leaguers and watching how they approach the game is something that can’t be beat, they said.

“As soon as you get off the bus and walk into the clubhouse – it’s only spring training, but still, it’s a real eye-opener, especially the first time. It didn’t get old to me. It’s surreal to see,” said Siniscalchi, 16.

“It really never gets old. We were shagging BP (batting practice) and I remember sitting there and talking with (Toronto pitcher) Ryan Borowski. It was like, we’re just so lucky to have the opportunity, to have them so easy to talk to and so willing to talk to.”

Siniscalchi, a right-hander, made his debut with the Blaze last year and fanned 57 batters over 42.1 innings for a 2.15 ERA. He recorded a 4-1 record and racked up a pair of saves while splitting time as a starter and reliever.

Seventeen-year-old Millas is considered one of Canada’s top under-18 pitchers, and has been interviewed by Major League teams as they prepared for the 2020 June draft. The right-hander, who went 6-1 with a 1.34 earned run average over eight starts last season as a second-year veteran of the B.C. Premier Baseball League’s Langley Blaze, has committed with Louisiana State for this fall.

For MLB scouts, the challenge of drafting is all in the projection – what will a 17-year-old who can touch 93, 94 miles per hour be like in five years’ time? The player has learned that every new challenge is a growth opportunity.

“My first time (with the junior national program), you’re the best player on your team like everyone else,” recalled Millas. “I was one of the youngest guys, in Grade 10, and it was a whole new environment for me. I was like the quieter guy, a rookie. We had a few (MLB) first round draft picks on the team, so they seemed scary and I didn’t want to mess around with them. I was a scared little kid trying to mind my own business.”

While they were playing the Blue Jays on March 12, news came down that the camp – and all of North American professional sports – would come to an early end due to COVID-19.

“It was heartbreaking here, to have all of baseball cancelled. It was not a good time, we were starting up and getting excited for the season,” Millas said of the Blaze. “We can’t even practise with the team. Thank God I have an older brother (Nicholas) who played baseball at New Mexico junior college, so we go out to the local park two blocks out and play long toss and (he) catches some flat ground for me.”

The camp was to help the coaches – whose ranks include former MLB players Jeff Francis, Scott Mathieson and Peter Orr – decide the 20-player roster for the fall junior world qualifier tournament in Mexico.

For Siniscalchi, who threw a no-hitter against defending champ Whalley in the 2016 Canadian national final to catapult Hastings Little League to the World Series, standing on the pitching mound is a moment to revel in.

“When you get to that level everyone can throw the ball, everyone has some sort of talent,” said Siniscalchi, whose fastball has been clocked at 91 mph. “I think what separates me is my composure; ever since I was young it’s always been a strength of mine. Sometimes there are thousands of people watching, sometimes only a hundred, but when (the scouts) have that radar gun sticking at you and their notepads out – for some people it isn’t easy, but I really enjoy those moments.”

In his third season as part of the national junior program, Millas said those high-pressure situations are part of pursuing the MLB dream. Last summer, as the lone Canadian invited to the Under Armour All-American Game in Chicago, he received a prime taste of what so many are chasing.

“It was just a crazy experience, being able to step onto Wrigley Field and play with 30 of the best young players in the world,” he recalled. “It was just incredible. I was the only Canadian and only 14 (Canadians) have ever attended, and I’m pretty proud to say I was one.”

His turn on the legendary diamond saw him take to the mound and throw a clean slate – one inning, three outs on six pitches.

All though time seems frozen and in lockdown, the end of isolation and social distancing will come. Then the games will resume, and Millas and Siniscalchi, like their teammates, will get back on the diamond.

The pair is hopeful that they will be among the 20 named to compete at the world junior qualifiers and help Canada advance to the next world championships, scheduled for next summer in Florida.

“Putting on the Canadian jersey is always something cool. I take a lot of pride in that and it’s definitely a confidence booster,” said Siniscalchi.",[]

The fact that the program was ranked among the top-10 in the B.C. School Sports Girls Basketball Association’s 2020-21 pre-season poll is a tip-of-the-hat for a youthful lineup with a lot to prove.

article continues below

For assistant coach Peter VanDenHoogen, the potential is there for the squad to make next year’s provincial derby – but a lot of things need to come together before the season starts next December.

“I think it’s humbling for sure but I also think its inspiring for the girls to see that we’ve cracked the top-10 in the province, a very rich basketball playing province,” remarked VanDenHoogen, who works alongside head coach Chris Ducharme. “(Last season) was definitely a growth year. We had three Grade 8s who played up sometimes with us. We have a very young team.”

Youth and talent combined could be the perfect recipe for a program that’s not tasted any provincial action since the Gen-Y era.

Led by Grade 9 guard Jade Huynh and Grade 11 forward Priya Dhaliwal, the Wildcats pushed the envelope and dominated during the regular season last winter, going undefeated until the playoff final when Burnaby South captured the title. In the inaugural Fraser North playdowns – pitting the best from the Burnaby-New West league and the Coquitlam district – it was the Rebels once again who did the damage, ending Burnaby Central’s season in a 65-54 loss in the quarter-finals.

“That was a heartbreaker for us. … Burnaby South beat us (in the league final); then they beat us in the Fraser North tournament. Our adversity was that we rolled along easily to start the year; then when we saw South again they put a pounding on us,” said VanDenHoogen.

Already with two years of senior ball under their belts, Huynh and Dhaliwal demonstrated some impressive skills. Huynh averaged 25 points per game last season, while Dhaliwal also displayed a consistent shooting touch.

“Jade is a very quiet leader, but she’s the point guard. If she wants to continue to develop, she needs to be a voice from the back court,” he noted. “(Dhaliwal) is a gifted athlete and a coach’s dream to coach, but she doesn’t play physically. When she practises with us, she’s physical. It just doesn’t translate to the games.”

The team also benefited from the contributions of the Grade 8 trio of Ankita Chopra, Vobia Kalome and Jayla Huynh, who were part of a perfect season with the bantam squad, coached by the eldest Huynh sister, 2019 grad Jalynne.

VanDenHoogen said the three have an opportunity to make the big jump, but it will all depend upon if they’re ready to handle the rigours of the more physical, grittier senior circuit.

“The problem with some of the younger kids is that they’re not strong enough physically to play the whole year at senior, so you have to decide which level they’ll play at,” he said.

And while the Wildcats have all the elements to continue the upward trajectory, the first step is always thriving at the league level. Burnaby South, which finished 10th at the provincials after placing third in the Fraser North, will try to better that achievement, while teams from New West and Burnaby Mountain, among others, will also be in the mix.

Then there’s the Fraser North challenge, which replaced the former Lower Mainland route to the B.C.s. The crowd of formidable rivals from Coquitlam include fellow ranked Terry Fox (No. 4), Riverside (No. 5) and Heritage Woods (No. 9).

“When the World Cup (of soccer) comes out there is always a Group of Death. We’re in the Group of Death (Fraser North) for girls’ basketball. ... There were legitimately three of the top-5 teams in the province arguably (last year), so the provincials are a tough slog in Fraser North.”

Still, at this stage, with no teams permitted to play or practise due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so much remains up in the air. Just knowing others see the squad’s potential is a nice feeling, VanDenHoogen said.

“It’s new territory for us and we’ve never swam in deep waters before. So I don’t know what we’ll do, to be honest. I was surprised (to be ranked), but talent-wise I think we can be a top-10 team.”",[]

Like so many others, the Burnaby woman has witnessed the impact of COVID-19 and seen her own Olympic dream derailed – temporarily – as the sports world has been frozen by the worldwide pandemic.

The goal of representing her mom’s homeland the Philippines at the Tokyo Olympics is still motivating the track sprinter.

“Honestly, after the NCAA season got cancelled, it was probably in my best interest to have (the Olympics) postponed. I was going to be missing crucial races, hitting the standard time. I had big goals for this season, so once it got cancelled it was like the motivation went down a little bit,” Corrales Nelson said.

Her disappointment was put in perspective with the sight of how everyone took a hit at her San Francisco Bay area campus, located north of Oakland, where sports and academic hopes were piled under the reality of a deadly pandemic, which has spared no one.

“There was panic when (California) went on lockdown; people in the grocery stores mass-buying things,” the Burnaby native said. “It’s cooled down quite a bit but there was the initial hit when the news came out of impending lockdown (on March 13 that) made people get pretty nervous. … I know there’s panic amongst restaurant owners, local business owners trying to keep afloat.”

A year ago, the St. Thomas More Collegiate alum had turned around an average outdoor season with a really strong finish, twice carving out new personal best times in her 100- and 200-metre events en route to the NCAA national track and field championships.

Her times at last May’s West Regionals – 11.41 seconds in the 100m, and 23.18 in the 200m – continued a run that saw her slice seconds off her previous best, set a month earlier. It also catapulted her to the NCAA championships in Texas, where she placed 18th in the 200m with a finish time of 23.24.

“I think the beginning of my outdoor season was going pretty well, but I wasn’t hitting the regional standard. I was getting pretty nervous, but towards early April I started to buckle down in training and started to PR (personal record) in a couple of meets. … So making nationals was a huge, huge accomplishment for me and it was super surprising. I didn’t think I’d run that fast but it all worked out. I made nationals and it kind of opened my eyes to the potential I had to running consistent 22s in the next year and making the dream come true.”

Her 200m time also shattered a 33-year-old Philippine record, and fanned the flame to continue pursuing that Olympic path.

The third-year student-athlete was also named to the honourable All-American list.

What was a chance to cement that momentum has now been put in isolation, but didn’t dampen the desire for the studious sprinter.

“We were all pretty excited (about the 2020 season). The nationals were in all our minds, a top-eight and getting an Olympic standard was definitely going to happen for sure. … Definitely just from last season I had in my mind that I could compete with the best of the best, (and) that helped me throughout the season. There’s always next year to get it going again.”

Just 21, Corrales Nelson feels getting to the 22.80-seconds Olympic standard is within her stride – once athletics, and the world, is allowed to resume something normal. When that is remains up in the air, with the U.S. now feeling the brunt of the pandemic.

In the meantime, Corrales Nelson keeps connected to her family and younger sister, Shiloh, who is in her first year as a student-athlete at the University of California-Riverside.

“It sucks but it helps to have school still going, doing homework,” she said. “I try to go on a run, go on a trail run and keep a routine. I want to be busy so that my mind doesn’t go super crazy being alone here. I have a lot of school work so there’s a lot to do.”

Putting her running skills to the test will have to wait. But the Olympic dream of representing the Philippines continues to be powerful inspiration.",[]

To no surprise, the current champions sit atop the list, with a deep returning roster fit to make it three championships in four years.

“It’s nice to receive the recognition, for all the work the kids put in and what the coaches are doing, but at the end of the day you want the recognition in March (at the championship),” remarked Burnaby South head coach Mike Bell.

“We don’t take anything for granted, because the games have to be played out.”

The reigning Rebels, who defeated the Kelowna Owls 70-58 just four weeks ago in the title game at the Langley Events Centre, will be losing a trio of starters in Emir Krupic, Matthew Pineda and Sasha Vujisic.

The six-foot-10 Vujisic was a first team all-star, while Krupic was the championship final’s Quinn Keast Foundation Player of the Game.

All three were instrumental contributors, but they were also unavailable during the first month of last season, due to injuries and a B.C. School Sports suspension. So in a way, next season’s Burnaby South lineup has already been road tested.

“We played virtually all of December without Matthew, Sasha or Emir,” said Bell. “We only lost one game, by one point to Kelowna (in the Tsumura Invitational final on Dec. 6) during that time. For all intense purposes, that’s mostly what our team will be.”

During the first six weeks of the season, the Rebels were 15-1, with Pineda and Vuljisic sidelined with injuries. Krupic completed his one-year suspension – for having played an allotted number of games with a Seattle prep program the year previous – after the calendar changed to 2020.

The core of the championship team will start with guards Justin Sunga and Jareb Pineda, who demonstrated worldly leadership abilities while setting the on-court tone. Sunga, in his second senior season as a Grade 11, continued to dominate on both sides of the ball against the best competition in the province.

“Justin was very capable at doing it all. He set the tone on defence, and leading our attack. (Being) defensively strong is what we preach and what we expect.”

Sunga averaged 15.5 points per game at the provincials, while chalking up a lot of steals, assists and rebounds.

Pineda, meanwhile, made the jump to the senior level after earning the 2019 B.C. junior championship MVP award a year ago, and was pressed into shadowing some of the most dynamic players in the province.

“(Pineda) probably didn’t get enough recognition from others that he deserved,” said Bell. “He handled every other teams top players during the playoffs and provincials and contained them. (Grade 10 Jimmy Zaborniak) stepped up and was asked to sub-in for (Pineda) and did a good job, too.”

Karan Aujla, at six-foot-seven, continued to develop as a primary post, stepping out of Vujisic’s shadow to be a consistent contributor on boards and scoring.

Players who held supporting roles this season, like Anthony Palomino-Acevedo, Conlin Duong and Eric Li, will be tasked with bigger opportunities for the coming season.

Adding to the depth of the team will be a number of junior grads, led by standout guard Zach Chan. The jr. Rebels placed seventh in B.C., after winning it all in 2019. This year’s Grade 9 team, meanwhile, finished third at their provincials.

While the focus from outside is on the senior program, Bell notes that Burnaby South’s overall strength is depth at all levels, and the connectivity that all the teams share.

“We’re going to have tonnes of guards. We’ll still play a lot of the stuff we did, but we just won’t have two bigs like we did this year,” the coach noted. “We’ll be undersized and have to find a way to win by out-working the other teams.

“The rankings are nice but we know every team is going to come at us.”",[]

Scheduled to begin May 21, with New Westminster hosting Maple Ridge, while the Burnaby Lakers were to visit Victoria on May 22, the start date is now in limbo due to the COVID-19 health pandemic.

League governors decided to postpone the start, and officials with both the WLA and Major Series Lacrosse of Ontario are working together with an aim of having a Mann Cup championship series between the two leagues in September, hosted by Ontario.

“Our intention is to play a full season but we have alternately drafted a few proposals that give us options should the situation not permit (a regular length schedule),” WLA commissioner Paul Dal Monte said in an interview with the NOW on Tuesday. “We have drafted two alternative schedules, with playoff options, and aligned in lock-step with the MSL.”

When they receive the all-clear from health officials to open shuttered community facilities and permit large public gatherings, municipal schedulers will be inundated with requests for floor time from the minor sports and recreation sports user groups, as well. That would also require some coordinating on a local standpoint, Dal Monte said.

The WLA governors are slated to meet again on April 11 to review their options. Dal Monte said the focus is on preparing for a possible spring startup that could facilitate a condensed schedule and playoffs and a September Mann Cup tournament.

Burnaby Lakers general manager Kevin Hill said as much as everyone is itching to get going, public safety trumps all.

“It’s a tough decision, but as much as everyone wants to get a season going, there are far more important things than lacrosse at stake,” said Hill. “We have to think about our players, our fans, and our support staff.”

The WLA regular season usually sees teams play each other three times over an 18-game schedule, for a total of 63 games. If the league reduced its schedule to a home-and-home series between each team, it would result in a 12-game schedule per team, for 42 league games.

“The end goal is to have a Mann Cup, and what form the season and playoffs take is part of the contingency plan,” added Hill.

With Ontario slated to host the Mann Cup championship and a number of the competitive teams there share an arena with an Ontario Hockey League club, postponing the national series would be a challenge.

“In arenas where a number of Ontario teams play junior hockey takes precedent, like in Peterborough,” noted Dal Monte. “But the Mann Cup is the Mann Cup, so we’ll have to see.”

The Ontario league has not announced a change in schedule as of Tuesday, but released a statement that extends the ban on all in-person lacrosse activities to May 15, pending further provincial directives.

The WLA schedule was originally slated to go until July 31, with league playoffs going on during August.

A defenceman with the University of B.C. Thunderbirds’ men’s hockey team, Carvalho and Co. were closing in a major accomplishment when COVID-19 put a halt to everything.

While UBC saw its path to competing in their first David Johnston University Cup USport national championship since 1977 cancelled before the opening faceoff, all the groundwork, toil and achievements that got them to that point will be something that they can reflect on for decades to come.

The T-birds, who qualified as the No. 2 team from the Canada West Conference, were in Halifax on March 12 when the tournament was cancelled due to efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19.

“It was definitely not how we envisioned things going. The boys were pretty pumped to be (in Halifax), and to have that happen was definitely not what we saw coming,” said Carvalho, 24. “At the same time we could see why it had to be done. What can you do but just roll with it and move on.”

They were slated to meet the defending national champion University of New Brunswick the next day in the quarter-final contest.

Considering the amazing race they endured to get there, it was poignant that it took a massive global epidemic to stop their march.

Underdogs every step of the way, UBC overcame an 0-3-2 start to the regular season and an eight-game winless stretch midway through the year to turn a 9-19 record into a national tournament sprint.

By surprising the University of Alberta Golden Bears 2-1 in the best-of-three Canada West semifinal, the T-birds did what no Point Grey team has managed to do for 43 years.

“That was a crazy experience for us and definitely shocked the hockey world. No one saw that coming,” noted the blueliner of the triumph in Edmonton. “I think we were (pretty loose) entering that series. The crazy thing is we almost didn’t make the playoffs. I think the thing for us was we were so use to adversity and the pressure situations. The whole last three-to-four weeks of the season was like playoff hockey, we had to win those games.”

Going 5-3 over the final month of the regular season, including a sweep of the University of Manitoba Bisons in Vancouver, got them over the playoff bar and into fifth place. That pitted them against Mount Royal Cougars in the quarter-finals.

With all games played in Calgary, Vancouver’s team grabbed the opener 4-2, dropped the second contest 5-3, then needed overtime to upset the Cougars 5-4 in the deciding game. Carvalho contributed two assists in Game 3, which saw the T-birds build a 4-1 lead only to witness Mount Royal rally to tie it.

Having posted a modest two goals and four assists over the regular season, the offensive contribution in the must-win playoffs was a nice bonus.

“(Mt. Royal) came back to tie it with one second left. Going into the dressing room we regrouped for overtime and got the win – that was just another great moment for our team,” he said.

The focus shifted north to Edmonton for the semifinals, where the heavily-favoured Golden Bears were looking to carry a league-best 23-5 record to the nationals. But with the burst of confidence from their series win over the Cougars, UBC jolted Alberta with a 3-2 overtime victory in Game 1, thanks to netminder Rylan Toth’s 51-save performance and Jerret Smith’s game winner 8:28 into the extra session.

While the Bears evened the series the next night, with a commanding 6-1 triumph, the T-birds were undeterred.

“I think we just talked and said we have to have a short term memory and move on. It’s one game, winner take all. We tried to put it in the past and focus on the game at hand. … That’s one of the things we’ve said the whole time. We had nothing to lose,” said Carvalho.

In a tight-checking affair where the Golden Bears were stymied on three powerplay chances, Tyler Sandhu’s tally 2:18 into the third proved to be the difference, guaranteeing them a spot in Halifax.

While they were swept 2-0 by the University of Saskatchewan in the CanWest final, UBC kept it close and still bore the momentum earned from two rounds of upsets. They were eager to test that resolve against New Brunswick, but instead came home wondering what could have been.

Carvalho, who played four years and 254 games for the Western Hockey League’s Prince George Cougars – and only nine playoff games -- said a good playoff run was something truly special.

“There are actually a few guys on (UBC) who haven’t had a ton of playoff success in junior,” the Burnaby Winter Club product said. “We were talking about it, how basically since our midget days we hadn’t had a big playoff run, that this was it. It was quite devastating to have it end like this.

“The whole team felt like it was a special group, a special feeling and we could have accomplished something really great.”

The English major has one year of eligibility remaining, and feels the core of the team can still apply that brief burst of momentum for next season.

“We’ve already said, we’re going to get back here next year,” he stated. “We’ve got a little taste of what it’s like. It’s huge for the program, to get that taste of what it’s like to win, to know what it takes to get there.”",[]

When it came to choosing a favourite, it was almost like rugby chose him. The pace, grittiness and grace that the game requires fit him to a ‘T.’

“I liked the physical aspect of rugby – there are lots of things you can’t do in other sports, like tackling the other players and running with the ball, it all really appealed to me,” said Duggan. “I’m strong and I’m fast and that’s the type of game I really enjoy.”

The Burnaby Central Secondary student has demonstrated the skill and desire to take it to the next level, as a member of the B.C. under-18 squad.

About six weeks ago, he was a key part of the Lower Mainland u18 squad that competed at the Western Canadian Sevens tournament in Edmonton. Duggan finished second on the team with six tries, and came away from the experience chomping at the bit for more elite action.

“It was a really fun experience. There were a couple of players I had played with before and some I’d played against,” he noted. “There were some players from the Team Canada 15s team and Canada’s Sevens team, who we played with and against. It was really interesting to see how I could play with and against some really elite players.”

B.C. would finish third overall in the tournament.

At five-foot-nine and 165-pounds, Duggan doesn’t cast a large shadow. At his fullback or right wing position, what matters most is speed. He enjoys being able to blast past tacklers and leading the charge into the opposition zone.

“I’m not a huge kid. … I’m quite fast so that definitely helps me in playing with the men,” said Duggan. “It’s not like just running straight at me, they have to catch me first. My physicality is another part of my game – just because I’m small doesn’t mean I don’t want to hit hard. I keep going and I’m determined to play good rugby.”

He only picked up the game two years ago in Grade 10 at Burnaby Central, but has garnered a lot of experience while playing with the Burnaby Lake premier reserve side. Following the lead of older brother Dylan, the younger Duggan went on to contribute to a B.C. title in u18, before joining BLRC’s premier reserves.

“That was a big step for me. Playing for the men’s team for the last two seasons has been really good for me,” he said. “It’s a big adjustment and a lot more physical. I really enjoy it and they help me a lot.”

A year ago, he spearheaded the Wildcats past rival Windsor, scoring five tries in a 36-34 win in the Lower Mainland Tier 2 final.

He was slated to play at the Vancouver Sevens Invitational earlier this month before COVID-19 forced the cancellation of all sports. Come September, Duggan is anticipating getting into the groove as a student and athlete with the Trinity Western University men’s rugby team.

Having turned his focus on the scrum game after playing soccer, wrestling, field hockey, basketball and track and field, Duggan thinks all those sports have an element of rugby in them. But there’s nothing quite the same as being able to plow into an opposing ball carrier, stripping the ball and dashing into open field.

“Lots of small things contribute to being a good rugby player, because it’s a tough sport,” said Duggan.",[]

The Lower Mainland Baseball Association, which oversees 38 teams over four leagues for 18-and older players, announced Monday that all events, games and meetings are cancelled as it encourages its members to remain safe.

Among the scrapped events was a league meeting slated for Saturday.

Lower Mainland Baseball League commissioner Dan Taylor said the public health concerns trump sports, but has mapped out some possible scenarios for when the health scare abates and regular activities can return.

“I’m hoping it isn’t too long. I’ve got about 700 guys who are itching to play,” said Taylor. “We’re not anticipating starting the season any time soon, but I’ve sort of set a date in my head for the Victoria Day (May 16 to 18) weekend, and hopefully start a short-season schedule then.”

His 38 teams, which compete in 18-plus, 30-plus and 45-plus divisions, would have to play an abbreviated schedule. In past seasons the teams play 16-game schedules, plus playoffs.

“Basically, we’re just in a great big holding pattern, like everybody else.”

Taylor notes his league is also dependent upon what the region’s minor baseball associations can do, since most of the men’s league field access relies on what is available after the kids' need are fulfilled.

“We share all the same diamonds as the minor associations,” he noted. “Most parks are allocated (municipally) for the minor organizations, because the kids come first, as it should be. Over our 26 years we’ve built up a lot of goodwill so I’m confident that we can work together.”

The league has kept the registration system open, and has advised teams that have not yet paid their registration fees to hold on until an opening day is determined.

“LMBA is instructing all teams not to practice until parks have been re-opened – per instructions from Baseball BC and all Lower Mainland municipalities. We are optimistic that we will get in some baseball time in 2020 and will keep everyone updated,” a notice posted on the LMBL website.

While the three different divisions are full with teams, one squad that has competed over the past two seasons – the B.C. Badgers, a female team composed of provincial and national-level players – won’t be returning due to scheduling conflicts.

Taylor said it was a great experience having the Badgers compete in the over-45 division, where they received steady competition in preparing for the women’s national team responsibilities. Unfortunately, because their roster includes players from Vancouver Island and right through to the Fraser Valley, it was difficult for the Badgers to be available for early weekend games. They ended up forfeiting some contests due to travel difficulties, he said.

“The schedule just didn’t mesh well with them,” said Taylor. “I’ve followed the female program for a while and you can see how much it’s improved over time, here in B.C. but also across Canada.

“We told the national level players that they could come out and tryout for any team in our league.”

He said the Badgers have decided to join the Vancouver Recreational Baseball League, which operates out of Burnaby’s Central Park and New West’s Queen’s Park.",[]

Also expected to be talked about is the directive issued a week ago by the Canadian Lacrosse Association that suspends all activity until April 5 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, BCJALL president Karl Christiansen said in a statement.

In an email response to query as to the status of Sunday’s planned meeting, Christiansen said the plan is still to meet.

“Everything is ever changing and very different than when we met 2 weeks ago. We will have our meeting Sunday and release information shortly after,” Christiansen said. “Our top priority is the health and safety of not just athletes, coaches (and) officials but also our fans and families involved with the BCJALL.

“These are trying times and we wish everyone great health and wellness.”

The league was scheduled to start the regular season play on April 25.

All minor lacrosse associations, including Burnaby and New West, are following edicts of the CLA and B.C. Lacrosse Association to suspend all in-person activities until further notice.

“We’re lucky to have had strong leadershiop from the province’s public health officials. This is why we’re basing our response on the expert advice of those organizations, as well as the B.C. Lacrosse Association and the (CLA),” NWMLA president Rich Catton said in a statement on the website.

As a result of the health concerns, New West has postponed its mini-tyke and tyke evaluation events, originally scheduled for March 31 and April 1, as well as the Olivia Malcom mini-tyke and tyke Jamboree, scheduled for April 4 and 5.

“We will continue to monitor the directives from our governing bodies as well as the federal and provincial governments and will follow and enforce these directives. We will update our membership when there is a change,” stated a post on the Burnaby minor website.

Meanwhile, the Western Lacrosse Association says its business as usual — for now.

But with the start of the regular season less than two months away, the league is monitoring the ever-evolving novel coronavirus outbreak, commissioner Paul Dal Monte said. He added none of the teams are currently practising.

The league’s website has removed its 2020 schedule, which was to begin May 21 with Maple Ridge visiting New West at Queen’s Park Arena. The Burnaby Lakers are to launch the 2020 season a day later, May 22, in Victoria.

Many of the league’s players who are part of teams in the professional National Lacrosse League are already idle as that circuit suspended its season two weeks ago.

The U.S. east coast-based professional outdoor Major League Lacrosse has not altered its schedule online from its May 31 opener, although the sport’s governing body in the United States has also postponed all events until at least April 5 as well as cancelled two national women’s tournaments scheduled in May.

In terms of overall global impact, however, the best comparison may be the 1918 influenza pandemic, which was inaccurately named “Spanish Flu.”

The NHL’s response to COVID-19 has likewise been compared to the 1918 pandemic for obvious reasons: the only year the Stanley Cup was not awarded was 1919, because of a flu outbreak that ravaged the roster of the Montreal Canadiens during the playoff series. The timeline for the pandemic and the hockey season deserves some closer scrutiny, however, as it provides an important warning.

article continues below

Just like now, the 1918 pandemic threw the world of sports into chaos. College football games were cancelled or postponed, though some ignored bans and played games in front of large crowds anyway. Bowling alleys were closed, to great protest, and the public was urged to stop gathering together for games of rugby and baseball.

Professional sports, however, continued unabated. The Major League Baseball season continued even as the flu spread across the United States. When the league ended the regular season early in September, it was because of World War I shutting down non-essential industries, not the flu, and the league still played the World Series later that month.

Perhaps it was for the best: the second wave of the flu struck in October and November, the deadliest wave of the pandemic. The early end to the MLB season might have saved lives.

The NHL, meanwhile, chose to begin their season as planned in December, despite the danger. To be fair, the league wasn’t playing to thousands of fans in large arenas at the time. The Montreal Canadiens played in Jubilee Arena, with a seating capacity of 3,000.

It was also a much, much smaller league. Just three teams played during the 1918-19 season: the Canadiens, Toronto Arenas, and Ottawa Senators. It was just the second season for the fledgling NHL and what threatened the league’s operations wasn’t influenza, but legal actions and competing leagues. This was despite one player, Hamby Shore of the Senators, already having died from the pandemic in October.

Only 18 games of the planned 20-game season were played, but again, it wasn’t because of concerns due to the flu. The Arenas, who were the defending Stanley Cup champions, were a mess behind the scenes — their players didn’t have contracts and were being paid under the table and attendance for the struggling Arenas was abysmal — and officially withdrew from the league in February.

The Canadiens defeated the Senators for the NHL championship and travelled to Seattle to play the Pacific Coast Hockey Association champion Seattle Metropolitans. Worry over the flu pandemic had subsided to a certain extent. After all, it had been a full year since the first outbreak in the US.

In Seattle, the schools had reopened in January. By March, no influenza deaths were reported in the city. It seemed like the danger had largely passed, so why not play for the Stanley Cup?

Then, in Game 5, veteran defenceman Joe Hall collapsed on the ice. He was hospitalized with a temperature of 104 F. Players on both teams reported symptoms of the flu and, eventually, all but three of the Canadiens players were diagnosed.

The Canadiens tried to forfeit the Cup to Seattle, but the Metropolitans refused to win the Cup that way and the series was cancelled. Hall contracted pneumonia and passed away a few days after the final game was to be played.

What can the NHL learn from this experience? One important aspect is that they can’t let their guard down. It seemed like the worst had passed when the Canadiens travelled to Seattle, but that clearly wasn’t the case. That strain of the flu even came back for another wave in 1920.

The other aspect is how quickly the flu was able to spread through the entire Canadiens roster. The NHL can’t get back to playing before there are clear protocols for identifying who is carrying the COVID-19 virus and quarantining those affected. That can’t happen until tests are widespread and readily available to the general population.

Most importantly, the NHL needs to understand that this could take a long time. While medical science has taken leaps and bounds in the last century, there’s no guarantee that the COVID-19 pandemic will be dealt with any faster than that of the 1918 flu pandemic. Fortunately, the league appears to be taking this pandemic far more seriously than a century ago.

Big Numbers

7 Under the more progressive PCHA rules, which allowed forward passing in all zones of the ice, the Metropolitans dominated the Canadiens in 1919, scoring 7 goals in Games 1 and 3. The Canadiens won two games played under NHL rules, while Game 4 ended in a tie.

Stick-taps and Glove-drops

A tap of the stick to all the healthcare workers in Vancouver, British Columbia, and around the world that are on the frontlines of this pandemic. In a just world, you’d all be paid like professional hockey players.

A stick-tap to Vancouver residents who have taken to cheering for said health care workers every evening at 7 p.m. Without being able to cheer for the Canucks, you’ve chosen the right people to cheer on.

Townsend, a senior, was named the Great Northwest Athletic Conference’s Female Indoor Track and Field Athlete of the Year on Monday.

The honour was voted on by GNAC coaches, and came after the 22-year-old captured both the women’s 800-metres and mile races at the GNAC championships. The wins automatically earned her a ticket for the NCAA Div. 2 Indoor championships, which have been cancelled due to the COVID-19 virus.

Making a strong impression as a first-year athlete was SFU’s Jeremiah Lauzon, who was named the Male Freshman of the Year.

Townsend picked up her fourth consecutive 800m conference title with a time of 2:10.87 last month, and added the mile in 4:58.62

As the leadoff runner on the Clan’s championship-winning distance medley relay team, the Coquitlam athlete punched another ticket to the nationals. Earlier, Townsend was chosen as the GNAC Championships Female Track Athlete of the Week, as well as the USTFCCCA West Region Female Track Athlete of the Year.

Her best time this year in the 800m was 2:07.74, which ranked second in Div. 2, and seventh on the GNAC all-time list. In the mile, Townsend recorded a 4:40.40 time, rated third in Div. 2 and second on the all-time GNAC list.

Lauzon enjoyed a stellar debut on the Div. 2 circuit, taking the GNAC championship title in the 200m dash, with a time of 21.71 seconds. He also ran as part of SFU’s third-place 4x400m relay team. A native of Red Deer, Alberta, Lauzon made the most of two separate meets in Boston, setting the GNAC record in the 200m with a time of 21.55 at the John Thomas Terrier Classic in January, then trimmed that time to 21.47 two weeks later at the David Hemery Valentine Classic.

Burnaby's Gabriel Ho-Garcia said Sunday's announcement by the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) and Canadian Paralympic Committee (CPC) to not to send teams to the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo was the right call.

article continues below

That doesn't mean it didn't hurt.

""I'd love to go and compete in another Olympics, and hopefully I will, but in the grand scheme of things this is about public health, about everyone,"" said Ho-Garcia in an interview with the Burnaby NOW on Monday.

""We're in bit of limbo because we're hoping (the IOC) postpones the Games, but we don't know.""

A member of the 2016 Rio Olympics team, Ho-Garcia said this squad's journey had been hard-fought and fully earned. However, like a lot of things in everyday life, it understandably takes a back seat as nations face a deadly pandemic.

""It became apparent that the decision had to be made, because the Olympics is such a massive event,"" he said. ""It would only take one person carrying the virus into the (Olympic) village, where it would spread, and people would then take it back to their home countries. It's devastating.""

The Canadian team had earned its berth with a dramatic two-game series win over Ireland in North Vancouver last October.

As the team continued to prepare for the Olympics, it became apparent when they were in Chile in mid-to-late January for a test match series that the Games could be in trouble as news from China kept coming out.

“We were (in Chile) when news of the virus broke out,” said Ho-Garcia, 26. “We arrived home and while Tokyo’s close to China, it wasn’t clear that it would get to where we are now. It just started to get closer and closer, so we had to prepare ourselves (for no Games).”

He's thankful that his family and friends are safe and healthy, and is finding ways to adapt his training sessions. But it has been an adjustment.

""The past week I've been in isolation, but I've taken walks, runs to stay exercising. We've been fortunate to have access to world-class facilities as (Burnaby's) Fortius Sport and Health up until (it was closed due to the recommendations of health officials). When you're use to that and now trying on my own with a yoga mat in the living room, it's a bit of a transition,"" he said.

While the team was fairly well informed as to what was happening, it all hit home when professional sports suddenly went dark.

""I think that's when it really hit home for everyone. Here you have sports leagues close down. It was like, 'Wow.' That's a big part of our (entertainment) world, and it's a lot of money.""

The COC and CPC have also urged the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to postpone the Games for one year.

“We offer them our full support in helping navigate all the complexities that rescheduling the Games will bring. While we recognize the inherent complexities around a postponement, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our athletes and the world community,” the Canadian organizations stated in a joint statement.

After the 2016 Games, Ho-Garcia set his sights on getting his masters degree in business management, while also pushing to maintain a spot on the national team. He played professionally in Germany with both Mulheim and Mannheimer clubs, as well as Club de Campo in Spain.

It's that rich playing experience that he's grateful for, and acknowledges a potential loss of the Olympics would be greatly disappointing. He said who he feels mostly for are the teammates and other athletes who are striving to get to their first Olympiad.

""A number of us are fortunate enough to have already had an Olympic experience,"" he said. ""It's unbelievable, in all aspects, what's going on right now. It's hard but you can't downplay it. I really feel badly for those who've spent the past four years, who've qualifed or were still trying to qualify, and to get so close.""

The funding of Olympic and national team athletes has improved a lot since the start of the last decade, and Ho-Garcia believes stronger commitment from the Canadian government has helped create a solid foundation for athletes. Not only in the area of funds which help in training and allow for full-time dedication, but also in areas such as mental health support, he said.

He faces the dire reality that most could never envision a mere month ago. The plan was to compete and represent Canada in Tokyo, then turn and use his education to begin his career. COVID-19 has caused havoc and left no one untouched. Health is paramount, he said.

""It's a weird time but I'm hoping for the best,"" said Ho-Garcia. ""People are sick, losing their jobs. There are a lot of people who are suffering, so sports has to take a back seat.""",[]

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

We are blessed with acres of untouched rainforest in B.C., and experiencing the sights and sounds of the coast, including globally renowned Desolation Sound, is a rite of passage for British Columbians, and a must for international travellers.

Pacific Coastal Cruises & Tours and Homfray Lodge offer an intimate experience which helps connect people to nature and the authentic B.C. coast. Equipped to navigate through hidden channels, the Pacific Bear, a refurbished fishing boat, offers you incomparable views of Desolation Sound, virtually unchanged from its earliest discovery. Says Pacific Coastal Cruises & Tours founder George Bartel: “It’s a twist on traditional cruising… I’ve been in the travel business for almost 40 years, and I’m interested in reshaping how people experience this part of the world. It’s an experience that you are unable to find anywhere else.”

Passengers of the Pacific Bear will have an all-inclusive wilderness lodge experience which includes a stay at Homfray Lodge on the remote waters of Homfray Channel in Desolation Sound, as well as Grizzly Bears tours.

Desolation Sound has the warmest waters of the B.C. coast with temperatures in the Sound often exceeding 22°C (75°F) from June to September. It is the second-deepest sound in North America, reaching depths of 2,400 feet with peaks rising up to 8,000 feet from the water. With less than a knot of current, many global boaters and sea kayakers regard Desolation Sound as a spectacular destination.

This coastal haven of deep fjords and towering 7,000-foot peaks, boasts spectacular waterfalls, glacier-fed rivers and magnificent Coastal Mountains in the backdrop. And the small size of the boat allows guests to get up-close-and-personal with the fjords. “On the boat, there’s a rooftop where you can have lunch. We stop at the waterfalls and get so close that we can feel the splash of the water on our cheeks,” says Sabrina Ouellette, reservations coordinator at Pacific Coastal Cruises & Tours, which runs the tours.

Exclusive and personal, Pacific Coastal Cruises & Tours and stays at Homfray Lodge have tailored different kinds of journeys for you, where you can access the best places on the BC coast.

For Mike Mollica, the founder of MGM Financial Group, making sure clients have good advice that helps them reach their goals is only part of the picture.

article continues below

“We want our clients and their families to be able to focus on what’s important to them, knowing they can entrust us with taking care of their financial affairs,” he said. “We offer advice, but more importantly, peace of mind.”

The independent financial advisory firm focuses on wealth management strategies for business owners, professionals, and families, and can help people with investments, insurance, benefits, cash flow planning, tax planning, estate planning, and corporate/business tax planning.

Mollica has been in the financial services industry for 17 years. He started out in banking, completed his education in corporate finance at BCIT, then joined one of the most well respected wealth management firms in BC.

“This is where my passion for numbers and finance met with the desire to help people achieve their financial and life goals, whatever they may be,” he said. “I worked there for a few years before deciding to venture out on my own. I truly enjoy that I can be an integral part of helping people achieve their personal and financial goals.”

The decision to create his own path has been a resounding success. MGM Financial has continued to grow with sterling recommendations from clients, and the team now includes a second advisor, Steven Kanjer, along with two office administrators.

Together, they help a wide variety of clients – with an equally wide variety of goals and needs – by making sure that each person has a personalized plan.

“A phrase that has continued to resonate with me over the years is that a goal without a plan is only a wish,” he said. “I truly believe that if you have a goal without a plan, the goal will be very hard to achieve regardless of what it is.”

Creating that plan and putting it into action is where Mollica and his team excel.

“For me, excellence is determined by what I’d expect if the roles were reversed,” he said. “If I was a client, what would I want from an advisor in my role. We listen to what’s important to our clients and lay out a plan to help them achieve that. We always go above and beyond to make sure that the true reason for why we’re meeting is addressed.”

Sometimes, the first step of that process is simply helping people feel comfortable.

“I want people to know that it’s not as scary and complex as they think,” he said. “With some proper guidance and advice, we can simplify the scary or complex to help them come up with a plan that works for them.”

As someone who was born and raised in Burnaby and still lives here today, it was an easy decision to base his business in the Burnaby Heights neighbourhood.

“This area continues to grow and draw people, and my clients love it because I’m centrally located,” he said. “The Heights is one of the best business communities in the Lower Mainland and I am very happy to be part of this family.”

For the team at Trinity Physiotherapy, Sport & Wellness, the answer is simple: everything.

article continues below

The clinic, which opened in October 2017, offers a spectrum of services including physiotherapy, massage therapy and personal training. Owner and physiotherapist, Stephen Barclay says the name is an important reflection of the clinic’s values and approach.

“The name is very significant to the us as it embodies the understanding of the combination of mental, physical and spiritual care of our clients,” says Barclay. “It demonstrates a respect to the many sides of health and wellness. Our clinic focuses on assessing and treating the whole person and offering the very best holistic care.”

“It represents the idea of how, when we faithfully use our skills and talents to the best of our ability, it lets our light shine, allowing those around us the permission to do the same.”

The thoughtful approach to all aspects of a client’s wellbeing has already garnered the clinic a stellar reputation that continues to grow. Since opening its doors, the clinic has already tripled its staff as new clients – with diverse health, wellness, and rehabilitation goals – continue to hear about the services at Trinity.

“The reception and support from our clients has been outstanding,” he said. “And for this we are truly grateful. The vast majority of our clientele is from word of mouth and client referral. The highest compliment we can receive is when a client recommends our clinic to their family or friends. It makes us feel proud that the client’s experience has been so outstanding that they freely want others to experience it.”

It’s perhaps no surprise how quickly the clinic has made a name for itself. The team of physiotherapists, massage therapists, and personal trainers have collectively obtained some of the highest qualifications and credentials in the Lower Mainland. Trinity is the only clinic in Burnaby where each physiotherapist has obtained the designation of Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Manipulative Physiotherapy, the highest possible qualification in manual therapy, which involves many years of post-graduate training.

Barclay notes that the team also includes the highest qualified vestibular therapist in Burnaby, mentors and instructors for the Canadian Physiotherapy Association, and therapists who have worked with elite athletes at the Olympic Games – just a few of the unique highlights, skills, and talents at Trinity.

“One of the amazing features of our clinic, under the consent from our clients, is our staff has the ability to collaborate with each other – we can be much more effective when each practitioner can combine their thoughts and offer their ideas on the best care of the client. We also have a large and well-equipped gym with the latest technology features to enhance fitness and treatment goals.”

And ultimately, that’s what it all comes down to: providing the highest quality of care possible for everyone who comes to Trinity.

“We achieve excellence by our high level of staff experience, our dedication to understanding our client’s individual needs, and our provision of care in a state-of-the-art clinic and gym.”

Trinity is located inside the SOLO tower at Willingdon and Lougheed, in the heart of Burnaby, allowing for central access to clients from around the region.

The newly-built Reading Room is open to anyone of any faith and was designed to provide people with a safe, comfortable, and non-confrontational environment in which to come together to learn more about Christianity.

article continues below

The Reading Room is operated by Willoughby Heights Canadian Reformed Church and each Wednesday, they study a different part of the Bible and discuss its meaning. One week they might discuss the creation and fall of mankind; another week, they could be discussing God’s plan to redeem His Church.

“We discuss the Christian faith, ask questions about it, and consider its history,” says one volunteer, a church member of Willoughby Heights Canadian Reformed Church. “We have different confessions, study them as they relate back to the Bible, and apply it to the context of modern day living.”

The Bible study draws from texts in the English Standard Version or New International Version published in 1984.

As a church member, one volunteer has seen many fellow church members feeling lost in the hustle and bustle of modern day life. And this volunteer sees the Bible study sessions at the Reading Room as a way for people to feel more grounded and ask questions about life.

“It’s an interesting challenge,” the volunteer says. “I see a lot of people with questions about life in general—the purpose of life, the meaninglessness of life. During Bible study and in the Reading Room, we can offer an alternative line of thought for those struggling with these questions.”

Bible study at the Reading Room in Burnaby attracts a range of people from a variety of backgrounds and cultures, ages and experiences.

Since opening its doors last July, attendance has steadily grown.

“We’ve generally had groups of eight consistently attending,” says one volunteer. “And it varies right across the board, both men and women, all different ages. Different people drop by with different interests. The space probably allows for about 15 people, but nobody will be turned down.”

Bible study at the Reading Room in Burnaby takes place Wednesday evenings at 8 p.m.

""People asking this question are generally thinking that it would be good to pay for tomorrow's cost today,"" says Nicole Renwick, Executive Director of the Memorial Society of B.C. ""And they want to save their loved ones the bother of making financial decisions after they have passed, and there are a few other options.""

article continues below

For a nominal membership fee, the Memorial Society can work with you to pre-plan, rather than pre-pay, your funeral and arrangements for the disposal of your remains.

""We've been helping people with end of life arrangements for more than sixty years,"" Nicole notes. ""We have in excess of 242,000 members around the province, making us the largest memorial society in North America.""

Pre-planning with the Memorial Society is as simple as filling in an arrangement form detailing your wishes, and then making sure your survivors are aware of your membership in the Society.

""When end of life occurs,"" Nicole explains, ""the survivor should call us first. We will then refer them to a funeral home that is registered with us and with whom we have negotiated a member discount.""

While pre-paying is an option, there are other options to keep in mind such as the CPP Death Benefit or taking out a GIC with your executor. If you do decide to pre-pay your costs here are a few points to keep mind:

· You may move away from the area where your selected funeral home is located.

· If you ask for a refund from a funeral service provider for any reason after 30 days of signing a pre-payment contract, the provider is entitled to retain up to 20 percent of your money.

· A pre-payment contract usually does not include all the costs incurred at the time of death. For example, catering, flowers, cost for death certificates etc. are not included.

· If your survivors do not know about the pre-payments, it is possible that the money will be lost.

""We can give you peace of mind through pre-planning,"" she says, ""and relieve your loved ones of stress at an emotional time, while also making sure they receive a discounted rate on the provision of funeral services.""

His training as a dental technician in his native South Korea is what led him to eventually train as a denturist after he moved to Canada. “I liked communicating with the patients so I decided to study denturism,” he explains over the phone from his clinic on Edmonds Street in Burnaby.

Park has been working as a dental technician for almost nine years in Canada. After he moved to Vancouver, he worked under a dentist in a lab for four-and-a-half years, where he also trained with Vancouver Community College’s Denturist program. After working in a variety of denture clinics, in 2017 Park opened his own clinic and lab in Burnaby on Edmonds Street.

His business, Duke Park Denture Clinic and Laboratory, occupies a space shared with Edmonds Dental. Here, he provides all services related to the fabrication and fitting of dentures. In addition to regular appointments, he offers mobiles services and accepts walk-ins and emergency cases. Park is currently planning to grow his business and is taking on new patients.

Here in Canada, Park is thankful for being able to provide a specialized service not available in his homeland. “In South Korea there are not denturists; there are only dentists and dental technicians,” he explains.He loves that because he runs a denture clinic with an in-house lab, he can provide an accurate and fast one-stop-service which can include consultation, oral exam, fabrication and insertion of dentures in one place.

Duke says some people are hesitant about getting dentures (and regular check-ups) because of the cost or the stigma involved. But he says having those procedures can save a lot of money and pain in the long run. “If you lose teeth but don’t replace them it will be hard to chew [which can lead to other problems and impact quality of life] … And your smile won’t look as beautiful as it could.”

But one of the challenges I’ve come across with non-toxic products is that what I gain in natural ingredients, I often lose in effectiveness. (It took much trial and error to finally find a natural deodorant that works, and now I’m hooked on Sola). I’m a huge fan of SPF for its melanoma- and wrinkle-preventing properties (I wear at least SPF 15 on my face year-round), but up until now I haven’t come across a non-toxic sunscreen line that is free of harsh chemicals.

When it comes to evaluating whether a product is safe to put on my skin and hair, I use the Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep database. I simply type in the name of the product and the database provides a rating from 1 to 10 (1 being the least toxic and 10 being the most).

Dr. Mark Lupin of Cosmedica in Victoria says when shopping for a non-toxic sunscreen or sunblock you should look for a formula that uses mineral active ingredients such as zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide, instead of the chemical filters oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate and octinoxate included in most sunscreens on the market. Also, look for the words ""Broad Spectrum” on the sunscreen label as this indicates that, in addition to UVB protection represented by the SPF rating, the product also protects from UVA rays which can contribute to skin cancer and premature aging.

Here are four non-toxic suncare brands I recommend trying this summer:

1) Beautycounter, the skincare and makeup line known for its commitment to using non-toxic ingredients, has just launched a line of non-toxic suncare products for body and face formulated with non-nano zinc oxide and antioxidant-rich California Poppy. Most of the products boast EWG ratings of 1 and are available in mist, lotion and stick formulas, perfect for the whole family to use.

2) Vancouver-based natural product brand A Healthy Beginning makes a zinc oxide-based SPF 25 Whipped Mineral Sun Butter which contains raspberry seed oil to boost sun protection and hydrate the skin. All ingredients have a low EWG rating, the product packaging uses minimal plastic, and the butter can be used on the face and body (and is perfect for kids, too).

3) Josie Maran loves her argan oil and she makes a beautifully scented, chemical-free facial oil that protects with an SPF of 47, and is available at Sephora.

4) Also available at Sephora with EWG ratings between 1 and 3 is Coola's range of non-toxic SPF products which includes a White Tea Face Sport SPF 50 and an SPF 30 Sunscreen Spray Pina Colada.

Whichever sunscreen you choose, be sure to apply 30 minutes before sun exposure, reapplying every two hours, and after swimming.

Says Adele Fussi, its general manager: “Derby Manor is there for people caught between that gap of people who don’t qualify for government assistance but can’t afford a $5,000-a-month private residence.”

Residents also receive two meals a day plus snacks, free Wifi, housekeeping and laundry services. Additionally, there is a hair salon, a foot nurse and a mobile spa at the ready.

Residents will never be bored, explains Fussi, as there are constantly activities and events being planned for them. “Three times a week we take residents out to the mall or on outdoor trips up to the trails.” There is also a barbeque that is used for gatherings on the terrace, an arts and crafts room, a library and a baby grand piano that a professional pianist comes to play twice per week. Finally, a large private dining room, which accommodates friends and family, can be booked anytime. “At Christmas we had 80 people come have dinner with their loved ones,” says Fussi.

With so much on offer at such an affordable price, one would expect a mile-long waiting to rent a suite at Derby Manor. Surprisingly, that’s not the case, says Fussi. “We opened in May 2017 and currently there is no waiting list … Thirty five [of 122] suites are rented now but we are expecting full capacity by April 2018.”

Though many people could benefit from wearing dentures, Park says some people are hesitant about undergoing these procedures because of the cost or the stigma involved. But these fixes can drastically improve a patient’s quality of life: “I see many situations where people have upper dentures but no lower posterior dentures. In this case adding back lower dentures would allow them to eat more, to be healthier and to have better quality of life.” This will also help prevent the upper dentures from falling out compared to if only the lower anterior teeth were remaining.

Park also urges people to take action and replace missing teeth (even if it’s just one or two that are missing) and to get regular check-ups to maintain dental hygiene. “It saves money and pain in the future,” he explains.

There is also the option of creating dentures that fit over implant abutments: “This way patients can wear dentures and they won’t fall out as easily,” Park explains.

When it comes to taking care of dentures Park has a few tips. First, be sure to get check-ups every six months to ensure there are no issues that need resolving. Next, always take dentures out at night and soak them in water with a cleaning tablet (such as Polident). And it’s best not to use toothpaste when cleaning dentures: instead, use a denture paste or an antibacterial soap.

Finally, don’t forget to smile and show off your beautiful new teeth! Says Park: “The best part of my job is checking a patient’s smile after I’ve inserted their new dentures.”

“AgeCare is founded on the belief that all seniors are entitled to a rich quality of life, with the opportunity to live as independently as possible,” says AgeCare’s Joel Grigg. “Our philosophy and guiding principles ensure that our residents lead a rewarding life, each and every day.”

Since their inception in 1998, AgeCare has been dedicated to changing the face of retirement living. Focused on building vibrant communities that celebrate and support independence and interaction, AgeCare is helping residents to enjoy healthier and happier lives long into their retirement.

AgeCare is known for their high-quality, resident centered approach to services and care, including Harmony Court Estate and the Harmony Court Care Centre right here in Burnaby.

Located in South Burnaby, on Canada Way at Edmonds Street, the centrally situated retirement community is close to all conveniences including public transit. Filled with newly renovated suites, AgeCare Harmony Court Estate’s affordable, all-inclusive rates are second to none, offering wellness programs, artistic pursuits, community outings, entertainment, social gatherings, weekly housekeeping, and delicious meals and snacks.

“Our goal is always to foster a community atmosphere where individuals are recognized, valued and celebrated for themselves,” says Joel Grigg. “Our resident centered principles ensure that our residents get the activities and trips they desire and the nutritious meals that they crave.”

With over 55 years cumulative financial experience between the three Sea Glass Wealth Advisory Group team members, Tracey Lundell, Kristina Thomas and Sheryl Thomas, have all worked in the financial industry.

“We have an understanding of everything from basic chequing accounts all the way through to very complex investment planning solutions,” Tracey explains.

The Sea Glass Wealth Advisory Group team enjoys planning for families that are looking to transition wealth between generations.

“Because we’re an all-female team, we tend to meet the women in the family first,” says Tracey, “but we involve all family members in planning for inter-generational wealth transfer.”

Tracey and her colleagues advise meeting with them first, before launching into the planning process.

“The first meeting,” says Tracey “is more a ‘get-to-know’ session, where we decide if we’re a good fit for the client. The second meeting is more detailed and personal and we outline any costs that will be involved for our services. There’s no cost before a client decides that they’re happy working with us.”

In addition to investment planning, Sea Glass Wealth Advisory Group team members also hold informational workshops and seminars.

“We hold sessions here at Harbourfront Wealth offices, off-site at work places, or in public spaces. Contact us for a schedule of events.”

On one hand, market volatility is a worry as you seek to maintain and grow your capital, while the safety of GICs (Guaranteed Income Certificates) usually provides little growth.

Red tape can hold up transferring or affecting the amount your beneficiaries receive from your estate funds.

And creditors can pop up unexpectedly and erode your investments.

Is there a way to help protect your hard-earned wealth from those scenarios?

Bridge to Prosperity, a unique business and wealth management firm, uses a strategy that deals with that. It’s called Segregated Funds.

But what are Segregated Funds?

Like Mutual Funds, they are a large pool of money belonging to many people, invested in stocks, bonds, etc., with the goal of increasing the value of the entire pool.

However, unlike Mutual Funds, Segregated Funds have special benefits that Mutual Funds do not have.

For example:

· Maturity Guarantees ensure the value of your investment at maturity. It will not be less than a specified percentage of the amount you invested. You can also choose to have the ability to “lock in” market gains in your investments.

· Death Benefit Guarantees ensure your beneficiaries will receive the guaranteed amount or the market value of your investments — whichever is higher, providing an alternative life insurance option for people who cannot attain coverage due to health issues.

· Segregated Funds have the ability to bypass probate, which allows your beneficiaries to receive the payout faster and privately, while avoiding the applicable probate costs.

· Your Segregated Fund assets may also be protected from creditors in the event of bankruptcy.

· And since Segregated Funds contracts allow you to name beneficiaries, it is a great way to bequest funds to your children, grandchildren and/or your favourite charity!

If you are a conservative investor, who likes to earn more than the typical GIC returns, Segregated Funds may be the way to go.

“I checked at the self-checker,” said Gill. “I told my son, and then I had to go to another gas station to make sure it was correct. After I told my wife, they both thought I was joking and didn’t believe me.”

Gill says the $1 million means he can take a step back from work.

“It’ll be nice to not have to work so hard,” laughed Gill. “I’ll still continue to … I want to start my own business.”

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

What to look out for

The BBB says consumers should look out for the following red flags is they are searching for a lender or loan broker:

You receive unsolicited communication (phone call, text message, email) offering an easy loan.

The health authority added the outbreak of C. difficile to its list of current outbreaks on July 14.

article continues below

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Rash

If you are visiting someone who is located on an outbreak unit, visitors may be limited to two people at a time. Fraser Health asks that you do not visit other patient rooms or common areas on the unit such as the lounge and patient kitchenette. It also recommends you don’t visit public areas in the hospital such as the cafeteria and gift shop.",[]

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

For those who don’t want to delay their vows and are happy to forego a large wedding, Anvil Centre in New Westminster is offering micro weddings — small and highly personalized events to tie the knot.

“Now that people can’t have these big weddings, we want to give them an intimate option that is an engaging and memorable way to celebrate their special day,” says Heidi Hughes, director of sales and marketing at Anvil Centre.

“Because we don’thave a crystal ball to know what next year will bring in terms of guidelines for gatherings, this is the perfect option for couples who don’t want to delay their ceremonies.”

Many couples with upcoming weddings were originally planning on a larger event, Hughes says. To include friends and families on their special day in a meaningful way, Anvil Centre offers the option of including multiple video cameras to allow for streaming the ceremony and reception.

Video camera setups include a monitor at the head table, so guests watching the events unfold remotely can get a high-quality, unobstructed view of the newlyweds.

Hughes says that in light of recent COVID-19 gathering restrictions, Anvil Centre staff pushed themselves to think of creative solutions to allow people to celebrate special events in a way that still felt significant. She credits the recent move to working from home for allowing people to be more receptive to the idea of attending a wedding virtually.

“People are becoming comfortable with the fact that these types of online things will be the new normal,” Hughes says.

“Now, with everyone getting so involved with virtual meetings, this is something that we’re getting used to.”

Anvil Centre is the City of New Westminster’s multi-purpose civic centre that brings together meeting and event space with a performing arts theatre and art gallery.

No stranger to hosting weddings, Anvil Centre is a boutique-style venue with stunning architecture. It offers a full slate of top-notch services, including event management and catering professionals to assist couples in creating an unforgettable day.

Wedding planning can be stressful, but Anvil Centre provides peace of mind as a full-service venue that can accommodate any event from formal plated dinners to cocktail receptions. All services have been adapted to comply with health and safety protocols to keep guests and staff safe at all times.In addition, beverage service, including all liquor, is provided by Anvil Centre. They are also able to provide both cash bar and host bar services.

Micro weddings offer an advantage for couples who don’t want to wait to get married, Hughes says.

“With fewer guests, what you’re able to do is really focus on personalization. Hand-written notes and menus, customized meals, and everything catered to your specific tastes so you don’t have to worry about pleasing a large group. You really can do a lot more with a smaller event,” Hughes says.

“It’s about ensuring intimacy for the on-site guests, but at the same time using virtual technology to connect those who can’t attend in person due to restrictions on gatherings.”

To accommodate increased social distancing at weddings, Anvil Centre is also reducing the number of people seated at a table, placing the tables further apart and putting in a larger dance floor.

“We really want people out there to know that this is an option for their weddings,” Hughes says.

She encourages anyone who is curious about the event space to make arrangements to come and have a tour of what Anvil Centre can offer.

“We’re about creating experiences that are still engaging and feel intimate even if you have this physical distancing,” Hughes says.

“For couples who don’t want to wait, micro weddings are a great option.”",[]
212,burnabynow,https://www.burnabynow.com/lifestyle/live-well-clinics-safely-reopen-across-the-province-1.24150333,LIVE WELL clinics safely reopen across the province,[],,"As British Columbia loosens its COVID-19 restrictions, LIVE WELL Exercise Clinics are re-opening across the province with enhanced safety precautions in mind.

""Focus on member health and safety has always been extremely important to us,"" says Cameron Biffart, clinic director of the Kelowna LIVE WELL.

""Our protocols going into COVID-19 were probably what a lot of gyms will come out of the pandemic with. In addition, we've taken our sanitation and cleaning standards and stepped them up dramatically. We've placed a real emphasis on following health authorities and going above and beyond guidelines.""

While Biffart's Kelowna clinic opened up on June 1, the rest of the clinics in B.C. will be welcoming members back from June 15 through the first week of July with enhanced health and safety measures.

So far, LIVE WELL's clients have been extremely happy with the enhanced health measures and are confident in their safety while working out at the clinics.

""I did not hesitate to come back for my regular exercise sessions. LIVE WELL has always been very clean and sterile, which is very important for me due to my allergies and asthma,"" client Ayla Kilic says.

""Now, the personnel at the clinic are even more careful in maintaining sanitation and cleanliness. The new positioning of exercise equipment maintains social distancing, and the trainers ensure that everybody is following the safety standards. They keep the equipment clean and sterile while providing the best professional and personal care to us. I feel very safe exercising at the clinic, and I appreciate everybody's effort to provide us with this safe venue to exercise"".

LIVE WELL Exercise Clinics has many locations across B.C. and other parts of Canada. Every clinic focuses on providing customized exercise programs for each member to help reach their personal health goals.

""Most of our members will have one health condition or concern,"" says Biffart. ""We work with people with heart disease, obesity, arthritis, and a variety of other ailments and diseases, including those who are recovering from knee and hip replacements.""

LIVE WELL is inviting anyone interested in learning more about its personalized exercise programs to tour a clinic near you by signing up online.

""There's no 'gym-timidation' here,"" Biffart says. ""Most of our members come to us because they want that extra care and attention that we can provide that a big box gym can't. We have a very warm and inviting community-based atmosphere. It's very easy for new people to come in and immediately feel like they're part of things.""

LIVE WELL's staff includes university-educated kinesiologists and clinical exercise physiologists that often work together to help clients meet their goals. When new members come in for an initial consultation, LIVE WELL's staff does a full medical intake and a baseline assessment to determine where they are in their fitness journey. From there, a customized exercise plan is created, including participation in small classes.

""From the very first time I stepped into Live Well, I knew it was going to be amazing. I have never experienced a gym like this and am truly grateful for the opportunity to be a member,"" client Rebecca Donald says.

All workouts are by appointment, and members have set schedules to know ahead of time when to come into the clinic. Roughly hour-long classes with a maximum of 12 people are overseen by two staff members, who provide oversight and coaching throughout the session.

""Members have a constant sense of being guided through their workouts,"" Biffart says. ""Because we cater to people who don't have a background in exercise, we do everything we can to make them feel comfortable and help them work on that confidence. They get a real sense of accomplishment.""

LIVE WELL has also introduced two new online programs for existing members to foster support and access. One is LIVE WELL At Home, an online personalized exercise program that can be accessed through a member portal online. This allows members to log in wherever and whenever to do their exercises. The fitness clinics have also introduced LIVE WELL Live, which will enable members to join via video conferencing to be led through their exercises in a traditional class environment.

""It provides that social aspect of a live instructor,"" Biffart says. ""An important part of what we do is that social aspect and creating community.""

That community is part of the accountability that LIVE WELL creates for its members, partly credited to the same group of people sharing classes week in and week out. Biffart encourages anyone who is curious about the LIVE WELL experience to come in and see the clinic.

""Any concerns, insecurity or fears you have will be cleared up when you come in and see that we don't have that typical gym-feel.""

Finding the right person for the job can be a challenge, but the choice is rewarding when you go with Anthony Walker and the crew at Walker Painting.

Tony, as his friends and clients call him, has been painting and improving homes in the Lower

Mainland for more than thirty years and has gained a wealth of experience in that time.

“The first house I painted was an old heritage home in East Vancouver, and over the years I’ve gained an expertise in dealing with older, more challenging homes in need of more than just your basic paint job” he says.

“Many homes often require some minor repairs such as damaged siding or trim that can be a problem to have repaired separately but which we can easily include in our scope of work.”

Unlike some bigger companies, Walker Painting treats each job with individual care and

attention. “I’m personally involved in every aspect of each job” Walker says. “I meet the client for the quote and personally oversee everything from power-washing and prep to painting and repairs.”

Tony also has an artistic background along with his experience as a house painter that gives him a great eye for colour recommendations should you require a consultation in that regard.

A full exterior paint job should be done every five to ten years but if that’s not in the budget at this time then Walker Painting is also ready to maintain the exterior so that the elements don’t create a bigger problem down the road. Gutter cleaning, power washing and repairs should still be kept up between paint jobs to ensure bigger problems don’t ensue.

Although interior painting and wallpapering is a specialty for Walker Painting, it may not be something we’re considering while keeping social distancing at this time.

Walker Painting will be taking ‘vacant’ interior jobs where proximity is not an issue.

“Experience and just general common sense is of far greater importance where interior work is concerned,” advises Walker. “You really need to trust the skill and references of the people you let into your house.”

Walker Painting is a licenced, insured member of the Better Business Bureau in good standing with solid references.

As a business owner-operator, Walker understands that home improvements can be cost-prohibitive which is why he is happy to announce special discounts and payment plans during this particularly difficult and unprecedented time. A discount on all work of five percent (GST) is in effect as well as a ten percent seniors discount. Payments can also be arranged on a personalized time-line if necessary. So whether you’re doing a bigger job or just need to clean things up with some maintenance, Walker Painting is the right choice you will always want to stay with.",[]
214,burnabynow,https://www.burnabynow.com/lifestyle/allergy-sufferers-breathe-easier-with-hardwood-flooring-1.24117989,Allergy sufferers breathe easier with hardwood flooring,[],,"While some love the sight of spring blossoming along streets and in parks, the seasonal shift weighs heavily on allergy-sufferers. Peter Pocrnic, Owner of Casa Madera Hardwood Flooring, relates to the allergy blues and says cats are a big allergic trigger for him.

These days, Pocrnic is on a mission to help people understand that the best way to battle allergies at home is with proper upkeep and care– along with hardwood floors. According to Asthma Canada, respiratory allergies affect one in five Canadians, with the main culprits being hayfever and dust mites.

Dust is an inescapable part of modern life, but having hardwood floors helps keep a lid on dust – unlike carpets, which trap dust and allow dust mites to take cover. Using rugs over hardwood give the best of both worlds, with rugs that can be easily cleaned, or even put away when pollen season rears its head.

For over 15 years, Casa Madera Hardwood Flooring has been a staple in Burnaby Heights. Voted, as the city’s most loved flooring store for eight years running.

Service, quality products, being accountable to customers, and offering great prices are all part of why Casa Madera has been so trusted by the local community for so long.

Making homes beautiful is something Pocrnic loves but making homes healthier is what really drives him. Years ago, a customer with a fully carpeted home had a hyperallergic son, and one of his triggers was dust. Hospital visits were frequent for them and medications were a must. Pocrnic was sure that Casa Madera’s flooring could help turn things around. He and his team swapped out the carpet in the boy’s room for some hardwood flooring. In the coming weeks and months, the boy’s condition dramatically improved as his allergies became manageable.

Installing hardwood doesn’t make dust go away. In fact, you’ll see more dust bunnies than ever! But what you can see— you can control, unlike with dust mites that can be trapped not just inside the carpet, but also under it and out of your reach.

For those dealing with respiratory issues and allergies, hardwood is often a life-changing home décor choice. Not all products are equal, but with over two decades of flooring expertise behind him, Peter Pocrnic enjoys helping customers make the best choice for their aesthetics and their health.

Even skin conditions and irritated eyes can be exacerbated by dust and pet dander, and these can be helped or even alleviated with easy-to-maintain hardwood flooring.

Casa Madera offers more than just hardwood flooring, too.

Casa Madera specializes in hardwood, laminate, cork, and specialty vinyl plank flooring products. - iStock

Their engineered and laminate floors offer all the durability of modern design with classic wood finishes. Luxury vinyl flooring is on offer as well. Cork floors are another option, which can be great for those with stiff joints or who are looking for better climate control and sound absorption.

From sleek, clean Scandinavian style hard maple wood floors through to the exotic, dramatic grain of tigerwood, vast are today’s wood flooring options for the discerning homeowner.

Installation is where the Casa Madera team shines most. Past customers like Laura Lange rave about the attention to detail not just on the floors, but with following strata regulations for her housing complex and even reducing their invoice when the job was easier than estimated.

Installing hardwood is a big investment, but when it comes to picking your new flooring, it might help to know that over 90 percent of realtors say that hardwood floors help a home sell faster. According to the National Association of Realtors, over 54% of buyers are willing to pay more for a home with hardwood. In fact, estimates state that homes with wood flooring increase the sale price by as much as 2.5 percent.

All those numbers are great, but if you’re in your forever home, most of today’s floors come with 20- or 25-year warranties. Down the line, if you feel like refinishing your floors, that’s always a great way to bring new life to a solid investment, unlike with carpeting. And of course, Casa Madera can help with refinishing, too.

Even if you’re just considering flooring for the future, Peter Pocrnic encourages you to reach out and say hello— learn about your options. From budget and lifestyle to space and aesthetic, it’s good to get a seasoned pro’s help on what might be the best product for you, especially if you’re after a solution for allergies.",[]

Now, as the number of people with COVID-19 continues to climb and pressures on hospitals mount, one question looms large — are we prepared?

“We are going to do everything we can to ensure we are taking care of the people who are taking care of us,” says Kristy James, CEO of the Burnaby Hospital Foundation.

Last week, the Foundation launched its COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund.

The goal is to raise funds to purchase urgently needed equipment to deal with a potential influx of cases needing emergency care. Some of those needs include ICU beds, C-MAC videolaryngoscopes, cardiac monitors, and as the situation continues to evolve, other equipment as requested by Burnaby Hospital’s health care professionals.

“We want to be prepared for every issue our frontline staff might face by having the proper equipment on hand,” James says.

The fund will also support frontline workers who have been risking their own health to take care of patients’ needs.

The Foundation has been in contact with local restaurants and food producers to prepare meals and snacks to keep staff energized, and is also working with hotels which are starting to offer self-isolating rooms so staff can rest. Both initiatives are expected to ramp up to a greater extent in the coming weeks.

There is a deep sense of camaraderie at Burnaby Hospital, which is much like a community within a community. - supplied

Even though many Burnaby residents are feeling the financial strain of the economic lockdown, James says the community outpouring has touched the hearts of everyone at Burnaby Hospital.

“Our call volume has been through the roof,” she says. “We’re overwhelmed with the generosity of the community and the outpouring of concern for our hospital staff. People want to know what they can do to help.”

One family has stepped forward with a generous gift, offering to match up to $100,000 of all donations the Foundation receives through the Emergency Response Fund. Pyarali and Gulshan Nanji, along with their four children, have long been supporters of health care initiatives—across all of Canada. Their dedication to help during the current crisis, according to the family, continues their mission of giving back in gratitude to the country that gave them refuge after fleeing Idi Amin's Uganda in 1972.

However, behind the willingness to help, for some people there is fear. People have heard and read the news about hospitals in Italy being decimated by the severity of the illness borne by a staggering number of patients. They know that doctors, nurses and hospital staff were themselves dying after getting infected by patients. As everyone in Burnaby does what they can by staying at home, they also want to know that, if they get ill, the hospital has the resources it needs. Italy is a warning bell — and everyone is listening.

James is gratified but not surprised by either the hospital staff’s reaction to the epidemic or the community’s generosity.

“Burnaby Hospital is a community within a community. There has always been a deep sense of camaraderie,” she says. “We have doctors and nurses who have been there for more than 30 years. Coming in to work to take care of their colleagues and community is important to them.”

The goal of the COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund is to raise $500,000 for urgently needed equipment. - supplied

This same sense of community extends into the various Burnaby neighbourhoods. Caring for your neighbour has always been part of the ethos of Burnaby, one of the most culturally diverse cities in Canada. There’s a history of people here rallying together in the face of adversity.

“Just seeing how all of humanity and our communities are coming together and working towards the same goal is quite inspiring,” James says.

The goal of the COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund is $500,000. Any leftover funds remaining once the crisis has passed will continue to be invested in emergency care and equipment to ensure Burnaby Hospital is even better prepared the next time something like the COVID-19 pandemic occurs.",[]

But that is just what Susan and Wendy Scott did after the death of their mother.

When her 75-year-old mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer, Susan believed that the public health care system and her family were enough of a support team to safely care for her.

But the stress created by the daily concerns around her mother’s care as her quality of life diminished was compounded by Susan’s 75-year-old father’s simultaneously deteriorating health.

For the elderly couple’s dedicated but busy adult children, it was clear that their efforts and the stretched public health care services were not enough.

“It was too much for our family despite our best efforts,” Susan recalls. “I couldn’t enjoy being with my mom in the precious short time she had left because there always seemed to be a crisis and us trying to arrange outside help.”

Recognizing that their family situation was not unique, Susan became determined to help other families avoid the same support challenges.

So, together with her sister-in-law Wendy Scott a longtime registered nurse, she decided to purchase the Nurse Next Door franchise in Burnaby in 2009.

Today the private-pay home care support service has manyclients ranging in age from 20 to 100 who live in Burnaby, New Westminster, and Port Moody. Health care and support can be provided 24 hours a day by staff ranging that includes everyone from care aides to nurses.

The goal of Nurse Next Door is to help people age in place for as long as it is safe. Nurse Next Door will support clients who live in their own homes, in assisted living, in long-term care or are in hospital.

“Like me, when my mom was ill, clients and their families or close friends are willing to pay for the peace of mind that comes when you do all you can to help your loved one have a more comfortable and supported life than is offered just by limited public health care,” Susan explains.

Nurse Next Door services can be as minimal as light housekeeping and meal preparation to around-the-clock care. The client can decide the number of hours, what time of day and the days of the week that suit them.

“They tell us when they want to start. So, if they want us to start that night, we can. Or if they want us to start in a month, they can,” says Wendy.

Susan adds, “Caregiving requires constant attention including personal care that is difficult for family members to provide to loved ones. That’s where Nurse Next Door support steps in.”

Wendy points out that Nurse Next Door’s complimentary support to public health care can make the difference for a client being able to stay in their own home in their community rather than having to move to a care facility.

She says the options available with public health care are mainly focused on medical rather than other things that facilitate overall wellbeing like housekeeping, grocery shopping and companionship.

Other Nurse Next Door services include meal planning and preparation, arranging transportation, laundry service, as well as staff assisting with tasks such as light gardening and social events by accompanying clients to car shows, hockey games or community centres.

And though the majority of clients are people coping with issues associated with aging, Nurse Next Door services support clients across the health spectrum including those in need of respite, palliative and end-of-life care. Nurses, though not counsellors, are all trained in bereavement support.

Nurse Next Door also provides a full range of medical care including post-op care, wound care, and IV Therapy.

New clients are evaluated through in-person assessments as to what supports they need or could benefit from, and what can be provided to help clients do things they enjoy. As clients’ needs change over time, so can the types of support provided.

Happier Aging is the mandate of Nurse Next Door.",[]

Dated kitchen? Not sure where to start when it comes to renovating? This New Westminster construction company can help transform your space into the home of your dreams.

Magnum Construction Services is a full general contracting business, specializing in kitchen, bathroom and business renovations crafted with care by friendly, creative, passionate and reliable skilled trades people.

“We’re definitely the go-to one stop shop,” says Yosef Pharaon, site supervisor for Magnum. “From inside to outside, we can make your renovation dreams come true.”

Established in 2017, the company has already gained recognition for its quality work and excellent customer service. Magnum was recently named as a top five finalist in the2020 Small Business BC Awards.

“It was great to be nominated, especially in such a short time after being established,” Pharaon says.

Pharaon says that Magnum’s excellent client communication is what sets their business apart.

“It comes down to the fact that we are really good communicators and we are very responsive to our clients needs,” Pharaon says. “We are really interested in the relationship with clients, and building relationships is our strong point.”

Part of maintaining that strong relationship is respect for their clients’ time. When Magnum says they will start at 9 a.m., they’re knocking on the client’s door at 8:55 a.m. Magnum also tries to do as much advance work as possible to minimize the actual time on site. Clients don’t have to worry about enduring a drawn-out construction zone.

“Once we get a job, we execute as much as possible in advance to cut down on construction time,” Pharaon says. “We’ve been able to shave weeks off jobs that way.”

Magnum Constructions Services’ commitment to quality is a cornerstone of its business. They pledge to only work with the best materials available and provide a one-year guarantee on all labor. They also never compromise quality for rushing a job.

“We give our clients realistic schedules that accommodate their lives,” Pharaon says. “We strive for honest customer service, so contracts are only paid in full when the finished work is to our clients’ complete satisfaction.”

Pharaon has been in the construction and renovation business since 2006. He was drawn to the industry after growing up around renovations, assisting his father with fixing up investment properties.

“My dad bought and sold over a dozen homes and I was helping him,” Pharaon says. “He was the kind of dad who taught by trial and error. I learned a lot of things that way. My Dad’s interest in home improvement was the catalyst for me to get into the business.”

While the thought of taking on a renovation project can be intimidating for those who have never experienced it before, Magnum helps guide clients through the process in an approachable, transparent way.

“When I see clients who are really new at this and they don’t have experience in the renovations industry, I always keep it low level so I can explain using language that is approachable,” Pharaon says. “It helps to keep them at ease and keep it light.”

Not sure where to start with a renovation? For those who know they want to fix up a space in their home, but aren’t sure what they want or what that may look like, Magnum also offers access to designers who can map out exactly what an update could look like and works with clients to get the vision right.

They also offer options for what can be accomplished and work to all budgets.

Indeed, the women of the B.C. craft beer industry remind us of that every day. All around the province, they are taking part in charity brew days to mark International Women’s Day to honour and champion not only women in industry, but all women. Who wouldn’t drink to that?

For the third year, I’ve had the privilege of participating in the planning and brewing process of an all-female collaboration at New Westminster’s Steel & Oak Brewing, which benefits a local charity that supports and empowers women. This year, we’ve chosen to support the Elizabeth Fry Society of Greater Vancouver with a beer to be launched on International Women’s Day on March 8.

It’s heartening to learn that this is only one of many collaborations happening across B.C., championed by the women of the industry who are connecting to create something meaningful that not only helps us support each other, but also gives back to our communities through charitable initiatives.

Lundy Dale is the Vancouver Chapter Leader of the Pink Boots Society, an organization that aims to assist, inspire and encourage female beer industry professionals to advance their careers through education. Since the first brew five years ago at Dogwood Brewing, she has been instrumental in bringing together B.C. women from throughout the industry to collaborate and network.

“We want to make it bigger and better every year and get more women involved,” she says. “I’ve had a chance to connect and meet so many women: everyone from tasting room mangers to reps, to people who sell malt, sell hops. So it’s not just brewers, it’s women in the industry that all get together.”

Each year, a specific Pink Boots hop blend is created by members and scaled up and distributed through Yakima Chief Hops. A portion of the proceeds from all Pink Boots sales goes towards educational scholarships and programming. The host brewery then decides on a style with the help and creativity of the women involved.

Dale has relocated to Penticton, where Slackwater Brewing will be host a brew on International Women’s Day with up to 15 women, including Rebecca Kneen from Crannóg Ales and Shirley Warne from Angry Hen. Similar brews are happening all over the province.

Callister Brewing co-founder Diana McKenzie was the recipient of a Pink Boots scholarship and has been involved with the society ever since.

“I was lucky enough to earn one of their scholarships to do a tour of Germany about a year and a half ago,” she says. “So as a result of that I’ve done official Pink Boots brews the last two years to try to pay back and try and support them and their mandate.”

In conjunction with hosting a Pink Boots brew day, McKenzie is expanding on the spirit of the two by hosting female led brews year round. “We do a little pilot batch or something to be more inclusive and invite home brewers and other women to help take the mystique out of brewing and get more women involved and encourage more of that culture. I’m doing a lot of women’s brews and events all the time.”

Her goal is to have a series of Callister Women’s Collaborations each month of 2020, starting with a lichtenhainer, a traditional German smoked sour wheat ale, with Roxanne Cartwright from The Bakery Brewing Co. in January.

These brews also serve to raise the profile of women’s roles in the industry. There are women brewers, women owners, women marketers, women working in the tasting room, hell — we even write about beer.

“There’s perceptions out there and, hopefully, by more women making themselves known, we can kind of make it a bit more of an inclusive industry,” McKenzie says.

Penticton has a long-standing craft beer community, with trails blazed for women in industry by people like Cannery’s Patt Dyck and Tin Whistle’s Lorraine Nagy.

“They were women in craft beer before the conversation even started,” says Kim Lawton, marketing director of Penticton’s Cannery Brewing. “They’re such incredible icons and mentors for what we have as women in Penticton craft beer. I don’t feel like I ever had to push the boundaries the way that other people do in other areas because we have such incredible trailblazers. I just feel so blessed to be in an industry that has those women legends ahead of us.”

The women of Cannery are collaborating on the second in their Goddess series for Pink Boots this year.

“We wanted to really do a beer that was celebration of women, by women,” she says. “All of the breweries that are supporting this are helping to create a future for more women in this industry. It’s pretty exciting to know that money is being allocated to help women grow their careers in this industry.”

No, I’m not going to give you a history lesson. I just wanted to remind people of the timeless quality of this kind of dessert.

That’s what I love so much about Glenburn Soda Fountain – they don’t try and reinvent the classics like some other dessert places. They dive into history, whether it’s the retro counters, white paper hats or the music that’s played.

They haven’t reinvented the ice cream sundae either – they have just perfected it.

Glenburn, on Hastings at Gilmore in Burnaby Heights, offers small, medium and insane sizes of sundaes. You get to choose the type of ice cream from a long list of flavours. You get to choose the type of ooey-gooey sauce on the top.

I usually go for cookies and cream ice cream because it’s rich and delicious and loaded with bits of cookies (my other go-to choice is mint chocolate). Then I either get peanut butter or chocolate fudge sauce.

Glenburn also loads it up with a heaping serving of whipped cream, chopped nuts and a cherry on top. I skip the nuts out of person preference.

There’s nothing quite like listening to Frank Sinatra on the speakers while devouring an ice-cold sundae that slowly melts. I know you might laugh about the ice cold part, but some place serve ice cream that’s already melting, especially in their shakes.

Glenburn gets it right and offers regular special concoctions in case you want to mix things up.

These will most undoubtedly include items such as green tinted beverages like beer and milkshakes for example. Although this may be an amusing way to recognize St. Patrick, the Patron Saint of Ireland, a culinary adventure of Irish cuisine would be more nostalgic, in my opinion.

There are a number of traditional Irish dishes that one can prepare to make the dinner table a celebratory venue in recognition of St. Patrick’s Day. Potatoes continue to be a staple in Irish cuisine, but there are many dishes, with or without potatoes, which capture the essence of their time-honoured meals.

Dublin Coddle is a recipe that first comes to mind when thinking about Irish food. It is a dish that consists of pan-frying sausages, bacon, onions, & garlic before placing them on potatoes slices in a casserole dish and baking together with some broth and seasonings. The seasonings can be as simple as using some dried sage with salt and pepper.

Colcannon is a very traditional vegetarian dish consisting of a mashed combination of potatoes with cabbage. The potatoes are cooked and mashed while the cabbage is pan-fried with butter and onions before being combined with the mashed potatoes with some milk or cream and seasoned to taste.

Soda Bread is a common accompaniment to many meals. It is a simple quick bread that rises with the chemical combination reaction of buttermilk with baking soda. There are many varieties of this recipe and my favorite includes the addition of wheat germ. The classic shape of this bread is round with the surface scored with a knife four times in star shaped pattern.

Lamb and Beef Stews are also very popular as one-dish meals in Ireland. Many also can include the addition of Guinness beer - a delicious black stout from Dublin.

A classic sweet with a cup of tea would be Irish Tea Brack. It is similar to a fruit cake but made without butter or margarine, and has no candied fruit. Raisins and lemon rind usually grace this heavy cake along with Irish whiskey, and warm spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.

This is just a small sample of traditional Irish fare. The Internet and the local library will prove to be valuable resources to elaborate on these ideas and make this St. Patircks Day a mealtime celebration. Also, most of these recipes are included in my ‘best of’ cookbook: The Best In Your Kitchen, available online at chefdez.com or Amazon.



Dear Chef Dez:

A Scottish friend of mine, use to talk about a dish called “Rumbledethumps”. Do you know what this is? How do you make it?

Rebecca L.

Burnaby, BC



Dear Rebecca:

Through some investigation, I have determined that “Rumbledethumps” is a Scottish dish that is almost identical to the Irish dish “Colcannon”. It is a mixture of pan-fried cabbage with white onion stirred into mashed potatoes. The difference is that Rumbledethumps is baked with the inclusion of grated cheddar cheese mixed in and melted on top of the dish.

Wendy's revealed Feb. 27 that it now has a plant-based burger on its menu called the Plantiful, featuring a patty developed in-house for its Canadian restaurants.

Following a trail blazed by fast food rivals such as A&W, which brought Beyond Meat burgers on board nearly two years ago, Wendy's is among many in its class to seek out alternatives to offer clientele who are rapidly decreasing their meat consumption. While A&W's adoption of the Beyond Burger can be deemed widely successful, particularly in markets such as Metro Vancouver, Tim Hortons recently announced it was pulling all of its test Beyond Meat options off its menus, nationwide.

article continues below

For the Plantiful, Wendy's has fixed its target market as flexitarians, rather than plant-based purists. A flexitarian is someone who follows a mostly vegetarian or plant-based diet, but opts to eat meat and other animal products from time to time.

It's clear, based on our followup questions to Wendy's regarding the Plantiful that the company knows it will be a stretch to get strict plant-based eaters to order up its new pea protein-based burger. Wendy’s acknowledges the Plantiful is first cooked on the same grill on which it prepares regular chicken menu items and, even if you opt to hold the mayo and cheese, your bun is toasted in a toaster that also toasts items made with milk.

Those who wish to scrutinize the ingredients list of the whole Plantiful package, from patty to condiments to bun, will find all of the info listed online — even the ketchup contains eggs, which further reduces your options for being wholly plant-based.

Obviously, fast food is still, by and large, junk food, but if you do a comparison of the Plantiful with its closest meaty counterpart at Wendy's, the Dave's Single Cheeseburger, the meat-free option has fewer calories, less fat and more fibre, while the cheeseburger has more protein.

The Plantiful: 470 Calories, 4g Fiber, 22g Protein, 23g Fat

Dave's Single: 580 Calories, 2g Fiber, 30g Protein , 34g Fat

But perhaps most shockingly: Wendy's Plantiful patty is round. Talk about one quick way to answer the infamous Wendy's query ""Where's the beef?""

Wendy's is also touting the fact that, unlike restaurants that serve Beyond Meat, Wendy’s came up with its own recipe. However, a rep for Wendy's did note that the company worked ""alongside an established Canadian supplier"" to come up with their Plantiful recipe.





One last caveat: As of right now, while you should be able to order the Plantiful at your local Wendy's, it might not be a forever thing.

""The Plantiful is being featured across Canada for a limited time,"" a rep for Wendy's told V.I.A. via email.

Ian Robb says over 90 per cent of hospitality employees in the country's hotels, airports, stadiums, universities and schools haven't worked since March.

He says too few employers are using the federal wage subsidy program to keep workers tied to their jobs and all levels of government need to work creatively to avoid long-term unemployment in the sector.

The union wants governments and employers to ensure their jobs are protected, that there is a safe way back to work and that there is income support for the duration of the crisis.

The truck flipped onto its side and skidded down the highway before striking the five other vehicles travelling eastbound.

The fiscal and economic report released a week ago detailed the Liberals' financial expectations, including a $343.2-billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

Parliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux says in a report that there are other numbers behind the biggest ones that MPs and senators should question.

He points to projections that enterprise Crown corporations, such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. and Business Development Bank of Canada, will collectively lose $12 billion this fiscal year.

Giroux notes that loss is a sharp turnaround from the $7.3 billion in gains for the 12-month period ending in March.

He says losses are unusual for these Crown corporations and adds that each should provide detailed projections to Parliament as soon as possible about its COVID-19 liquidity programs.

Similarly, Giroux says the Liberals should provide details of their own borrowing, which his office estimates will exceed by $150 billion the ceiling set by federal legislation.

The budget office estimates the government's planned debt issuance this fiscal year of $713 billion will cost $2.2 billion annually in interest.

The report released Thursday also notes $4.4 billion in spending for measures the government has yet to announce.

All the spending is expected to push the federal debt past the $1-trillion mark.

The Liberals had previously made a declining debt-to-GDP ratio key to their fiscal plans, but skyrocketing spending will push the ratio to 49 per cent from 31.1 per cent.

Giroux says fiscal transparency and accountability would be enhanced if the Liberals identify their new ""fiscal anchor,"" how they'll measure their own successful handling of the budget and national economy, which wasn't specifically laid out in the update last week.

He said the federal government will contribute $19 billion under the ""Safe Restart Agreement.""

article continues below

The money is to help the lower-tier governments with needs such as funding child care, bailing out cities whose expenses have soared and revenues plunged, increasing contact-tracing capacity, and buying personal protective equipment.

Trudeau had promised $14 billion in early June, but several premiers resisted some of the conditions the federal Liberals wanted to put on the money and said it wasn't enough.

Ontario's Doug Ford was one who didn't like a federal demand that some of it fund up to 10 days of paid sick leave to discourage workers with precarious employment from going into work ill. Quebec's Francois Legault wanted the money to be transferred without conditions so provinces could use it on whatever they considered most important.

Trudeau said the agreement outlines seven priority areas, with some flexibility for the provinces to apply the money to their particular needs over the next six to eight months.

""The provinces agreed to invest in the targeted sectors,"" Trudeau said. ""There are areas like support for vulnerable people where we will expect the provinces to declare publicly what they will do.""

At his side, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland added the agreement includes standards in certain areas, such as COVID-19 testing, in exchange for the federal money.

The pandemic is a health crisis, but Trudeau said it has a deep economic dimension that the funding is intended to address.

He said workers can't work if their children don't have safe care, and many can't get to their jobs if they don't have access to safe transit systems.

That means funding public services better so they don't have to rely on crowding many people into small spaces for their finances to make sense.

Municipal governments, which deliver many of those services, have been warning for months that their finances are careening toward brick walls and have been begging for aid.

Canada's largest city, Toronto, has reported that it's facing a $1.35-billion deficit this year. Montreal says it has a $500-million shortfall. Halifax expects to be short $85.4 million.

""The ruin of the First Nations and peoples of Canada is not just statistics. As seen here, it is real pain,"" Justice Chris Martin said in a written decision delivered July 10.

article continues below

Anthony McKay was sentenced to four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the death of his mother, Shirley McKay. He faces two years behind bars, after receiving credit for time already served, and will be subject to three years of supervised probation after that.

""As a human, Mrs. McKay deserved better. And, like anyone born in this bountiful country, her son, her killer, deserved a better start, a better chance, in life,"" Martin wrote.

The judge said the killing on the Berens River First Nation, about 300 kilometres north of Winnipeg, was a ""calamity of almost 150 years of government policy, actions and inactions affecting the Indigenous community.""

Anthony McKay, who was 21 at the time, went to his mother's home after a night of drinking on June 22, 2018.

Court was told there was blood everywhere when a cousin came over about 8 a.m. The cousin found Shirley McKay unconscious and badly beaten. Her son has said he doesn't know why he viciously beat her.

The woman was taken to a nursing station before being transported to a hospital in Winnipeg. Her son visited her in hospital daily and was overheard at her bedside sobbing and apologizing.

Court heard he was confronted by a stepbrother and admitted that he had hurt his mother.

Shirley McKay died that September. Her son was arrested the following month.

""She did not recover and died months later, another victim in a mass of slain Aboriginal women,"" Martin said. ""He pled guilty to manslaughter, joining an appalling line of young Aboriginals ending up in prison.""

Crown prosecutors were asking for a seven-year sentence in a federal penitentiary. The defence asked for two years behind bars plus the probation so that McKay could have access to programming available in provincial custody.

The judge pointed to impacts of colonization, the pass system which restricted Indigenous Peoples' movement, residential schools and the '60s Scoop in his sentencing.

""It is well accepted that the government's role, since the early days of dealing with First Nations peoples, has had the effect of isolating, infantilizing, marginalizing, and traumatizing Indigenous societies like the Ojibwa (or Anishinaabe) of Berens River,"" Martin wrote.

""Mr. McKay is a person shaped by a system historically designed to 'take the Indian out of the Indian.'""

Reports provided to the judge on McKay's background said he has partial fetal alcohol syndrome.

One of 13 siblings, he spent most of his time in foster homes on the First Nation or more often in Winnipeg. His parents struggled with alcohol and sniffing substances, and McKay followed a similar path starting when he was 13. His father died in 2010.

McKay was neglected and not cared for, files from child and family services said. He asked to become a permanent ward of child welfare in 2013 because he didn't feel safe with his family.

Martin said McKay's troubled upbringing doesn't excuse his behaviour, but does help explain why he is who he is.

Occasionally it is incumbent on a judge to underscore systemic issues, he said, adding Indigenous people are disproportionately affected by serious crime and disproportionately incarcerated.

""Like so many other cases, this case is troubling, not only for its specific facts, but because it reminds that core issues affecting many in the Indigenous population are not really being addressed sufficiently or urgently enough,"" Martin wrote.

""Many in this and the next generation of Indigenous people are at risk.""

The ruse discovered Wednesday included bogus tweets from Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Celebrities Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, were also hacked.

Hackers used social engineering to target some of Twitter’s employees and then gained access to the high-profile accounts. The attackers sent out tweets from the accounts of the public figures, offering to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address.

Cybersecurity experts say such a breach could have dire consequences since the attackers were tweeting from verified, globally influential accounts with millions of followers.

""If you receive a tweet from a verified account, belonging to a well-known and therefore trusted person, you can no longer assume it’s really from them,"" said Michael Gazeley, managing director of cybersecurity firm Network Box.

Reacting to the breach, Twitter swiftly deleted the tweets and locked down the accounts to investigate. In the process it prevented verified users from sending out tweets for several hours.

The company said Thursday it has taken ""significant steps to limit access to internal systems and tools.""

Many celebrities, politicians and business leaders often use Twitter as a public platform to make statements. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, regularly uses Twitter to post about national and geopolitical matters, and his account is closely followed by media, analysts and governments around the world.

Twitter faces an uphill battle in regaining people’s confidence, Gazeley said. For a start, it needs to figure out exactly the accounts were hacked and show the vulnerabilities have been fixed, he said.

""If key employees at Twitter were tricked, that’s actually a serious cybersecurity problem in itself,"" he said. ""How can one of the world’s most used social media platforms have such weak security, from a human perspective?""

Rachel Tobac, CEO of Socialproof Security, said that the breach appeared to be largely financially motivated. But such an attack could cause more serious consequences.

""Can you imagine if they had taken over a world leader’s account, and tweeted out a threat of violence to another country’s leader?"" asked Tobac, a social engineering hacker who specializes in providing training for companies to protect themselves from such breaches.

Social engineering attacks typically target human weaknesses to exploit networks and online platforms. Companies can guard themselves against such attacks by beefing up multi-factor authentication -– where users have to present multiple pieces of evidence as authentication before being allowed to log into a system, Tobac said.

Such a process could include having a physical token that an employee must have with them, on top of a password, before they can log into a corporate or other private system. Other methods include installing technical tools to monitor for suspicious insider activities and reducing the number of people who have access to an administrative panel, Tobac said.

Several U.S. lawmakers called on Twitter to co-operate with authorities including the Department of Justice and the FBI to secure the site.

""I am concerned that this event may represent not merely a co-ordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.

He added that millions of users relied on Twitter not just to send tweets but also communicate privately via direct messaging. Twitter hasn't said if hackers were able to access the private messages of their high-profile targets.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told him in a private conversation in 2018 that the company was working on protecting direct messages, known as DMs, with end-to-end encryption.

But that promise never materialized, Wyden said Thursday, leaving everyone's private messages ""vulnerable to employees who abuse their internal access to the company’s systems, and hackers who gain unauthorized access.""

""This is a vulnerability that has lasted for far too long, and one that is not present in other, competing platforms,"" Wyden said in an emailed statement. ""If hackers gained access to users’ DMs, this breach could have a breathtaking impact, for years to come.""

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

Bangladesh has reopened businesses including its main export-earning garment sector after a monthslong closure.",[]

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

article continues below

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

""My hope is that this series can be a place to explore meaningful topics together and sort through so many of the questions we’re all trying to answer in our own lives,"" Obama said in a statement.

The new podcast is the first title in the ongoing collaboration between Spotify and Higher Ground, a production company founded by Barack and Michelle Obama. Last year, the former president and first lady partnered with Spotify to produce exclusive podcasts for the platform.

Michelle Obama’s new podcast expects to hold candid and personal conversations with a focus on topics concerning relationships and health. She expects to have several guests on the series including talk-show host Conan O’Brien and Valerie Jarrett, business woman and former senior advisor to Barack Obama.

""Perhaps most of all, I hope this podcast will help listeners open up new conversations — and hard conversations —- with the people who matter most to them,"" she said. ""That’s how we can build more understanding and empathy for one another.""

Obama released her Netflix documentary ""Becoming"" in May. The project was an extension of her 2018 bestselling memoir of the same name and a kind of authorized filmic portrait of Obama.

In an email to workers Wednesday night, the company said that since January it has had fewer than 10 cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 that were transmitted in the workplace.

article continues below

But the email from Laurie Shelby, Tesla’s vice-president of environmental, safety and health, also confirmed reports that Tesla is looking into more than 130 positive tests among employees, including those who contracted the virus outside of Tesla facilities. She said less than 0.25% of employees worldwide have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which equals just over 137 workers.

Her message came in response to a report by Electrek.co that over 130 Tesla employees or contractors have tested positive, and hundreds more are waiting for test results. The website said it based the report on internal company data.

Shelby wrote that the story referred to data ""that was in the process of being validated"" and included employees worldwide who may have been infected but never entered a Tesla site, or were infected at home while Tesla's operations were shut down earlier in the year. A Tesla spokesman would not comment on the report or the email, which was obtained by The Associated Press.

""Nearly all — more than 99.99% — of these occurrences were not cases of virus transmitted at work,"" Shelby wrote in the email. ""Most of the positive cases resulted from an individual living with or travelling with someone with COVID-19 and have returned to work after recovering from home.""

Shelby wrote that Tesla doesn't have any employees in serious condition anywhere in the world because of COVID-19.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the numbers from the public health department in Alameda County, California, which includes Fremont, the location of Tesla's only U.S. assembly plant. The factory employs about 10,000 workers.

Some workers have refused to return to the plant out of fear of catching the virus. They did so after CEO Elon Musk in May defied Health Department orders not to restart production under shutdown orders due to the virus.

Some Tesla workers and labour activists say the company is threatening to fire employees who haven’t returned, but Tesla officials have said claims about firings are not true. Workers say they've heard about COVID-19 cases at the plant but they don't know numbers. They have called on the company and health department to release the figures.

However, Shelby wrote in the email that an employee survey found the vast majority of workers feel comfortable with the safety measures being taken by the company.

Among the measures are increased cleaning, limiting access to facilities, temperature checks for employees before they enter buildings, staggered shifts to keep workers apart, additional barriers between employees and providing protective equipment, Shelby wrote.

She urged workers to wear masks or face coverings to stay healthy and save lives and warned that failing to wear masks where required, or not wearing them properly, will bring disciplinary actions. She also wrote that workers should stay home if they're sick.

Musk reopened the Fremont plant May 11 in defiance of county orders. The health department had deemed the factory a nonessential business that can’t fully open under virus restrictions, but Tesla contended it was essential under federal guidelines.

The next day, however, the Health Department announced that the plant could return to manufacturing as long as it delivers on worker safety precautions that it agreed to.",[]

Asa Hutchinson issued an order Thursday requiring people to wear face masks in public throughout the state, which has had a surge in coronavirus cases over the past several weeks.

The Republican governor had resisted a statewide mask mandate and opposed issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the pandemic, but he signed the order requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible in the hopes of slowing the disease's rapid spread in the state. The order takes effect Monday.

article continues below

Hutchinson’s decision comes amid growing support for mask requirements from business and health leaders and a day after Bentonville-based Walmart said it would require customers to wear masks in all of its U.S. stores. The state’s largest newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, also called for a statewide requirement on Thursday.

Hutchinson previously encouraged people to wear masks and allowed cities to pass ordinances requiring their use, but he stopped short of requiring them statewide. He’s the latest Republican governor to relent on the mask issue in the face of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Alabama's governor issued a similar mask mandate on Wednesday.

Arkansas' coronavirus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen despite warnings from national health officials about the risks of doing so too soon. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that did not issue a broader stay-at-home order that kept most businesses closed.

Hutchinson previously questioned how a mask mandate could be enforced in a rural state such as Arkansas, but this week he left open the possibility of such a requirement. The chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences called for a statewide requirement last weekend.

Hutchinson's order was expected to face criticism from some conservatives in the state. Hours before he issued the order, a Republican legislator urged people to call Hutchinson to oppose any mask directive.

A poll by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business suggested tensions are flaring between workers and employers, with around 27 per cent of 3,389 employers polled indicating some of their laid-off staff have refused to return to work.

article continues below

Of the nearly 870 businesses that provided the reasons their employees gave for refusing to return to work, 62 per cent reported workers ""prefer the Canada Emergency Response Benefit."" Employers could choose more than one explanation for why a worker refused to return, and respondents also selected options such as concern for health (47 per cent), childcare obligations (27 per cent) or lack of hours in return offer (16 per cent).

CFIB president Dan Kelly said it's ""clear"" that CERB ""created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality."" Other sectors where conflicts are arising include child care, dental offices, home health care, amusement parks, gambling and spectator sports, the study suggested.

""CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But Ian Robb, Canadian director of the Unite Here union that represents hospitality workers, disagrees. He said workers are impatient to return to work — for what is usually the lucrative summer season — but employers are the ones failing to adopt measures like frequent cleaning and wage subsidies. The union previously estimated that average wages in cities like Toronto are around $20 per hour for hospitality.

""A number of our members in the U.S. have gone to work and contracted (COVID-19),"" Robb said.

""There's just not enough safety in front of service. Nobody wants to stay home and make two grand when they can make double that by working.""

The survey suggested that the hospitality sector had the biggest share of employers, 45 per cent, who had trouble recalling workers. CFIB defines hospitality as including hotels, restaurants and bars.

The CFIB study suggests that in the hospitality sector, 56 per cent of hard-to-fill positions were ""unskilled, entry-level jobs"" that pay ""at or around minimum wage,"" although across sectors, skilled and semi-skilled jobs were harder to fill.

Employment and human rights lawyer Neena Gupta says she has heard of tradespeople unable to perform jobs because workers failed to return.

She said the reason an employee is refusing the work matters. Lack of childcare, like daycare and camps, can be a job-protected reason for staying home, as can disabilities such as being immunocompromised, says Gupta, a partner in Gowling WLG's Waterloo Region and Toronto offices.

The federal government's website states that workers seeking CERB, which offers $500 per week over a limited period, ""should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so."" The government's COVID-19 guidelines also provide for employees to refuse to do a dangerous job, although the worker must already ""be at work"" to refuse such a task.

However, notes Gupta, general apprehension about the pandemic is likely not enough to merit a job refusal. She said workplaces must comply with health and safety guidelines, and that a ministry inspection must find some sort of violation to justify a job refusal.

Managers should give workers a written ""come back to work"" recall and an indication that it will be treated as job abandonment if the worker doesn't return, says Gupta. After that process is completed, the employer could consider that worker terminated for cause, and hire a replacement.

While reporting misuse of CERB by a former employee might appear to give an employer some moral satisfaction, Gupta says it’s unlikely to help with staffing concerns or worker morale.

""I do ask people to be reasonable. You can’t call someone at noon on a Thursday and expect them in at 7 a.m. on Friday,"" she says.

A cracked bone? Good to go. What about a sore shoulder? No problem.

It's well-known NHLers battle through aches, pains and even illness. Almost like clockwork, a flu bug tears through more than a few locker rooms every season. Players often attempt to soldier on without missing any time, especially when the games matter most.

In the era of COVID-19, however, some of that old the definition of ""toughness"" is being thrown out the window.

Players and coaches are keenly aware that if they're feeling even the slightest bit off — and there are a laundry list of symptoms associated with the novel coronavirus, from chills to headaches to fatigue and weakness — it needs to be reported immediately.

""Doesn't matter if you're a tough hockey player or not,"" said Tippett, now the head coach of the Edmonton Oilers. ""I had a lot of games where I hid a broken finger or something like that from doctors. I didn't want them to know because they wouldn't let me play.

""But when you get sick, you're going to have to tell people. That's just the way of the new world.""

The NHL opened training camps this week as part of its plan to kickstart a campaign that was suspended in mid-March by the pandemic. Players and staff are getting tested every 48 hours — they're not currently quarantined — and that will be kick up another notch to once a day when the 24 teams involved in the resumption head to the hub cities of Edmonton and Toronto, where they'll be kept in a bubble separate from the general public.

Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said the mentality of the past has been turned on its head when it comes to illness.

""As hockey players you want to be in every single game, you want to play, and you want to help your teammate, and you want to be a difference-maker,"" he said. ""Before you played through colds, you played through injuries, you played through sickness and stuff like that.

""You have to step back and think a little bit now. It's a different animal, this virus. You have to be not only cautious of yourself and how you're feeling, but the people around you, too. It's not just your teammates, it's the medical staff, it's the trainers, it's everybody you're around every single day, and even obviously opposing teams. You've got to think of everybody. You've got to be very cautious.""

Edmonton Oilers centre and NHL leading scorer Leon Draisaitl said that caution is going to become the new norm.

""Every hockey player has played through certain things and we've all played through a flu or sickness or whatever it is,"" he said. ""But now with this going around, it makes it a little more dangerous.

""You have to be careful.""

Winnipeg Jets centre Andrew Copp said hockey's team-first mentality should kick in if someone isn't feeling right.

""You hope that everyone's pretty dialled in, and not only for everyone's health and safety, but for the team too,"" he said. ""If this guy gets it, he's not playing. Hopefully everyone can realize that we're all making a lot of sacrifices here.""

The NHL hasn't said how many positive tests would constitute the ""uncontrolled outbreak"" listed in its return-to-play protocol that could conceivably shut the league's resumption down. There's a difference between cases being spread out and a cluster of infections on a team or teams.

The league said earlier this week 30 players tested positive for COVID-19 during voluntary workouts at team facilities between June 8 and July 12. Another 13 positive results came outside of the league's protocol, while 10 other players tested positive in the spring. Training camps opened Monday, but individuals and teams won't be named moving forward with regards to positive tests.

It's no secret players have hid countless injuries in the past, and the league has been criticized heavily for how it dealt with the concussion issue, but Mathieu Schneider, special assistant to NHLPA executive director Don Fehr, said the virus is different territory.

""If concussions were contagious, I think players would feel differently about it,"" Schneider said. ""Guys certainly understand the notion that if they are not honest with symptoms or how they might feel, that they put their entire team in jeopardy.

""There's going to be a huge onus on the players here in (training camp) to make sure that they're taking care of themselves and looking out for their teammates — going to the rink, going home, going to the grocery store, social distancing, wearing mask, washing your hands. All the things that all of us are practising every single day now.""

Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly said it simply comes down to common sense is in this new reality.

""It's on the players and our staff to be honest with each other,"" he said. ""You don't want to put anyone else at risk.

""You want to do what's best for them.""

Ryan entered the NHL/NHLPA Players' Assistance program on Nov. 20 to get help for alcohol addiction. After going public with his story in an effort to help others with addiction issues, an emotional Ryan returned to the ice Feb. 27 and scored three times in a 5-2 win over visiting Vancouver.

Lindblom was diagnosed in December with Ewing's sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that grows in the bones or in the tissue around bones. He completed radiation treatments on July 2.

The rising star had 11 goals and 18 points in 30 games this season. While he has recently skated at the Flyers' complex in Voorhees, New Jersey, he has been ruled out of playing when the NHL season resumes.

Johns missed all of last season and the first 47 games of this one with painful headaches due to post-concussion syndrome. He scored four games into his return on Feb. 3 against the Rangers, with his parents in attendance at Madison Square Garden.

The 18-year veteran quarterback headlines the Canadian Football Hall of Fame's 2020 class that was unveiled Thursday. Burris, 45, got the nod in his first year of eligibility, becoming just the 21st player ever to do so but second in as many years after Calgary running back Jon Cornish in 2019.

article continues below

Joining Burris in the player category are offensive linemen Clyde Brock and Freddie Childress and quarterback Greg Vavra. John Hufnagel, the Calgary Stampeders president/GM, and Larry Uteck (posthumously), the former head coach/athletic director at Saint Mary’s University, were both named as builders.

Burris's family — wife Nicole and sons Armand and Barron — had known of his induction since February but managed to keep quiet about it until about two and a half weeks ago when the Hall of Fame informed Burris. Even then, the Burris clan was very nonchalant in asking the former quarterback to take in what he thought was a run-of-the-mill video.

Instead, Burris watched Hall of Famer Damon Allen (2012) outline his pro football journey to Canada, which drew a rather bewildered look from Burris. Then Allen detailed Burris's stellar CFL career before Mark DeNobile, the Hall of Fame's executive director, delivered the big news.

And the player, affectionately dubbed Smilin' Hank because of his outgoing personality, was lost for words as tears streamed down his face.

""Yeah, they got me good,"" Burris said with a chuckle. ""What's funny is whenever I've told the boys to keep anything quiet, they've always gone back to their mother and yet they didn't say a peep about this.

""I was lost for words just because to hear it shows you that people appreciated the things you did throughout your career. This is the way for the league and all the organizations and the fans saying, 'Thank you,' and for me I'm humbled by it . . . there's so many guys in there (Hall of Fame) who I looked up to and now to be able to join them is a dream come true.""

The six-foot-one, 190-pound Burris, a native of Spiro, Okla., played 20 pro seasons, 18 in the CFL with the Calgary Stampeders (1997-99, 2005-11), Saskatchewan Roughriders (2000, 2003-04), Hamilton Tiger-Cats (2012-13) and Ottawa Redblacks (2014-16). Burris also spent time with the NFL's Green Bay Packers (2001) and Chicago Bears (2002).

Burris appeared in five Grey Cups, winning three (1998, '08, '16) and being named the MVP twice (2008, '16). The CFL's outstanding player on two occasions (2010, 2015), Burris amassed 63,639 passing yards and 373 TD passes — both third all-time.

Burris retired shortly after leading Ottawa to a thrilling 39-33 overtime Grey Cup upset win over Calgary. He threw for 461 yards and three TDs despite suffering a knee injury during warmups.

Burris said his Hall of Fame induction is as much a testament to his family's resilience and perseverance as it is his on-field accomplishments.

""I had to take my wife all over Canada, drag my kids all over Canada and force them to make new friends just for dad to be able to play this game called football,"" said Burris, whose family still calls Ottawa home. ""And for them to understand and see just the emotions that ran through me . . . it just shows how big that moment is, just kind of when your whole life flashes before you.""

Burris and the other inductees will have to wait for their day in the sun due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 class will be honoured alongside the 2021 inductees next August.

When Burris is formally honoured, he'll be joined by former teammate Childress and Hufnagel, who served as Calgary's head coach (2008-2015) before moving into the front office full-time. Burris won Grey Cups with both ('98 with Childress, '08 with Hufnagel).

""Calgary is a machine right now and it all started in 2008 when Huf came in and we got that Grey Cup in his first year,"" Burris said. ""Calgary has always had double-digit wins and been in the playoffs each and every year Huf has been there, they've always been a strong contender for the Grey Cup and there's one reason why.""

Hufnagel, a 68-year-old native of Coraopolis, Pa., spent 12 seasons as a CFL quarterback with Calgary (1976-79), Saskatchewan (1980-83, 1987) and Winnipeg (1984-86) before getting into coaching. A five-time Grey Cup champion, Hufnagel also earned a Super Bowl ring as an assistant with the New England Patriots (2003).

Hufnagel amassed a 102-42-1 record as Calgary's head coach, his .712 win percentage being the highest among coaches with more than 100 games. He's been named the CFL's coach of the year twice (2008, 2014).

Childress, a 53-year-old native of Little Rock, Ark., played 13 CFL seasons with Shreveport (1994), Birmingham (1995), Calgary (1996-03) and Saskatchewan (2004-06). A former second-round pick of the NFL's New England Patriots, Childress won two Grey Cups with the Stampeders (1998, 2001) and in 1998 was named the CFL's top offensive lineman.

Brock, 79, of Los Angeles, played 12 seasons with Saskatchewan (1964-75), helping the club win its first Grey Cup in 1966. The former Dallas Cowboy-San Francisco 49er appeared in 169 regular-season CFL games and four times was named a league all-star before being inducted into Saskatchewan's Plaza of Honour in 1995.

Vavra, 59, of Red Deer, Alta., helped the Calgary Dinos win the Vanier Cup in 1983, his final season at the school. That year, he also became the first player in the program's history to capture the Hec Crighton Trophy as Canadian university football's top player and still holds the U Sports record for most passing yards in a game (627).

Vavra was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in 1984 and also spent time with the B.C. Lions (1986-87) and Edmonton Eskimos (1988).

After playing seven CFL seasons as a defensive back with Toronto (1974-76), B.C. (1977), Montreal (1978-80) and Ottawa (1980), Uteck became an assistant coach at Saint Mary’s University in 1982. He was promoted to head coach the following year, a position he held until 1997.

Over that span, Uteck was named the Atlantic University Athletic Association coach of the year five times and twice Canadian university football's top coach.

Uteck served as athletic director from 1995 to 2002 and the Huskies captured two Vanier Cups (2001-02). The native of Thornhill, Ont., passed away Dec. 25, 2002 of Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 50.

The Atlantic Bowl was renamed the Uteck Bowl in 2003.

The metaphor suggested by the title of Christian Sands’ new album is apt.

article continues below

The jazz pianist says he was trying to be freer and more flexible on ""Be Water,"" and it shows. The set's 10 cuts explore a wide range of moods and instrumental combinations, with Sands' trio at the core.

Much of the material is built on the same pattern of tension and release found in a body of water. That begins with the opening ""Intro,"" which settles on the tonic chord after nearly four minutes of shimmering undulation.

The reflective ""Still,"" featuring Marvin Sewell on acoustic guitar, rides a mere ripple of rhythm. On ""Be Water II,"" a string quartet plays against the lapping beat established by Sands' piano. Marcus Strickland's woodwind work makes ""Drive"" swing as it crests with a cascading electric guitar solo by Sewell.

Sands rarely cuts loose at the piano — his objective isn't to be splashy — but he takes an active role as the producer, overdubbing extra keyboards and including sound effects and brief recitations by martial artist Bruce Lee. ""Water can flow, or it can crash,"" Lee says. Forgive the flood of puns, but ""Be Water"" flows freely.",[]

Everything about this album is intimidating, including the growling, nether-worldly voice of singer Udo Dirkschneider, and the fact that his backing band is the official concert band of the German military. This album is not for the faint of heart.

The former Accept frontman's solo band U.D.O. teams with the Musikkorps der Bundeswehr to put some real metal in heavy metal on ""We Are One.""

The pairing has undeniable power and force on 15 tracks that deal with environmental threats to the planet (""Future Is the Reason Why"", ""Mother Earth""), the refugee crisis (""Children of the World""), and a reunited Germany (""Rebel Town""), among other topics. The band lends a sweeping grandeur to most of the tracks with horns and strings punching up already-rowdy guitar riffs.

And for those who still miss the diminutive singer's 1980s heyday with Accept, U.D.O. throws them a bone in ""We Strike Back,"" a close cousin of the classic Accept concert opener ""Fast as a Shark,"" with very similar speed, style and structure, right down to the harmonic twin guitar solos.

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro's column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday's newspaper.

article continues below

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, ""has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.""

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check story by Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro's claims.

It wasn't clear how Navarro's column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he's letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last month that an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn't been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor.

Navarro did not immediately return a message for comment.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro's opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci ""a national treasure.""

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint ""shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.""

It wasn't clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he's publicly been more pessimistic than the president. He does webcasts but rarely gives television interviews anymore.

Trump distanced himself from Navarro's column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro's views and ""he shouldn't be doing that.""

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that ""might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives."" USA Today said there isn't enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

The fact-checker also gave more context to Navarro claims about masks, the drug hydroxychloroquine and Fauci's early statements of concern about the virus.",[]

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

article continues below

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

The Minto Cup, along with all other minor and senior national championships, has also been cancelled by the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

In a release, BCJALL president Karl Christiansen said ongoing restrictions in British Columbia limiting the size of public gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic to no more than 50 people made it impossible for games to be played.

On the day Finance Minister Carol James announced a $12.5 billion deficit, the combined effect of an economic meltdown and $6.26 billion in supports to date, a polling company released details of a huge jump in approval ratings for how the B.C. government has stick-handled the pandemic.

article continues below

Meanwhile, the BC Liberals are weighing in with a hefty criticism of the government’s economic recovery plan, and trying to get their voices heard above the fray.

In a press release issued today Wednesday, Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson stated that under the BC NDP-government’s watch, the province has amassed the largest deficit in British Columbia’s modern history.

He contends that this year’s deficit has increased by 27.6%, or $2,643 for every British Columbian, while household incomes are estimated to fall by approximately 3.9% in 2020.

James, however, maintains that B.C.’s safe restart plan is “creating signs of hope for our economy as consumer confidence increases.”

Wilkinsons argues the economic recovery plan is lacking because “there will be no change in the government spending priorities” and the strategy is “simply unsustainable.”

Source: Insights West Graphic

Still, the Insights West poll suggests the government has got a lot of wriggle room in its appeal to British Columbians, noting that the BC NDP has approved its rating during the pandemic, with Premier Horgan himself ratcheting up his approval rating by 17% to 68%, “a higher level higher than for any political leader in B.C. since tracking began 8 years ago.”

Meanwhile, Insights West said its online poll — which ran from June 24-28 among 830 B.C. residents — shows opposition parties are having a difficult time catching the attention of B.C. voters.

The poll found Wilkinson’s approval rating has dropped five points since November to 30%. Interim Green leader Adam Olsen has made his debut at a 29% approval rating — the lowest of any Green leader since the 2017 election, and 44% of B.C. residents don’t know enough about him to provide a rating. Trevor Bolin from the BC Conservative Party, meanwhile, has an 18% approval rating, but similarly, 49% of British Columbians didn’t know enough about him to provide a rating.

Insights Wests notes that approval of the government’s response to the pandemic has improved its ratings overall.

For example, 85% think it has done a good job on combating COVID-19, 84% for providing info about the pandemic, 79% for phase 2 and phase 3 re-opening of the economy, and 69% for the financial support for people impacted from COVID-19.

However, a closer reading shows a dip in areas where B.C. residents are “typically more negative than positive towards the BC NDP’s handling of certain issues, such as housing and affordability, down nine points, and homelessness down 13%.",[]

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

We use whole, natural organic ingredients as well as non-medicated meats, such as free-range eggs and chicken. We believe food shouldn’t just taste good, but also make you feel good.”

The business grew out of Ken’s 25-year career in the food industry and inspiration from his own family. When heading out for a meal, he found they often wanted different types of food – some focused on a category of flavour and others seeking healthy choices.

“I think this happens often when friends or family go out together. So we came up with the idea of creating a restaurant that provides a little bit of everything most customers want. This was the inspiration that brought Foodies on Board to life.”

So far, it’s been a winning combination. In fact, the company was voted #1 caterer in Burnaby this year.

“We are a made-from-scratch kitchen,” he said. “We even make our own bacon the old-school way. It’s time consuming but there’s no added chemicals so it tastes better and is healthier for your body. We also offer a variety of dishes to meet different types of diets, such as gluten-free, vegan, keto, and paleo. We also offer freshly prepared meal plans for busy families or office workers that deliver to their house or office. The meal plans are designed to be both nutritionally balance and incredibly delicious. Our goal is to not only save you time but also make eating healthy an enjoyable experience.”

The pair opened the doors to Foodies on Board in 2017 and have been growing ever since. They’re expanding into a second bigger location in Olympic Village in 2020, as well as a franchise express location on Broadway in Vancouver in December.

The goal is to be the industry leader for fast, healthy food choices in the local community, and in corporate and special event catering, hot lunches for schools, and more.

With the reputation they’ve already built, and their focus on constant innovation and improvement, it’s not hard to imagine that Foodies on Board will be serving up excellence for a long time to come.

It can change your entire world. But fortunately, professionals such as Stuart Lloyd, the owner of Burnaby-based Lloyd Hearing Solutions, can help.

Lloyd Hearing Solutions has been serving the local community for more than 47 years now. Originally started by his father back in 1971, Stuart has fond memories of the family business and even worked Saturday shifts to help out in the store while he was growing up. So when Stuart himself qualified as a Hearing Instrument Practitioner, it was only natural that he’d make his way into the family business.

“The technology behind hearing solutions has changed a lot since the 1970s,” Stuart says. “But one thing that has remained the same for us is our commitment to caring for our customers.”

Lloyd Hearing Solutions prides itself on serving the local community with care, after all there’s a reason why they’ve been voted Best Hearing Centre for more than 15 years in a row by Burnaby Now.

“We care for our customers like they’re our own family,” Stuart says. “We have a vested interest in providing them with the products and services that will help improve their overall hearing and communication so they can get their lives back on track.”

Lloyd Hearing Solutions offers complimentary hearing testing for their customers alongside expert consultation on the latest digital hearing aid technology. They also offer products to suit all budgets and lifestyles, alongside a 60-day trial period and three-year warranty. It’s no wonder then that Burnaby has trusted them with something as precious as their hearing for almost half a century.

Gill won the million on Canada’s birthday after purchasing his ticket at the Chevron Town Pantry on 58 Avenue in Surrey.

He says when he initially checked his ticket, he wasn’t quite convinced he was a big winner.

“I checked at the self-checker,” said Gill. “I told my son, and then I had to go to another gas station to make sure it was correct. After I told my wife, they both thought I was joking and didn’t believe me.”

Gill says the $1 million means he can take a step back from work.

“It’ll be nice to not have to work so hard,” laughed Gill. “I’ll still continue to … I want to start my own business.”

On top of starting a new business, Gill will put some of his money towards the new house that he’s building, so the timing of the win is perfect.

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

What to look out for

The BBB says consumers should look out for the following red flags is they are searching for a lender or loan broker:

The health authority added the outbreak of C. difficile to its list of current outbreaks on July 14.

article continues below

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Rash

If you are visiting someone who is located on an outbreak unit, visitors may be limited to two people at a time. Fraser Health asks that you do not visit other patient rooms or common areas on the unit such as the lounge and patient kitchenette. It also recommends you don’t visit public areas in the hospital such as the cafeteria and gift shop.",[]

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

265,burnabynow,https://www.burnabynow.com/real-estate/b-c-strata-insurance-market-unhealthy-study-1.24153951,B.C. strata insurance market ‘unhealthy:’ study,['Jeremy Hainsworth'],,"Strata corporation insurance rates have jumped about 40% across B.C. since last year, with deductibles sometimes leaping to triple-digit increases, the B.C. Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) said June 16.

“The current state of the strata insurance market is unhealthy,” said authority vice-president and deputy superintendent for regulation Frank Chong.

article continues below

Minister of Finance Carole James said rising condo and apartment building costs are serious issues for thousands of British Columbians.

“This is especially true with many people facing additional financial pressure related to the COVID-19 pandemic,” she said. “We knew this was a complex issue, and now we have a clearer picture of the different local, national and global factors affecting cost and availability within the insurance market.”

Among key report findings, based on a survey of 6,000 strata and townhouse properties, are:

• an average increase of 40% year-over-year to strata insurance premiums province-wide;

• a 50% increase in Metro Vancouver;

• 54% of strata properties experienced a premium increase of less than 30% compared to premiums the previous year;

• 31% of strata properties saw increases in the 30-50 % range;

• 9% faced year-over-year increases of 50 -100%; and

• 6% saw increases in excess of 100% compared to the previous year.

“Price pressures will continue,” the authority said in the report to James. “Buildings considered to be higher risk are expected to face the most significant increases as well as the possibility of not being able to obtain full, or in rare cases any, insurance coverage.""

The data is in an interim report done at the direction of the provincial government. Further findings will be released in the fall after continued stakeholder consultations, Chong said.

The authority regulates the province’s insurance industry, among other things.

CEO Blair Morrison said the market is failing to meet goals of sustainability, affordability and availability.

“Despite large increases already being felt, the situation has not yet stabilized, meaning many stratas, particularly those in buildings considered to be higher risk by insurers, can expect to face further pricing pressures as well as the risk of not being able to obtain full strata property insurance coverage,” Morrison said.

The industry generates about $300 million in premiums, covering more than $100 billion of insured property value. Coverage is mandatory under B.C.’s Strata Property Act, the authority told James.

Insurance under the act, which must provide full replacement value of the common strata property and assets, does not cover individual unit insurance, which owners need to ensure under individual policies.

The authority said earthquake coverage is not required under the act, but it is often included in strata property coverage.

“Strata corporations that choose not to purchase earthquake coverage are still covered for fire damage following an earthquake,” the authority told James. “An estimated 1.5 million residents live in strata properties in BC and properties can range from under $1 million to over $200 million in insured value.”

The investigation found evidence showing the industry has been incurring losses over the past three years from mostly minor claims, particularly from water damage, due to poor building maintenance.

“The data suggests that strata insurance has also been used to fill in the gaps left by other forms of protection such as home warranties for new buildings and maintenance programs for older buildings,” the authority said.

Further complicating things is the exposure to risk insurers have to earthquake damages in B.C. which has prompted many to reduce the amount of insurance they offer, the study found.

“With this reduction in capacity comes upward price pressures,” the authority said.

“It’s clear there is no quick fix for this problem,” James said. “It’s important to recognize that the dynamics driving these increases are playing out in the private insurance industry – government does not set insurance rates or regulate pricing.”

She said the government is reviewing the report and will be bringing in legislation this summer as a first step to help tackle this problem, while the authority continues its engagement with the sector.

While legislation details won’t be released before being introduced in the Legislature, Liberal Party Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson has called on James to take action.

“Skyrocketing strata insurance costs represent one more unexpected hit to the wallets of British Columbians, with a growing number truly at risk of losing their homes. Action by your government is needed now,” Wilkinson said in a June 16 letter to James.

Wilkinson suggested the following actions be taken:

• implementation of a temporary tax holiday on the 4.4% Insurance Premium Tax applicable on strata property to leave money in the pockets of strata owners;

• Extension on a temporary basis the Property Tax Deferment Program to enable strata owners facing extraordinary additional expenses to defer a portion of their property taxes;

• changes to Strata Property Act and regulations that ensure annual contributions are made to a strata corporation’s consolidated revenue fund at levels acceptable considering a building’s age, claims history and other unique circumstances;

• require strata corporations to have a depreciation report detailing necessary maintenance every year;

• require a strata corporation to inform owners and tenants of any material change in insurance coverage, including an increase in any deductible, as soon as feasible;

• develop a mandatory education and training program for strata council members, with particular emphasis on risk mitigation;

• review the B.C. Building Code and implement new requirements focused on the prevention and severity of water damage events, and;

• require the B.C. Financial Services Authority to make public the data and information it is gathering from insurance companies to better understand the current climate of rapidly rising strata insurance.

Condominium Home Owners' Association of B.C. CEO Tony Gioventu in March warned that uninsured condo owners could find themselves bankrupt and homeless if they didn’t maintain suites and personal insurance as strata insurance costs skyrocket.

Birds Nest Properties handles condo and townhouse rentals in Vancouver, Burnaby and Richmond. Director Alvin Cheung said the situation is putting pressures on both strata corporations and individual owners.

Cheung said some buildings have seen deductibles rise from $250,000 to $750,000, situations that have led to special levies for unit owners.

“What if all the owners can’t pay the special levy? What happens then?” he asked.

That could lead to cases of buildings not triggering their insurance leaving owners to pay for repairs or upkeep just not being done.

“It would be a neglected building,” he said.

And that could cause future insurance coverage problems, he agreed.

As well, Cheung said, landlords have seen their landlord insurance premiums leap, in some cases from $500 to $4,000 a year.

The average monthly asking rent for all property types in Canada was down 1.4% in May over April to $1,814, according to the latest National Rent Report from Rentals.ca and Bullpen Research & Consulting.

article continues below

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to put downward pressure on the rental market nationally, with rent down 7.2% from the peak in September at $1,954 per month.

But in Burnaby, the city still managed to come in 13th on the list of 34 cities for average monthly rent for a one-bedroom home at $1,611 and landed on the top-10-worst list for average monthly rent for a two-bedroom at $2,052.

At least we’re not Vancouver.

Vancouver finished second on the list for most expensive rents in May for a one-bedroom home at $2,022 and for a two-bedroom at $2,552.

The average monthly rents in Vancouver were up in May after being down in April.

“We suspect some short-term rentals are being repurposed into long-term rentals, which is affecting the pricing in the rental market,” said a news release.

Average monthly rents increased in May over April in British Columbia by 2.1%.

Local Logic, which covers data on a number of Canadian real estate portals, found that in the Vancouver Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) there was a slight decrease in the share of transit-friendly searches in May.

“This indicates that interest by renters in being near a transit centre is waning,” said the report.

“There was a significant increase in website traffic on Rentals.ca in May,” said Matt Danison, CEO of Rentals.ca. “It appears prospective tenants are doing their research to prepare for a move in the near future.”

“This sharp drop in demand has resulted in landlords dropping their asking rents in most major markets across the country,” said Ben Myers, president of Bullpen Research and Consulting.

The National Rent Report charts and analyzes monthly, quarterly and annual rates and trends in the rental market on a national, provincial, and municipal level across all listings on Rentals.ca for Canada. This month's report charts rents for 34 cities across Canada.",[]

They were also 63% lower than the 10-year sales average for the month - a direct result, said the board, of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Predictably, the number of home sales and listings declined in April given the physical distancing measures in place,” Colette Gerber, REBGV’s president-elect said. “People are, however, adapting.”

According to Gerber, this adaptation is coming in the form of “using different technology to showcase homes virtually, assess neighbourhood amenities with their clients and handle paperwork electronically.”

Across the region, 1,109 homes changed hands last month. This is a 39.4% drop year-over-year and a 56.1% decline compared with March 2020.

The number of new listings for all residential property types was 2,313 in April, which is a 59.7% drop compared with April 2019 and a 47.9% decline compared with March 2020, when 4.436 homes were listed.

The benchmark price for all homes across the region is $1,036,000, which is 2.5% higher than it was one year prior.

“Home prices have held relatively steady in our region since the COVID-19 situation worsened in March,” Gerber said.

A total of 388 detached homes sold in April, which is 33.8% lower than the 586 homes of this type sold in April 2019. The benchmark price for detached homes is $1,462,100 - up 2.3% year-over-year.

In April 2020, 503 apartments were sold, which is 43.2% lower than the 885 homes sold in the same month last year. The benchmark price for apartments is $685,500, up 2.7% from April 2019.

For attached homes, sales reached 218 - a 39.1% decline year-over-year. The benchmark price was $796,800 - up 2.8% compared with the same month last year.

REBGV data includes sales and prices for Vancouver, West Vancouver, North Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Richmond, Port Moody, the Sunshine Coast, Whistler, Squamish, Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge and South Delta. It does not include Langley or Surrey.

However, the vast majority of those transactions were in the first half of the month, and many of those deals reflect pre-pandemic buying activity, due to the reporting lag.

“The first two weeks of the month were the busiest days of the year for our region, with heightened demand and multiple offers becoming more common,” said Ashley Smith, REBGV president. “Like other aspects of our lives, this changed as concerns over the COVID-19 situation in our province grew.”

REBGV said April 2 that residential sales on the region’s MLS averaged 138 per day during the first ten business days of March, and 93 during the final ten business days of the month.

“Many of the sales recorded in March were in process before the provincial government declared a state of emergency. We’ll need more time to pass to fully understand the impact that the pandemic is having on the housing market,” Smith added.

Kevin Skipworth, a realtor with Dexter Realty, said, “This month’s numbers for Greater Vancouver are a tale of what could have been, not so much what will be… There is a time lag between when the contract is written and when it is reported. A degree of [March’s] activity came from transactions that were initiated prior to the increased attention to COVID-19.”

Cameron McNeill, partner and executive director at real estate marketing firm MLA, predicted that the market would see a hiatus until the pandemic is over, but then would rebound later. “While it is too soon to determine the real effects COVID-19 will have on the Greater Vancouver real estate market, we certainly expect significantly slower sales volumes in historically active spring months ahead. The speed and timing of recovery is uncertain, but long-term housing demand for the region will likely be heightened by Canada’s COVID-19 response, and supply constraints.”

Sellers still listing

Despite the pandemic, sellers continued to list their homes in March. There were 4,436 homes listed for sale in Metro Vancouver in March, which is 10.4 per cent lower than March 2019 but a 10.8 per cent increase compared with February 2020 this year, reported the board.

“I was surprised at the number of new listings,” said Skipworth. “It dropped off in the last week of the month but people are still coming to market. Perhaps some people who had been planning on selling decided to do so before the situation gets any worse. We’re also seeing some listing cancellations and re-lists of those properties, so that accounts for some of the new listings.”

With overall sales increasing more than new listings, the sales-to-active listings ratio for March 2020 increased to 26.3 per cent. By property type, the ratio is 21.1 per cent for detached homes, 33 per cent for townhomes, and 28.9 per cent for apartments. These figures indicate a seller’s market, which is defined as more than 20 per cent for a sustained period.

Prices and property types

Home prices in the region also increased again last month. The composite benchmark price for all property types combined in Metro Vancouver is currently $1,033,700. This is a 2.1 per cent increase over March 2019, and a 1.3 per cent rise over February 2020.

Sales of detached homes in March 2020 reached 852, a leap of 61.1 per cent over the 529 detached sales recorded in March 2019. The benchmark price for single-family properties is $1,450,700, which is 0.7 per cent higher than March 2019, and a 1.2 per cent increase compared with February 2020.

March saw 493 attached homes trade hands, which is a 51.7 per cent jump compared with the 325 sales in March 2019. The attached-home benchmark price is now pegged at $791,800, a 2.5 per cent rise from March 2019, and a 0.9 per cent uptick compared with February.

Condo transactions hit 1,179 in March 2020, a 35.1 per cent increase over the 873 sales in March 2019. The benchmark price of an apartment property now stands at $687,000, which is 2.9 per cent higher than in March 2019, and a 1.4 per cent month-over-month rise.

One question mark is whether the no-eviction rule applies retroactively to tenants in recently purchased homes, where the new owner intends to occupy the property, or whether existing eviction notices served before the announcement have been grandfathered in.

article continues below

Now, a leading real estate lawyer in Vancouver has offered clarification on this issue, following advice he received directly from the B.C. government.

Richard Bell of Bell Alliance told Glacier Media Real Estate on Monday, “Up until today [March 30], if an eviction notice has already been given to the tenants to vacate because the buyers are to take possession, that eviction still stands. However, any new home purchase contract, from today onwards, you will not be able to evict the tenant, under any section of the legislation.”

He added, “That was a big concern for us, as we [at Bell Alliance] are working on lots of purchase contracts where the notice of eviction for tenants had already been given. Those purchases can now go ahead.”

However, the eviction ban may significantly affect sales of currently tenanted homes, now that any new buyers wouldn’t be permitted to evict sitting tenants from March 30 onwards, until the ban is lifted.",[]
271,burnabynow,https://www.burnabynow.com/real-estate/buyers-can-t-get-out-of-home-purchase-contracts-because-of-covid-19-1.24109720,Buyers can’t get out of home purchase contracts because of COVID-19,['Joannah Connolly'],,"If you’re in the process of buying a home but have lost income due to COVID-19, don’t assume that you’ll be able to get out of your signed purchase contract, a leading real estate lawyer has warned.

Home buyers who have paid their deposit and signed a purchase contract, who may now want to get out of the purchase since the pandemic hit, do not have a standard “Force majeure” or “Act of God” clause that will let them walk away, said Richard Bell of Bell Alliance in Vancouver. Such a clause would need to have been specifically written into the purchase contract to be applicable, which is unlikely, he said.

What’s more, if the buyer walks away from a purchase contract, even if they have lost their job and can no longer afford the home, they could be liable for much more than simply losing their deposit.

“If a buyer loses their job – well, that could happen any time,” Bell told Glacier Media Real Estate March 30. “If they can’t complete the deal, they become liable for at least the deposit. But there could be a further, knock-on liability, if the seller then resells for less than the original amount. The buyer who caused the original deal to collapse could also be liable for the difference.”

Bell added, “Then the question becomes, if the collapse of the original deal causes a series of deals in a chain to collapse, how remote is the original buyer’s liability? How many links in that chain is the buyer liable for? That’s when you get into a legal battle.”

A purchase contract can, however, be rendered void under the doctrine of “frustration” whereby the deal can’t go ahead and collapses under extraordinary circumstances, through no fault of either party. However, this requires the explicit agreement of both parties to the contract, explained Bell.

For example, a buyer may not want to go ahead with a home purchase due to lost income, and the vendor may equally not want to sell anymore because they can no longer afford to upsize, also due to lost income. Under such circumstances, the buyer and seller can come to an agreement whereby the contract is cancelled and the buyer’s deposit returned.

Cold feet a symptom of COVID-19

Vancouver realtor Kevin Skipworth of Dexter Realty is seeing a lot of nervousness among buyers who have signed purchase contracts. He told Glacier Media Real Estate March 31 that he had one buyer with cold feet because of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated concerns about the economy, but after discussion with their conveyancing lawyers, the deal finally went ahead.

“There’s really nothing in the contract that allows for a buyer to walk away from a transaction because of the virus pandemic, but that doesn’t stop anybody from trying. For us as realtors, it’s not our place to try to negotiate out of a contract, that’s where legal advice is the first place to go.

He agrees with Bell that there can be much pricier ramifications than merely a lost deposit. “Everybody seems to think you can walk away and just lose your deposit and that will be fine, but that’s not the case. Sellers can go after you for damages, and more.”

Bell said he is seeing some collapsed home purchases at his law firm, but this is not currently his key concern in terms of real estate conveyancing. He pointed to rules of social distancing and quarantining making it virtually impossible to comply with legal requirements that home buyers and mortgage consumers be present in person to sign contracts, along with their government ID.

“It’s a major roadblock to closing home purchases right now,” said Bell. “Different lenders require different things. But some are literally requiring that we go round to quarantined clients’ homes and have them show their ID to us through the window. It’s ridiculous. Hopefully it will change before long, so we can do it by video. We’re trying to get this up the chain of command.”

‘Force majeure’ in construction

One sector that may have some luck in claiming “force majeure” when failing to complete a contract due to COVID-19 is the construction industry, where sites have had to close due to the outbreak – depending on such a clause being in the contract.

Whether or not a judge under Canadian common law would grant “force majeure” varies greatly from case to case, said Sahil Shoor, a Waterloo, Ontario-based civil litigator for Gowling WLG, in a legal bulletin to the construction sector on March 20.

That is because while some contracts include “force majeure” clauses that clearly states diseases, plagues, epidemics or quarantine restrictions as applicable conditions (beyond the typical “acts of God” events such as natural disasters, fires, floods and wars), other make no such distinctions. Some other contracts yet, Shoor said, may not have a “force majeure” clause at all, further complicating the issue in court.

“In order to successfully rely on a force majeure clause, the relying party [contractor] has the burden of establishing Force Majeure Event and proving that the Force Majeure Event has effectively prevented the party from fulfilling its obligations under the construction contract,” Shoor said in the bulletin, adding the court will assess the merits of the case based on whether the COVIC-19 outbreak qualifies as a force majeure, whether the risk of not being able to complete the contract was “foreseeable and able to be mitigated,” as well was whether it was really impossible to complete the contract.

In cases where there is no clear description of an epidemic or disease as force majeure, a judge will often hinge decisions on the availability of an “alternative method of performance” – even if the alternative is significantly more expensive for the contractor applying for relief.

“As an example, are the party’s employees ill due to the virus and unable to work, or simply afraid to work and choosing not to attend?” Shoor said, adding that cases without a force majeure clause will follow similar lines of legal logic under the doctrine of frustration.

This is the third 50-basis-point cut this month as the bank does what it can to ease the cost of borrowing during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The unscheduled rate decision brings the bank’s policy interest rate down to 0.25 per cent. At 0.75 per cent, it was the highest such rate among the central banks of G7 countries.

On Friday, Canada’s central bank also announced two new programs to bring greater liquidity to Canadian markets: the Commercial Paper Purchase Program (CPPP), and a quantitative easing program.

Under the latter, the bank will purchase a minimum of $5 billion in Government of Canada securities per week, starting April 1. The program will continue until Canada’s economic recovery is “well underway.”

Over the next 12 months, the CPPP will see the bank undertake primary and secondary market purchases of commercial paper issued by Canadian firms, municipalities and provincial agencies that have an outstanding commercial paper program. Poloz said the program will “help to restore a key source of short-term funding for businesses.”

Bank of Canada rate decisions over the last five quarters | Bank of Canada website

“The intent of our decision today is two-fold: to immediately support the financial system so it keeps on providing credit, and, over the longer term, to lay the foundation for the economy’s return to normalcy,” Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz said in an opening statement to media.

Although existing variable-rate mortgage holders will enjoy additional discounts from the BoC's new rate, whether or not the cuts will be passed on to new mortgage consumers remains to be seen. Thus far, despite two previous recent rate reductions of 50 basis points each, mortgage rates for new customers have been rising, not falling.

“This is a very uncertain time for banks and lenders, just as it is for consumers,” said Alex Conconi, CEO of Lendesk. “While the normal consequence of a Bank of Canada prime rate cut is to pass that on to borrowers, at the end of the day, banks control their own prime rate and it cannot be taken for granted amid COVID-19. Moreover, until recently, it wasn’t unusual to see variable rates that were prime minus something: now that has all but evaporated, and we’re seeing prime plus a spread. The consequence is that the banks are able to shore up some margin, which may be necessary if they are to take losses in other parts of their business. Meanwhile, consumers aren’t necessarily paying any less than they would have been paying a few months ago.”

Tenant advocates are openly wondering if it even makes sense to pay rent.

In a response to the COVID-19 crisis, the March 25 announcement by the provincial government will end virtually all rental evictions – including those currently in process – freeze rental increases, and pay $500 direct to landlords to help tenants battling job and income losses over the next three months.

""This is not the time to seek rent increases and there is just zero per cent chance of that happening,"" said Premier John Horgan. “Landlords will be prevented from legally raising rents starting April 1. Increases slated to take effect on April 1 will no longer be applied.”

Despite the good intentions, many say the unprecedented program is wide open to abuse. This is apparently recognized by the provincial government whose models concede that 100 per cent of B.C.’s 500,000 renters could theoretically qualify for assistance.

The new rental supplement is in addition to federal and provincial programs announced to offer financial aid to those who lose income due to the health crisis.

Mark Goodman, a multi-family real estate specialist with Goodman Commercial Inc. Vancouver, estimates B.C.'s rental aid package could add up to more than $1 billion over the next three months, but argued it is landlords who could end up paying the most. The $500 paid directly to the landlord will not compensate for losses from the rental increase freeze, Goodman said.

This is particularly evident in Metro Vancouver, he said, where the average rent is now $2,351, according to Rentals.ca.

While the $500 payment direct to landlords is welcome, David Hutniak, CEO of LandlordBC, said that, with no potential for evictions, landlords have little protection if a tenant refuses to pay the balance owing.

“This is wide open to potential abuse,” Hutniak said. He added he hoped common decency would keep abuses in check.

“Two-thirds of landlords in Metro Vancouver are mom-and-pop situations,” Hutniak said, which includes people renting out a basement suite or a condominium to help cover the highest mortgages cost in the country. These owners are also struggling during the current crisis, Hutniak said.

According to a December 2019 survey by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., there are 67,000 rental condos in Metro Vancouver.

Hutniak also noted a naivety in the potential of landlords qualifying for a mortgage payment deferral. Premier Horgan encouraged banks to provide this, but Hutniak doubts most landlords would qualify or could afford such a deferral.“We have heard advocates speak about landlords getting mortgage deferrals so they can 'pass those savings onto renters.' But a mortgage deferral by a bank does not constitute any savings to the landlord. It has to be paid back with compound interest on the deferred amount. In other words, interest upon interest,""Hutniak explained. Any deferred amount is added to the mortgage principal, whereas a landlord doesn’t have any security for deferred rent from a tenant, he noted, or from the loss of legal rent increases.

Angela Calla, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres, said landlords are unlikely to get approved for a deferral from some mortgage lenders, even if their tenants can’t pay rent due to lost income. “Deferrals are not being approved on rentals at this time,” she said on March 25. “If/when they are, it will come with additional costs for the landlord, once determined.” However, she updated this information March 26 with the news that Scotiabank is now allowing deferrals regardless of occupancy, and other banks may follow suit.

""It is the government’s expectation that all renters, including those renters impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, who have the capacity to pay rent do the responsible thing and pay their rent,” Hutniak added.

But the Vancouver Tenants Union noted that Premier Horgan conceded he could not guarantee that any rental aid will actually be paid by April 1, when the next rent is due.

“Every person should think towards the future, see where they are going to be in a few months and decide if it makes sense to pay rent,” said Mazdak Gharibnavaz, a steering committee member of the Vancouver Tenants Union, in a March 25 interview on CiTR 101.9 FM’s station at the University of British Columbia.",[]

But with phone lines jammed, and websites unable to process applications that are assessed on a case-by-case basis, many homeowners looking for a deferral or seeking answers have had little success.

Confusion reigns over what makes a homeowner eligible for an emergency deferral, how the program works, whether interest is payable and whether deferring payments will affect credit scores. Unfortunately, with the situation changing on a daily basis, and lenders forced to make up rules as they go, it has been impossible for most people to get any information.

To clear up some of these issues, Glacier Media Real Estate spoke with five mortgage experts who offered their insights and advice on some frequently asked questions.

Would deferring my mortgage payments damage my credit score?

As long as the proper arrangements are made in advance, your credit score should not be affected. Atrina Kouroshnia, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres, says, “I don't think deferring payments will have the same impact as [it did] before, as it's a global [pandemic] and, especially if your job is affected, you are making a proactive choice.”

Peter Kinch, best-selling author and award-winning mortgage broker, agrees, “I do not see a situation wherein this will have any impact on your credit score.”

The number-one most important thing? Never assume that you’ll be able to get the deferral and simply not pay your mortgage when it’s due, as this will damage your credit score. “The worst thing would be to just skip your payments,” warns Kouroshnia.

Angela Calla, also with Dominion Lending Centres, cautions, “If you miss the payment without an agreement or your lender does not approve you, it can impact your credit score and could significantly increase your cost of borrowing at renewal. Each borrower should confirm with the lender before they agree to the deferral.”

How can I get through to my lender?

For those trying to make such arrangements but having trouble getting through, Calla says it’s important to give the banks time. “Unless you have a payment due in the next five days [that you can’t pay], they ask that you delay calling at this time [due to overwhelming call volumes]. Email is preferred, or some lenders have portals they have created to assist with this. Look at your lender’s website for updates.”

Alisa Aragon, also with Dominion Lending Centres, recommends speaking first to your mortgage broker, if you have one. “Lenders are experiencing an overwhelming amount of calls and it is very hard to get through. If people have questions, it is best that they talk to their mortgage expert, as we are getting information from most lenders and we might be able to answer their questions faster.”

Should I apply, and would I be approved, for a deferral?

Once you’ve managed to get through to your lender, you’ll likely only be approved for a payment deferral if you’ve lost income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, say the brokers.

If you’re still working and can afford your mortgage, don’t attempt to get a deferral. Not only will you likely be wasting your time and that of the overstretched lenders, the program should only be used as an emergency last resort. That’s because deferring payments will cost you more money in the long term (see “How would a mortgage payment deferral work?” below).

Only those truly unable to pay their mortgage right now, due to lost income from the pandemic, should apply. “The deferral program is really for homeowners that are experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 virus,” says Aragon. “If you are still employed and earning an income, then lenders will not be assisting those borrowers at this time. This program is for people that really need it.”

For those who feel they meet the requirements, it’s worth applying, and each application will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. “It also depends on the lender,” adds Aragon. “Each lender has its own requirements on what has to be provided.”

Landlords may not get approved for a deferral with some banks, even if their tenants can’t pay rent due to lost income, according to Calla. “Deferrals are not being approved on rentals at this time [March 25],” she says. “If/when they are, it will come with additional costs for the landlord, once determined.” However, Calla has an update of this information as of March 26, with the news that Scotiabank is now allowing deferrals regardless of occupancy, and other banks may follow suit.

One relief for landlords is that tenants unable to pay rent due to lost income can now apply for the new $500-a-month rent supplement, to be paid directly to their landlord via BC Housing, which was announced March 25. However, the accompanying temporary ban on evictions may mean leave landlords without options if tenants don't pay their rent at all.

If I were approved, how would a mortgage payment deferral work?

Make no mistake, a mortgage payment deferral is an emergency, temporary measure that will cost you more in the long term, caution the brokers. What’s more, the longer you defer payments, the more it will cost you, as interest will be payable at your contract rate during the deferral period, and will add up.

Kinch explains, “Your principal and interest payments do not have to be made for a period of [up to] six months. However, the banks will accrue your monthly interest payments and add that amount onto your current mortgage balance. As such, after the six-month deferral period, you will have a larger mortgage balance and your monthly payment will be adjusted accordingly to compensate. So you end up with a cash-flow break today, but you’ll have to make up for it in six months. To be clear – this is a ‘deferral’ not a ‘loan holiday’.”

Kinch’s colleague Jonathan Barlow adds, “Every lender will be different in how they manage it. Ones with deep pockets may allow for the deferral to continue until renewal, when they simply renew with the higher balance. Others may structure a repayment plan. Again, this is untrodden ground for the lenders, so they will all approach it differently.”

Calla says, “You are responsible to pay the deferral [interest] taken on the remaining payments on the term with most lenders. This is why it’s approved only for those who can’t make a payment due to not having the financial means. Everyone’s amounts per month and total interest cost will be different based on mortgage amount, rate and term remaining.”

What if my mortgage is with a monoline lender?

The Big Six Canadian banks, plus some credit unions such as Vancity, have been vocal about offering their mortgage payment deferral programs to those in need. But many Canadian homeowners have their mortgages with alternative specialist mortgage lenders, also known as monoline lenders. So are they offering the same payment deferral program?

Barlow says, “Monolines are supporting the deferral program as well, but because they are single service providers (mortgages only), their monetary base is much smaller. So they will be much more strategic about who they offer it to. They’ll certainly ask more questions, but you’ll likely get a much better plan and collaboration from them.”

As with all mortgage types, for more information about deferring payments, go to your lender’s website and talk to your mortgage broker before braving the long hold times on the customer service lines.",[]

That should be good news for Burnaby renters, but it’s not because while the national average dropped, local rents went up, according to the report.

“It is the inevitable next step,” said Jon Stovell, president and CEO of Reliance Properties and past chair of the Urban Development Institute.

Quebec announced the extended shutdown of the majority of construction sites as it ramped up efforts to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Quebec's construction unions had called for a work stoppage, saying many sites lack proper hygiene control and require working close to others.

B.C. is second only to Quebec in the number of residents infected by COVID-19.

On March 22, six days after B.C. banned large gatherings, its COVID-19 Joint Information Centre released guidelines that allow for construction to continue, provided no more than 50 workers are working in any one space at a time.

Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, has issued a set of guidelines regarding hygiene on construction sites.

Stovell’s company has two big building projects underway, an office tower and a condominium project, and he said his contractors are “going beyond” the provincial measures to assure worker and public safety.

But he believes that all B.C. construction work, aside from infrastructure projects deemed essential, will soon be ordered to close.

A request for comment from the provincial health officer was not received by the Western Investor deadline.

Ron Rapp, CEO of the Homebuilders Association of Vancouver, sent a memo to members this week.

“I told them we have the privilege to continue to work and to make darn sure they all meet the criteria of the provincial health guidelines,” he said.

But Rapp warned that much of the private sector construction in Metro Vancouver – estimated to be worth $10 billion to the B.C. economy and employing up to 130,000 people – could be forced to close regardless of legislation.

A lack of key building supplies due to a broken trade chain, especially from Asia, and the number of people who can’t or won’t report to work is among the problems, he said. He noted that one local supplier, a fabricator, had 25 per cent of its staff test positive for COVID-19.",[]

Reports include inadequate access to washroom facilities, a disregard for social-distancing and workers showing up to job sites sick. On more than one site, workers have no access to hand sanitizer or hand-washing facilities. Multiple workers shared that they risk losing their jobs if they leave, even though colleagues are showing up to work with flu-like symptoms.

Last week, the BC Building Trades Council asked construction workers to report working conditions on job sites during the COVID-19 outbreak. BC Building Trades (BCBT) is now urging WorkSafeBC to enforce mandatory and provincially recommended health and safety practices after reports of unsafe and unsanitary worker conditions.

“Workers are pleading for help – this is urgent,” said BCBT executive director Andrew Mercier in a news release.

“I have been in direct contact with the top brass at WorkSafeBC about this. We need more hand-washing stations. We need better social distancing. Regulations on paper mean nothing if they are not being enforced on the ground.”

One worker who emailed BIV said there are at least 50 people using four washrooms on his Port Moody job site every day, and he has yet to see them cleaned on a daily basis.

Another individual told BIV that a Vancouver site superintendent told workers that he doesn’t care about social distancing: “Either to go to work, or go home.“

A number of the workers who reached out to BCBT – and whose responses have been anonymized – expressed concerns about both continuing to work and about losing their jobs if they chose to stay home or self-isolate. Some have called for non-essential work sites to be shut down.

“The fact no one is shutting these sites down right now is unreal... Well over 200 people sharing this one water hose... No hot water. No hand sanitizer, and five to six bathrooms for the whole site,” wrote one respondent.

Last week, the Urban Development Institute (UDI) said government confirmed that B.C.’s limit on gatherings of more than 50 people does not apply to construction sites. Sites must still follow WorkSafeBC standards and COVID-19 prevention protocols. The latter include additional hand-washing stations and social distancing of one to two metres between workers.

The board said that it was making “this explicit recommendation today with the support of real estate brokerages, and after an assessment of the latest information and commentary from public health and other government authorities.”

REBGV said that, earlier in the week, it had also “removed the rule requiring that properties listed on MLS be made available for showings.”

Ashley Smith, REBGV president said, “Realtors want to do their part to help prevent the spread of illness in our communities and to meet the housing needs of residents in a responsible way. We’ve heard from some in the community who are unhappy that their Realtors are not holding Open Houses. To those people, we ask for your understanding given the public health crisis we all face today.”

The board said that “anyone looking to buy or sell a home in today’s environment is encouraged to discuss COVID-19 preparedness with their Realtor” and offered some key tips for buyers and sellers. These include:

• If you recently travelled abroad and/or are unwell, do not view a property, and stay home.

• If you’re a seller, talk with your Realtor about alternative approaches to open houses, such as virtual showings and other technology-based solutions.

• If you’re a buyer, only visit a property when others are not present, sanitize your hands before and after a showing, and avoid touching doorknobs and other surfaces in the property.

The REBGV is also offering other tips for buyer and sellers at www.rebgv.org.

Construction must go on

Announced the same day was approval to B.C. construction companies to continue site operations, as the ban on gatherings of more than 50 people does not apply to construction sites, according to the Urban Development Institute.

The UDI said in a March 19 statement that “a senior provincial government official has contacted UDI president and CEO Anne McMullin to assure our industry and membership the 50-person limit does NOT apply to construction sites. The provincial government official confirmed that all sites can and should remain operating… Sites must continue to conform to Worksafe BC practices and current COVID-19 prevention protocols. That means additional handwashing stations should be made available, that workers should maintain their social distance of 1-2 metres from one another and during any on-site meetings.”

The UDI statement added, “In addition, the Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said during the March 17 news conference… that ‘Construction work outside is not as much of a risk that we are concerned about... but anyone who’s sick should not be going to work.’”

The Homebuilders Association of Vancouver (HAVAN) also sent out a statement March 19 offering advice to construction employers on site safety during the pandemic.

In a combined press release, all six big banks said they were also working with commercial customers to provide “flexible solutions” for Canadian businesses struggling because of the virus outbreak.

On the same day, credit union Vancity announced that it was also implementing mortgage payment deferrals of up to six months for struggling homeowners.

It wrote in a statement: “Vancity initially responded by introducing a three-month loan deferral program for our members. It is clear the effects of the pandemic will last longer, so today we are announcing an extension of that deferral program for a term of up to six months. This includes mortgages and other loans and will support members facing financial uncertainty and vulnerability from the fallout of coronavirus.”

Vancity said that personal banking and business customers should contact their customer service line to find out how the credit union can help.

It wrote: “Each case will be assessed individually to help people through these difficult times… Other support for Vancity members facing financial difficulties owing to the virus include providing emergency working capital [and] buying back foreign currency at the rate it was sold, for customers impacted by travel disruption, to ensure they do not suffer financial loss.”

During a press conference, Premier Horgan said these are among the many issues the province has on its plate, and government is looking at next steps, using a cross-governmental approach.

article continues below

""It's not just individual renters that are concerned. Businesses who have rents to pay and no customers coming in the door are equally concerned. So we have a whole range of issues that are piling up and we're looking at what mechanisms we have to assist these individuals,"" he said at the press conference March 17.

""But I want to stress, as I did on Friday, the objective of our government is to provide services for people. That's why we're here. We do not want to come up short. I've made that clear to deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland in our daily discussions — that we all need to work on this together.""

Chandra Herbert, meanwhile, headed up the three-person rental housing task forced that criss-crossed the province in 2018 to come up with recommendations to modernize the Rental Tenancy Act.

Chandra Herbert is now reaching out to many of the same people and groups he dealt with on that file to make short-term and long-term recommendations with respect to the impact coronavirus will have on renters and rental housing.

“It's quick work in terms of short-term [recommendations] given rents come due at the end of the month. We'll have to be looking at that as an issue. We're looking at how to support renters, but also landlords — there's a number of smaller landlords [for whom] the rent cheque is often also the mortgage cheque,” he told the Courier March 17.

“Tomorrow, I understand, the federal government will be making major announcements around rents, in part. We don’t have an early preview of that, but it will inform the work.”

Chandra Herbert has already put out calls to organizations such as the B.C. Non-Profit Housing Association, the Tenant Resource and Advisory Centre and LandlordBC. Within government, he’ll be checking in with B.C. Housing, as well as Vancouver and Victoria’s rental advisory committees.

“It’s not everybody under the sun — we have to work faster than that — but I'm doing my best to get out to as many folks that have key experience in this work,” he said. “I’ve set my own deadline — as soon as possible. The sooner we can get action, the sooner people have some peace of mind, which is in short supply right now.”

Challenges are numerous as April 1 approaches and rent becomes due. Some workers have already lost jobs while others are at risk of losing them. Some residents are in quarantine or self-isolation. Landlords of smaller and larger buildings, meanwhile, as well as those who rent suites in their homes, face mortgage payments.

“[Some renters] may not be able to get rent money because they're not working or they may have been laid off — if you're a casino worker or somebody in the entertainment industry, for example — the film business,” Chandra Herbert said. “In many cases, people are one paycheque away from not being able to afford rent.”

But, he added, some relief sooner than later, depending what the federal government announces Wednesday.

“CMHC on the federal level has said they're looking at mortgage deferrals and questions like that. But really, [after] we hear what the federal cabinet is announcing tomorrow, we'll see what we, as a province, needs to do,” he added.

“They have a considerable fiscal firepower at their disposal. We'll watch them and then see what more we can do. Certainly, we've been encouraging the federal government to look at the challenge of renters, of course, the challenge with mortgage holders, people in the gig economy who might not qualify for EI, and that kind of thing.”

Under the province’s current Residential Tenancy Act, meanwhile, evictions are still possible — an issue renters’ advocates want addressed. Changes could come.

“Most folks aren't paying rent until the end of this month, so it's all on the table,” Chandra Herbert said.

Since 2010, Burnaby has seen a net loss of 478 units, while Vancouver has added 2,227, according to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) data.

article continues below

That stat, included in a housing presentation at a Vancouver city council meeting this summer, prompted a jab from Coun. George Affleck on Twitter.

“Wow. Vancouver can’t build all the rental units alone,” he tweeted. “Our neighbours need to step up too.”

The only other Metro municipality besides Burnaby to see a net loss of units was White Rock, which shed 25, and Affleck said some communities aren’t doing enough to make sure rentals are built.

“Each city should be doing whatever they can to certainly not lose rental housing,” he told the NOW. “I just don’t think that’s good community building to lose rental housing.”

Supply and demand

While the issue is complex, UBC real estate economist Thomas Davidoff said the supply of rental units does impact the price of rent in the region.

“When you build more units you’re absorbing people who are willing to pay a lot to live here,” he said, “and the more you build, the less willing to pay you have to be to cross the threshold into occupancy.”

Vancouver has added to its market rental stock over the past decade by hanging on to existing stock and through policies like Rental 100, which provides incentives for developers to build rentals, according to Davidoff.

“I think Burnaby’s a quite different environment,” he said.

New Metrotown condo towers dwarf old lowrise rental apartments slated for demolition. - Cornelia Naylor

David Goodman, founder of the Goodman Report, a resource on trends in rental apartment sales, agreed.

He has criticized Vancouver for not doing enough to encourage developers to build new purpose-built market rental housing but said that city is “light years” ahead of Burnaby.

“It’s a philosophical and political decision: let the province and the feds look after rental housing; it’s not our job,” Goodman said of Burnaby. “In the process, of course, Burnaby has certainly enriched their coffers with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars from the development community.”

Burnaby ended the 2016 fiscal year with more than $1 billion in reserve funds, and a chunk of that has come from developers who pay for increased density when they build condo towers in place of old low-rise apartment buildings.

The city could afford to forgo some of that money, according to Goodman, and use it to provide incentives to developers to build rentals instead of allowing the city to become “top heavy” with condos, an approach he said impacts the “social fabric” of the community.

“The irony is, here is sort of an NDP government in Burnaby who are basically saying, ‘Not our problem. You want rentals? Let the market do it,’” Goodman said.

But the market is unlikely to “do it,” according to UBC's Davidoff.

“People really want to build condos in this day of extremely high valuations,” he said. “Why be a landlord and go through all the hassle, when you can build a building, get paid a fortune and walk away. That’s what I’d do, definitely. The only reason I wouldn’t is if the city was like, ‘Well, we’ll give you an incentive if you keep it rental.’”

Incentives

Unlike Burnaby, neighbouring New Westminster has a policy specifically designed to make building purpose-built market rental housing more attractive to developers.

Its Secured Market Rental Housing Policy, adopted in 2013, grants developers breaks on parking requirements (one parking stall can cost a developer $25,000 to $35,000 to build) and increases in density in return for the developers agreeing to build secured market rental housing units.

The city further streamlines approvals for projects with secured market rental housing and picks up the tab for the legal costs involved in drawing up rental housing agreements – with the city aiming for 60-year agreements, according to acting manager of planning John Stark.

“All those tools are available. I guess it all depends on the policies and priorities of council,” Stark said.

While Burnaby saw a net loss of 478 purpose-built market rental housing units from 2010 to 2016, New Westminster (with one-third of the population of Burnaby and one-fifth of its land base) added 107.

But New West isn’t just interested in building new rentals, according to Stark, since new suites aren’t as affordable as existing units.

“From a city perspective, we see the benefits of having both new market rental and also preserving the existing stock, with regards to families, new immigrants who are looking for housing, trying to create a diverse community,” Stark said.

Toward that end, Stark said New West’s mayor and council has signalled strongly to developers that it is not entertaining development applications that would result in the loss of purpose-built market rental housing – unless the older buildings need to be demolished for structural reasons.

A different approach

Burnaby, meanwhile, has been roundly criticized by housing activists for rezoning that they estimate will ultimately lead to the loss of nearly 700 old purpose-built rental units and the displacement of 1,400 people in the Metrotown area alone.

The city has chosen not to use density bonuses to encourage Metrotown developers to replace those old units with new purpose-built market rental suites as New West has done.

Instead, through its community benefit bonus policy and housing fund, the city awards density increases in exchange for community amenities and affordable or special-needs housing, which developers either build or pay for.

The policy has seen the construction of 19 low-income and special needs units and the collection of $58 million to support non-market housing projects.

The city uses the money to lease its land to such projects at reduced or nominal rates. It currently supports 302 units on seven properties and recently approved about 200 more at two other sites.

“We have not given bonus density in order to get market rental housing; we’ve only given bonus density to get non-market rental housing,” Mayor Derek Corrigan told the NOW. “We’ve made a very distinct choice in our municipality.”

This approach hasn’t produced nearly as many non-market rental units in Burnaby as the market rentals going up in neighbouring cities.

That would be impossible, according to the mayor, because non-market rentals need ongoing subsidization through partnerships with government and other agencies.

But market rental housing isn’t the city’s responsibility to subsidize, as far as Corrigan is concerned.

“We shouldn’t be taking the money that can go into building the infrastructure and the amenities that are required to serve a growing population and use it to subsidize a private entrepreneur’s development,” he said. “Why should I take a property taxpayer’s money and give it to a developer to plead with him to build market housing that he’s going to make a profit off of.”

Growing gap

It’s not like there aren’t any purpose-built market rentals going up in Burnaby.

There are currently 1,607 units in the development approval process in the city, with 1,200 in the re-zoning application stage and 407 under construction.

But the city has also approved the demolition of 749 such units since 2011 – 167 in 2017 alone.

In comparison, New Westminster has 1,216 secured market rental units in the development approval process –150 approved, and 1,066 with shovels already in the ground. And, since 2011, New West has approved the demolition of only 55 units – zero in 2017.

In its 2016 housing profile, the City of Burnaby argues the 1,558 new strata units built in place of the old purpose-built rental apartments that have been demolished will add about 390 market rental units to Burnaby’s rental stock, as an estimated 25 per cent of the private investors who buy the condos decide to rent them out.

Since the owners of such units may choose to occupy or sell them at any time, however, they are a less secure form of housing than purpose-built rentals.

And Goodman said it would take about 40 to 50 per cent of owners to decide to rent out their condos to plug the gap the city is creating in the rental housing market by not incentivizing developers to build purpose-built units.

“There’s a huge gap that exists today, and in five or 10 years it’s going to be a debacle,” Goodman said. “It creates a very serious imbalance in a society where only the rich can live and you don’t have accommodation for the workers. Where are the workers going to live?”

Cities, however, don’t have the power or resources to fix those problems, according to Corrigan.

“We’re limited,” he said, “and I think because we have been a relatively rich city, there’s this expectation that we should pick up for what the federal and provincial government aren’t doing.""

Terms to know:

Market ownership: houses and condos built by private individuals, developers or for-profit companies. Sold individually and either occupied by owners or rented out as secondary rental.

Secondary rental: houses, condos and secondary suites owned by private individuals or investors and rented out to occupants who are not the owners.

Secured or purpose-built market rental: apartments constructed by private individuals, developers and for-profit companies for the sole purpose of renting. Typically found in multi-family buildings all under a single ownership. Suites are not strata titled and cannot be sold individually. Rental housing agreements keep them rental for a set period of time. Rented out at market rates.

Non-market, social, subsidized or affordable: typically built by non-profit agencies with funding from government. Some is built directly by government. Historically, most non-market housing was constructed through federal/provincial partnerships with non-profit societies.

There were 2,150 transactions on the residential resale market in February 2020, a 44.9 per cent rise over February 2019, and 36.9 per cent higher than the 1,571 homes sold in January 2020.

article continues below

Even though February’s total sales was 15.9 per cent below the 10-year average for the month, the supply of available homes for sale was unable to meet demand.

“Home buyer demand again saw strong year-over-year increases in February while the total inventory of homes for sale struggled to keep pace,” said Ashley Smith, REBGV president. “This was most pronounced in the condominium market.”

(Story continues below)

This lack of competition increased the pressure on home prices, with the benchmark composite price of a Metro Vancouver home rising slightly again last month. The benchmark price for all residential properties combined, across the region, now stands at $1,020,600, which is a 0.3 per cent increase over February 2019 and a 2.7 per cent increase over the past six months.

(Story continues below)

Although new listings in February were 3.4 per cent higher than in January, the total number of homes for sale as of the end of February was 20.7 per cent lower than the same month last year, at 9,195 units.

The sales-to-active listings ratio in February 2020 was 23.4 per cent. It is deemed to be a seller’s market if the measure is more than 20 per cent for several consecutive months. By property type, the ratio is 17.3 per cent for detached homes (a balanced market), 26.9 per cent for townhomes, and 28.4 per cent for apartments (both now seller’s markets).

Smith added, “Our Realtors are reporting increased traffic at open houses and multiple offer scenarios in certain pockets of the market. If you’re considering listing your home for sale, now is a good time to act with increased demand, reduced competition from other sellers, and some upward pressure on prices.”

Sales and prices by property type and area

Although detached homes in Metro Vancouver saw the lowest sales-to-listings ratio, it was the submarket to see the most rapid sales growth in February. There were 685 single-family home sales across the region last month, which is a jump of 52.9 per cent year over year.

The benchmark price for a detached Metro Vancouver house has not recovered its recent losses yet, but it is recovering. The benchmark price for a detached home in the region is now $1,433,900. This is 0.7 per cent lower than in February 2019 but a 1.9 per cent increase compared with the low point seen around six months ago.

Whistler and Squamish were again the markets to see the biggest annual jump in typical detached home values, up 15.7 per cent and 10.1 per cent respectively. The steepest price loss in the REBGV’s jurisdiction was seen in Bowen Island, where typical detached prices are down 8.4 per cent year over year, followed by the Sunshine Coast, down 7.8 per cent.

Sales of attached Metro Vancouver homes such as townhouses and duplexes totalled 404 in February, a 45.8 per cent increase compared with the 277 sales in February 2019.

A typical attached home in the region now sells for $785,000, according to the board. This is 0.6 per cent higher than in February 2019 and a 1.7 per cent increase over the past six months.

As with detached homes, Whistler and Squamish townhome prices have seen the biggest increases in the region, up 7.5 and 7.2 per cent respectively. Once again, resale townhome prices in Ladner (down 5.0 per cent) and Tsawwassen (down 4.5 per cent) dropped the most year over year, although those declines are not as steep as they have been recently.

Some 1,061 Metro Vancouver condos traded on the MLS last month, which is a 39.8 per cent increase over the 759 sales in February 2019.

With the demand for condos highest of all the property types, and supply not keeping up, the price of a typical Metro Vancouver condo has recovered the most so far. The benchmark price of an apartment property now stands at $677,200, which is 0.9 per cent higher than in February 2019 and a 3.6 per cent increase over the past six months.

Surprisingly, given the rise in detached and townhome prices in the area, Squamish condos saw the region’s biggest annual condo price drops, down 6.8 per cent. Port Moody and Coquitlam were the areas with the biggest benchmark condo price rises, up four and three per cent year over year respectively.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

The health authority added the outbreak of C. difficile to its list of current outbreaks on July 14.

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Rash

If you are visiting someone who is located on an outbreak unit, visitors may be limited to two people at a time.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

Vince Li wants to have a word with you about that. The 26-year-old had been battling a fever for several days back in March when he made his way to Burnaby Hospital looking for answers.

The results of an X-ray and blood test revealed tell-tale signs of COVID-19. Doctors decided to immediately sedate, intubate, and send Li to Royal Columbian Hospital, one of the province’s primary COVID-19 sites. There, he became the youngest COVID-positive patient to be mechanically ventilated in the hospital’s intensive care unit during the pandemic’s spring peak, according to the RCH foundation.

“I didn’t have a chance to tell anybody,” Li recalls after hearing he would be placed in an induced coma. “My mom was outside at the waiting area in the ER, and social workers called her.”

“His blood levels of oxygen were ridiculously low, so he needed quite a lot of oxygen to support him,” said Dr. Robert Sharpe, a critical care physician at RCH. “His carbon dioxide levels were also quite high. It was quite difficult to blow off CO2 because his lungs were greatly inflamed from the body’s reaction to the virus. He was pretty touch and go early on.”

A personal trainer and competitive mixed-martial artist who controlled his type 2 diabetes through diet and exercise, Li remained hospitalized for a month and remembers nothing about the first three weeks. During that time, ICU teams kept a close watch on his blood gases, made sure his organs were getting enough oxygen, and watched for signs of new infections.

Since there is no specific treatment yet for COVID-19, patients are supported medically in the hopes they can fight off the virus.

“He fooled us a couple of times, where we thought he was ready to come off the ventilator,” said Sharpe. “And then we just needed to give him more time, and he turned around.”

When he regained consciousness, Li was surprised at the amount of weight and muscle he lost. It took him a while to start moving comfortably again.

“In the beginning, it was pretty rough,” he said. “I didn’t realize that being in a bed for a month, I could have so much muscle atrophy.”

While his time at Royal Columbian is hazy, Li says the care – from the doctors to the nurses and physiotherapists – stands out, as does other, simpler milestones.

“My fondest memory was getting the tubes out of my nose and eating actual food for the first time in a month,” Li said. “That felt pretty good.”",[]

Just how much value? Well, apartment buyers have paid 4.5-per-cent above assessed value on average for units near a SkyTrain station between March 15 and May 31, 2020, according to a report by Vancouver-based real estate marketing and analytics firm Roomvu.

The report, which compared the sold price of apartments to government assessed values, found apartments in some Metro Vancouver areas sold at the highest rates above assessed value - 6, 5.6 and 5 per cent respectively. While the lowest discrepancy between sold price and assessed value was in Richmond at 2.3 per cent.

“Access to transit has become valuable over the course of time. Prices of transit-friendly homes rose over the course of the year in spite of the far-reaching negative economic consequences of the pandemic,” said Thomas Davidoff, economist and professor at UBC’s Sauder School of Business. “Social distancing measures have undeniably made selling a home more difficult, as hosting open-houses and in-person tours have become difficult or impossible. That said, we still continue to see a very strong relationship between price point and sales performance, both in terms of sales to listings and price relative to assessment.”

“Looking at the difference between sold prices and government assessed value paints a more accurate picture of market activity than looking at price alone,” said Sam Merhbod, a Vancouver-area realtor and CEO at Roomvu. “COVID-19 has certainly dealt a blow to Vancouver’s real estate market overall, but the apartment segment is showing some signs of recovery,” he added.",[]

Like the dangers of being a pedestrian in the Cardston Court area of Burnaby.

article continues below

Cardston is located just south of Lougheed Highway near Lougheed Town Centre and I lived for several years at the corner of Cardston and Government Street, next to Keswick Park.

This was the scene of a wild rollover crash that saw a pedestrian get hit and I wasn’t the least bit surprised.

Neither was Vicki Sanderson, who brought the crash to my attention to raise awareness about how dangerous this area is for pedestrians, cyclists and even other drivers.

“(The driver) lost control of his vehicle, hit a parked car, which ended up in the park, but not before hitting a young woman walking her dog,” Sanderson said.

And this wasn’t the first incident, only the most recent. Two weeks ago, Sanderson saw another scary incident.

“A speeding car coming down Cardston Court saw a green light, turned left and hit a woman in the crosswalk. This is not unusual on this street - speeding and reckless driving is a huge problem. We have many families who walk these streets down to the park and how long before we have a fatality? Small children and speeding cars? What can the city do? Speed bumps? Seriously needs some consideration.”

I wouldn’t hold my breath for speed bumps. Usually, those have to be resident-initiated and it’s hard to get people to sign a petition.

But it really is a bad area, mainly due to all the ratrunners on Government trying to avoid Lougheed. This stretch also has some steep turns and drivers floor it after they cross Lougheed. The lanes are also really narrow because their are usually vehicles parked on either side of Cardston.

These lanes are pretty unforgiving.

I saw so much of that around 1990 when I lived there and it’s sad to think that things have actually gotten worse in the area.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians.

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

What to look out for

The BBB says consumers should look out for the following red flags is they are searching for a lender or loan broker:

The health authority added the outbreak of C. difficile to its list of current outbreaks on July 14.

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Rash

If you are visiting someone who is located on an outbreak unit, visitors may be limited to two people at a time. Fraser Health asks that you do not visit other patient rooms or common areas on the unit such as the lounge and patient kitchenette. It also recommends you don’t visit public areas in the hospital such as the cafeteria and gift shop.",[]

Hate-fuelled graffiti on the home of a Summerland family. Systemic racism and sexism, both overt and covert, at all levels of society.

Prejudice is indeed pandemic. Bigotry is a virus. And we all have the potential to be hosts (even those of us from racialized minorities).

We’re not born with it in our blood. It’s transmitted from person to person. From family to family. It’s learned through conversations, comments, jokes, judgements, looks, books, micro-aggressions, political rhetoric, insults, attitudes, ignorance, and even classroom lesson plans.

It infects entire institutions to the point where everyone within the organization becomes immune to biased hiring practices, offensive language, token diversity, racial and religious profiling, and exclusive, patriarchal power structures.

And like COVID-19, it won’t just go away on its own. We have to track it and attack it. We have to trace it, isolate it, and call it out. By name. Persistently. We have to propose anti-racist policies, pass anti-racist laws, and push for anti-racist consequences.

We have to stop passively and proudly saying we’re not racist. And we have to start actively and loudly being anti-racist. We have to listen to those with lived experience.

We have to hold elected officials (and each other) accountable. We have to. And we can.

The world has changed dramatically over the last two months, since George Floyd took his last breath on May 25, 2020. In many ways, the globe has gotten smaller, as evidenced by the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (with about 13.5 million cases worldwide and over 580,000 deaths and rising), and the massive outpouring of protesters on city streets from Vancouver to Sydney screaming that Black Lives Matter.

No matter what language we speak or what corner of the Earth we inhabit, “social distancing” has become a part of our everyday vocabulary and behaviour.

Yet science has proven that all human beings – regardless of colour, class, culture, gender, or sexual orientation – are inextricably linked like never before.

As the motto goes, we’re all in this together. Overnight, we’ve all become armchair epidemiologists. Following the lead of our Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbians have sacrificed and worked hard to flatten the curve of COVID-19.

Complacency is not an option. We can’t afford to go backwards. And we must be equally vigilant and aggressive to finally squash the scourge of white supremacy, police brutality, systemic racism, and hatred in all its insidious forms.

Silence is no longer acceptable. We’re in a pandemic. And lives are at stake.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

Starting in early 2014, Patrick Fox set out on a campaign to make the life of his ex-wife, Desiree Capuano “as miserable as possible, hoping to drive her to suicide if that could be done within the confines of the law,” according to B.C. Supreme Court documents.

article continues below

He created a website in her name, posting private information about her and people associated with her, maligning her as a white supremacist, drug addict and child abuser.

“Mr. Fox tormented Ms. Capuano in every way he could, taking considerable time and effort to do so,” stated a Nov. 10, 2017 sentencing decision by B.C. Supreme Court Justice Heather Holmes.

A jury had found Fox guilty in June 2017 of criminal harassment and weapons charges.

(Fox had shipped four handguns, ammunition and a disassembled Mauser rifle illegally to the U.S., where Capuano lives.)

He was sentenced to three years and 10 months in jail, minus just over two years for time he had already served.

He was also given three years of probation, during which he was banned from contacting or publishing information about Capuano or her friends and relatives.

He was also banned from using the internet except for the purpose of employment or sending personal emails and forbidden to leave B.C. or get within 100 metres of the U.S. border.

Fox has already been found guilty of breaking two of those conditions by leaving the province and being within 100 metres of the U.S. border on March 19, 2019, according to court documents.

He was sentenced last month to one day in jail (after spending eight months in pretrial custody) and to another 18 months of probation for those breaches.

He was back in court this week to face charges for two more alleged breaches between March 7 and March 21, 2019, during which time he is alleged to have accessed the internet and made another website, www.desicapuano.com, publicly available.

A one-day trial was scheduled in Vancouver provincial court Wednesday, but Fox, who is representing himself in the case and appeared via video link from the North Fraser Pretrial Centre, requested an adjournment so he could appear in person to cross-examine the prosecution’s only witness, a police detective.

Fox was not in court because someone on his unit had tested positive for COVID-19.

Judge James Bahen agreed to the adjournment but cautioned Fox there was no guarantee the next hearing would be in-person.

“No one, myself included, would take upon themselves the ability to predict the course of the pandemic and whether or not it’s going to be a factor that would affect policies in courts and correctional centres,” Bahen said.

Fox’s trial was rescheduled for Aug. 19.

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

article continues below

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The man and woman, who have asked not to be identified, were taken in by what appeared to be a call from their grandson in dire need of help.

article continues below

“The guy sounded so much like our grandson. If he had said ‘Grandma,’ we’d have known [it wasn’t him] right away, but he said ‘Nan’ and so does my grandson,” said the man.

The imposter grandson, who used their grandson’s name, called on Monday and told them he had been driving a friend’s car and struck a vehicle with Quebec licence plates that had turned sharply in front of him.

The fake grandson went on to say he had been taken to jail, but a judge would free him if he could pay for the damage, estimated to be $5,000. The grandparents were told to send money to the car’s owner in Montreal.

“I wasn’t cluing in at all [that this was a scam], he sounded so much like our grandson,” the man said.

The dutiful grandparents then took cash from their bank and went to the Bank of Montreal and using an account number the scammer had provided via an accomplice posing as a lawyer, they sent money to a BMO branch in downtown Montreal.

“The kid said, ‘Please don’t tell Dad,’ ” the man said. It wasn’t until he later talked to his grandson that it became clear they had been scammed.

The couple has since been in touch with police and the Bank of Montreal, which they say has been very helpful.

“They are doing their best to try and get the money back,” said the man, who thinks the scammers “took a shot in the dark and got lucky.”

But according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, it’s likely the scammers mined information like the grandson’s name from social media to make the pitch more convincing.

The centre calls these types of scams “the emergency scam.” It preys on the fear of a loved one being hurt or in trouble. The scammer claims to be someone you know and says they need money immediately. They tend to use scenarios like needing bail money because they’ve been arrested, or being in a car accident, or having trouble returning from a foreign country.

The targets are often seniors and the scammer pretends to be a grandchild, who begs them not to tell their parents that they’re in trouble, the Anti-Fraud Centre said. As a result, the grandparent doesn’t find out until after they’ve sent the money that their grandchild was not the person who asked for help.

Const. Cam MacIntyre said scammers will go to any lengths to defraud a victim.

“They will pose as a family member, a trusted member of the public, or even the police. We strongly recommend that people never deposit money into accounts of people or entities they do know personally,” he said.

“It’s so important to verify where your money is going. Call a family member, a friend, or the police if you are suspicious.”

The Anti-Fraud Centre says there were 18,803 reports of fraud, and 6,671 victims reporting losses of $22.6 million in Canada in the first four months of this year.

MacIntyre suggests if you are in the process of providing financial information or sending money to potential fraudsters, stop immediately.

“Contact your financial institutions and ensure all payments that you have not authorized are stopped. Inform them of the fraud and change both passwords and access information,” he said.

Suspected frauds can be reported to your local police or the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501.

Such as Barnet Highway. I should know – I’m sure I’ve sped along there as well. You get out of traffic from Hastings on one side and Port Moody on the other and you just feel like letting loose.

But you shouldn’t, of course, and a whole bunch of drivers learned this the hard way on Monday as Burnaby RCMP partnered with Port Moody police for a speed trap.

It was like fish in a barrel as 61 violation tickets were handed out. Most were speeding, as 44 drivers were nailed. Cops also nailed drivers for distracted driving, failing to wear a seatbelt and being caught with cannabis.

This follows a recent speed trap set up on Burnaby Mountain in which traffic officers caught a driver going 110 km/h in a 50 km/h zone, landing this person a whopping $483 ticket and losing their vehicle for a week.

The week before, the Burnaby RCMP’s traffic enforcement unit stung a bunch of reckless speeders on Father’s Day. The officers targeted playground zones to catch speeds ignoring the 30 km/h rules. A total of 20 tickets were handed out and an insane 11 drivers were caught doing more than double the speed limit. In April, police caught a driver treating Burnaby’s Willingdon Avenue like it was the Trans Canada Highway.

The driver was going – get this – 113 km/h in a 50 km/h zone.

I think ICBC should just no longer insure these drivers for a year. This is one way that I’m sure would teach these maniacs a lesson.

People responding to a Burnaby RCMP tweet had other suggestions.

“Can you just imagine what our traffic would be like if there was a law that took away the offender's car? When I was 10, my Dad took 5c out of my allowance for every time a light was left on. I learned quicker than these morons. I so feel for the police. Zero punishment.”

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.'s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a ""second wave"" of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The fiscal and economic report released a week ago detailed the Liberals' financial expectations, including a $343.2-billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Parliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux says in a report that there are other numbers behind the biggest ones that MPs and senators should question.

He points to projections that enterprise Crown corporations, such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. and Business Development Bank of Canada, will collectively lose $12 billion this fiscal year.

Giroux notes that loss is a sharp turnaround from the $7.3 billion in gains for the 12-month period ending in March.

He says losses are unusual for these Crown corporations and adds that each should provide detailed projections to Parliament as soon as possible about its COVID-19 liquidity programs.

Similarly, Giroux says the Liberals should provide details of their own borrowing, which his office estimates will exceed by $150 billion the ceiling set by federal legislation.

The budget office estimates the government's planned debt issuance this fiscal year of $713 billion will cost $2.2 billion annually in interest.

The report released Thursday also notes $4.4 billion in spending for measures the government has yet to announce.

All the spending is expected to push the federal debt past the $1-trillion mark.

The Liberals had previously made a declining debt-to-GDP ratio key to their fiscal plans, but skyrocketing spending will push the ratio to 49 per cent from 31.1 per cent.

Giroux says fiscal transparency and accountability would be enhanced if the Liberals identify their new ""fiscal anchor,"" how they'll measure their own successful handling of the budget and national economy, which wasn't specifically laid out in the update last week.

He said the federal government will contribute $19 billion under the ""Safe Restart Agreement.""

article continues below

The money is to help the lower-tier governments with needs such as funding child care, bailing out cities whose expenses have soared and revenues plunged, increasing contact-tracing capacity, and buying personal protective equipment.

Trudeau had promised $14 billion in early June, but several premiers resisted some of the conditions the federal Liberals wanted to put on the money and said it wasn't enough.

Ontario's Doug Ford was one who didn't like a federal demand that some of it fund up to 10 days of paid sick leave to discourage workers with precarious employment from going into work ill. Quebec's Francois Legault wanted the money to be transferred without conditions so provinces could use it on whatever they considered most important.

Trudeau said the agreement outlines seven priority areas, with some flexibility for the provinces to apply the money to their particular needs over the next six to eight months.

""The provinces agreed to invest in the targeted sectors,"" Trudeau said. ""There are areas like support for vulnerable people where we will expect the provinces to declare publicly what they will do.""

At his side, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland added the agreement includes standards in certain areas, such as COVID-19 testing, in exchange for the federal money.

The pandemic is a health crisis, but Trudeau said it has a deep economic dimension that the funding is intended to address.

He said workers can't work if their children don't have safe care, and many can't get to their jobs if they don't have access to safe transit systems.

That means funding public services better so they don't have to rely on crowding many people into small spaces for their finances to make sense.

Municipal governments, which deliver many of those services, have been warning for months that their finances are careening toward brick walls and have been begging for aid.

Canada's largest city, Toronto, has reported that it's facing a $1.35-billion deficit this year. Montreal says it has a $500-million shortfall. Halifax expects to be short $85.4 million.

Coroner Paul Dionne says 32-year-old Ihor Horbanov died of multiple trauma on March 11, 2019, after his car hit the pothole near Contrecoeur, Que., and crashed behind a Transport Department truck.

In his report published in April, Dionne notes the segment of Autoroute 30 where the accident occurred was known to be problematic.

Dionne also says emergency repairs were conducted on that stretch of road three days prior to the fatal incident.

He notes, however, the department has since taken steps to repair the highway and to review the way potholes are identified and fixed.

Dionne says Horbanov's car was otherwise in good condition and he had not consumed any alcohol when he skidded off the road while driving with his family.

""The ruin of the First Nations and peoples of Canada is not just statistics. As seen here, it is real pain,"" Justice Chris Martin said in a written decision delivered July 10.

Anthony McKay was sentenced to four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the death of his mother, Shirley McKay. He faces two years behind bars, after receiving credit for time already served, and will be subject to three years of supervised probation after that.

""As a human, Mrs. McKay deserved better. And, like anyone born in this bountiful country, her son, her killer, deserved a better start, a better chance, in life,"" Martin wrote.

The judge said the killing on the Berens River First Nation, about 300 kilometres north of Winnipeg, was a ""calamity of almost 150 years of government policy, actions and inactions affecting the Indigenous community.""

Anthony McKay, who was 21 at the time, went to his mother's home after a night of drinking on June 22, 2018.

Court was told there was blood everywhere when a cousin came over about 8 a.m. The cousin found Shirley McKay unconscious and badly beaten. Her son has said he doesn't know why he viciously beat her.

The woman was taken to a nursing station before being transported to a hospital in Winnipeg. Her son visited her in hospital daily and was overheard at her bedside sobbing and apologizing.

Court heard he was confronted by a stepbrother and admitted that he had hurt his mother.

Shirley McKay died that September. Her son was arrested the following month.

""She did not recover and died months later, another victim in a mass of slain Aboriginal women,"" Martin said. ""He pled guilty to manslaughter, joining an appalling line of young Aboriginals ending up in prison.""

Crown prosecutors were asking for a seven-year sentence in a federal penitentiary. The defence asked for two years behind bars plus the probation so that McKay could have access to programming available in provincial custody.

The judge pointed to impacts of colonization, the pass system which restricted Indigenous Peoples' movement, residential schools and the '60s Scoop in his sentencing.

""It is well accepted that the government's role, since the early days of dealing with First Nations peoples, has had the effect of isolating, infantilizing, marginalizing, and traumatizing Indigenous societies like the Ojibwa (or Anishinaabe) of Berens River,"" Martin wrote.

""Mr. McKay is a person shaped by a system historically designed to 'take the Indian out of the Indian.'""

Reports provided to the judge on McKay's background said he has partial fetal alcohol syndrome.

One of 13 siblings, he spent most of his time in foster homes on the First Nation or more often in Winnipeg. His parents struggled with alcohol and sniffing substances, and McKay followed a similar path starting when he was 13. His father died in 2010.

McKay was neglected and not cared for, files from child and family services said. He asked to become a permanent ward of child welfare in 2013 because he didn't feel safe with his family.

Martin said McKay's troubled upbringing doesn't excuse his behaviour, but does help explain why he is who he is.

Occasionally it is incumbent on a judge to underscore systemic issues, he said, adding Indigenous people are disproportionately affected by serious crime and disproportionately incarcerated.

""Like so many other cases, this case is troubling, not only for its specific facts, but because it reminds that core issues affecting many in the Indigenous population are not really being addressed sufficiently or urgently enough,"" Martin wrote.

""Many in this and the next generation of Indigenous people are at risk.""

323,burnabynow,http://www.burnabynow.com/experts-say-twitter-breach-troubling-undermines-trust-1.24171586,"Experts say Twitter breach troubling, undermines trust",['Zen Soo'],,"HONG KONG — A breach in Twitter’s security that allowed hackers to break into the accounts of leaders and technology moguls is one of the worst attacks in recent years and may shake trust in a platform politicians and CEOs use to communicate with the public, experts said Thursday.

The FBI is investigating the hack, according to a person familiar with the probe who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing probe and spoke on the condition of anonymity Thursday.

article continues below

The ruse discovered Wednesday included bogus tweets from Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Celebrities Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, were also hacked.

Hackers used social engineering to target some of Twitter’s employees and then gained access to the high-profile accounts. The attackers sent out tweets from the accounts of the public figures, offering to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address.

Cybersecurity experts say such a breach could have dire consequences since the attackers were tweeting from verified, globally influential accounts with millions of followers.

""If you receive a tweet from a verified account, belonging to a well-known and therefore trusted person, you can no longer assume it’s really from them,"" said Michael Gazeley, managing director of cybersecurity firm Network Box.

Reacting to the breach, Twitter swiftly deleted the tweets and locked down the accounts to investigate. In the process it prevented verified users from sending out tweets for several hours.

The company said Thursday it has taken ""significant steps to limit access to internal systems and tools.""

Many celebrities, politicians and business leaders often use Twitter as a public platform to make statements. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, regularly uses Twitter to post about national and geopolitical matters, and his account is closely followed by media, analysts and governments around the world.

Twitter faces an uphill battle in regaining people’s confidence, Gazeley said. For a start, it needs to figure out exactly the accounts were hacked and show the vulnerabilities have been fixed, he said.

""If key employees at Twitter were tricked, that’s actually a serious cybersecurity problem in itself,"" he said. ""How can one of the world’s most used social media platforms have such weak security, from a human perspective?""

Rachel Tobac, CEO of Socialproof Security, said that the breach appeared to be largely financially motivated. But such an attack could cause more serious consequences.

""Can you imagine if they had taken over a world leader’s account, and tweeted out a threat of violence to another country’s leader?"" asked Tobac, a social engineering hacker who specializes in providing training for companies to protect themselves from such breaches.

Social engineering attacks typically target human weaknesses to exploit networks and online platforms. Companies can guard themselves against such attacks by beefing up multi-factor authentication -– where users have to present multiple pieces of evidence as authentication before being allowed to log into a system, Tobac said.

Such a process could include having a physical token that an employee must have with them, on top of a password, before they can log into a corporate or other private system. Other methods include installing technical tools to monitor for suspicious insider activities and reducing the number of people who have access to an administrative panel, Tobac said.

Several U.S. lawmakers called on Twitter to co-operate with authorities including the Department of Justice and the FBI to secure the site.

""I am concerned that this event may represent not merely a co-ordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.

He added that millions of users relied on Twitter not just to send tweets but also communicate privately via direct messaging. Twitter hasn't said if hackers were able to access the private messages of their high-profile targets.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told him in a private conversation in 2018 that the company was working on protecting direct messages, known as DMs, with end-to-end encryption.

But that promise never materialized, Wyden said Thursday, leaving everyone's private messages ""vulnerable to employees who abuse their internal access to the company’s systems, and hackers who gain unauthorized access.""

""This is a vulnerability that has lasted for far too long, and one that is not present in other, competing platforms,"" Wyden said in an emailed statement. ""If hackers gained access to users’ DMs, this breach could have a breathtaking impact, for years to come.""

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

article continues below

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

Bangladesh has reopened businesses including its main export-earning garment sector after a monthslong closure.",[]

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

article continues below

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

In an email to workers Wednesday night, the company said that since January it has had fewer than 10 cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 that were transmitted in the workplace.

article continues below

But the email from Laurie Shelby, Tesla’s vice-president of environmental, safety and health, also confirmed reports that Tesla is looking into more than 130 positive tests among employees, including those who contracted the virus outside of Tesla facilities. She said less than 0.25% of employees worldwide have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which equals just over 137 workers.

Her message came in response to a report by Electrek.co that over 130 Tesla employees or contractors have tested positive, and hundreds more are waiting for test results. The website said it based the report on internal company data.

Shelby wrote that the story referred to data ""that was in the process of being validated"" and included employees worldwide who may have been infected but never entered a Tesla site, or were infected at home while Tesla's operations were shut down earlier in the year. A Tesla spokesman would not comment on the report or the email, which was obtained by The Associated Press.

""Nearly all — more than 99.99% — of these occurrences were not cases of virus transmitted at work,"" Shelby wrote in the email. ""Most of the positive cases resulted from an individual living with or travelling with someone with COVID-19 and have returned to work after recovering from home.""

Shelby wrote that Tesla doesn't have any employees in serious condition anywhere in the world because of COVID-19.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the numbers from the public health department in Alameda County, California, which includes Fremont, the location of Tesla's only U.S. assembly plant. The factory employs about 10,000 workers.

Some workers have refused to return to the plant out of fear of catching the virus. They did so after CEO Elon Musk in May defied Health Department orders not to restart production under shutdown orders due to the virus.

Some Tesla workers and labour activists say the company is threatening to fire employees who haven’t returned, but Tesla officials have said claims about firings are not true. Workers say they've heard about COVID-19 cases at the plant but they don't know numbers. They have called on the company and health department to release the figures.

However, Shelby wrote in the email that an employee survey found the vast majority of workers feel comfortable with the safety measures being taken by the company.

Among the measures are increased cleaning, limiting access to facilities, temperature checks for employees before they enter buildings, staggered shifts to keep workers apart, additional barriers between employees and providing protective equipment, Shelby wrote.

She urged workers to wear masks or face coverings to stay healthy and save lives and warned that failing to wear masks where required, or not wearing them properly, will bring disciplinary actions. She also wrote that workers should stay home if they're sick.

Musk reopened the Fremont plant May 11 in defiance of county orders. The health department had deemed the factory a nonessential business that can’t fully open under virus restrictions, but Tesla contended it was essential under federal guidelines.

The next day, however, the Health Department announced that the plant could return to manufacturing as long as it delivers on worker safety precautions that it agreed to.",[]

Asa Hutchinson issued an order Thursday requiring people to wear face masks in public throughout the state, which has had a surge in coronavirus cases over the past several weeks.

The Republican governor had resisted a statewide mask mandate and opposed issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the pandemic, but he signed the order requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible in the hopes of slowing the disease's rapid spread in the state. The order takes effect Monday.

article continues below

Hutchinson’s decision comes amid growing support for mask requirements from business and health leaders and a day after Bentonville-based Walmart said it would require customers to wear masks in all of its U.S. stores. The state’s largest newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, also called for a statewide requirement on Thursday.

Hutchinson previously encouraged people to wear masks and allowed cities to pass ordinances requiring their use, but he stopped short of requiring them statewide. He’s the latest Republican governor to relent on the mask issue in the face of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Alabama's governor issued a similar mask mandate on Wednesday.

Arkansas' coronavirus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen despite warnings from national health officials about the risks of doing so too soon. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that did not issue a broader stay-at-home order that kept most businesses closed.

Hutchinson previously questioned how a mask mandate could be enforced in a rural state such as Arkansas, but this week he left open the possibility of such a requirement. The chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences called for a statewide requirement last weekend.

Hutchinson's order was expected to face criticism from some conservatives in the state. Hours before he issued the order, a Republican legislator urged people to call Hutchinson to oppose any mask directive.

A poll by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business suggested tensions are flaring between workers and employers, with around 27 per cent of 3,389 employers polled indicating some of their laid-off staff have refused to return to work.

article continues below

Of the nearly 870 businesses that provided the reasons their employees gave for refusing to return to work, 62 per cent reported workers ""prefer the Canada Emergency Response Benefit."" Employers could choose more than one explanation for why a worker refused to return, and respondents also selected options such as concern for health (47 per cent), childcare obligations (27 per cent) or lack of hours in return offer (16 per cent).

CFIB president Dan Kelly said it's ""clear"" that CERB ""created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality."" Other sectors where conflicts are arising include child care, dental offices, home health care, amusement parks, gambling and spectator sports, the study suggested.

""CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But Ian Robb, Canadian director of the Unite Here union that represents hospitality workers, disagrees. He said workers are impatient to return to work — for what is usually the lucrative summer season — but employers are the ones failing to adopt measures like frequent cleaning and wage subsidies. The union previously estimated that average wages in cities like Toronto are around $20 per hour for hospitality.

""A number of our members in the U.S. have gone to work and contracted (COVID-19),"" Robb said.

""There's just not enough safety in front of service. Nobody wants to stay home and make two grand when they can make double that by working.""

The survey suggested that the hospitality sector had the biggest share of employers, 45 per cent, who had trouble recalling workers. CFIB defines hospitality as including hotels, restaurants and bars.

The CFIB study suggests that in the hospitality sector, 56 per cent of hard-to-fill positions were ""unskilled, entry-level jobs"" that pay ""at or around minimum wage,"" although across sectors, skilled and semi-skilled jobs were harder to fill.

Employment and human rights lawyer Neena Gupta says she has heard of tradespeople unable to perform jobs because workers failed to return.

She said the reason an employee is refusing the work matters. Lack of childcare, like daycare and camps, can be a job-protected reason for staying home, as can disabilities such as being immunocompromised, says Gupta, a partner in Gowling WLG's Waterloo Region and Toronto offices.

The federal government's website states that workers seeking CERB, which offers $500 per week over a limited period, ""should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so."" The government's COVID-19 guidelines also provide for employees to refuse to do a dangerous job, although the worker must already ""be at work"" to refuse such a task.

However, notes Gupta, general apprehension about the pandemic is likely not enough to merit a job refusal. She said workplaces must comply with health and safety guidelines, and that a ministry inspection must find some sort of violation to justify a job refusal.

Managers should give workers a written ""come back to work"" recall and an indication that it will be treated as job abandonment if the worker doesn't return, says Gupta. After that process is completed, the employer could consider that worker terminated for cause, and hire a replacement.

While reporting misuse of CERB by a former employee might appear to give an employer some moral satisfaction, Gupta says it’s unlikely to help with staffing concerns or worker morale.

""I do ask people to be reasonable. You can’t call someone at noon on a Thursday and expect them in at 7 a.m. on Friday,"" she says.

The arts council is hosting two live events this weekend – its first since the COVID-19 pandemic saw the annual Luminescence exhibition cancelled in March.

article continues below

On Saturday, June 20, from 2 to 4 p.m., visitors can enjoy a Live at the Gallery performance in the gallery’s backyard, and from 3 to 5 p.m., there’s an outdoor painting event.

“With concerts and gigs cancelled, performance halls closed, musicians will be facing a challenging year,” a gallery event notice says. “So to keep uplifting local artists, we’re bringing our Live at the Gallery series outdoors for the time being. You can still enjoy live music, get some fresh air, and support local artists, all at the same time.”

The gallery suggests people set up a picnic on the Deer Lake Park lawn to listen to the music, or add the gallery to their running and walking route.

Anyone who wants to stay on site and listen is asked to be mindful of others around them and maintain the recommended two-metre distance. The gallery also asks people to wear masks, if possible.

The Live at the Gallery gig will feature two singer-songwriters: Carmina Bolinao and Zayda. Bolinao is a Vancouver-based singer who’s heavily inspired by old-school R&B, with a touch of jazz. Zayda is a modern folk-pop singer-songwriter, who offers up both original music and covers combining elements of her favourite genres.

For full details of the performances, check out the Live at the Gallery: Outdoor edition event listing on Facebook.

The outdoor painting session will be led by Burnaby Arts Council board member Farhad Sadhegi Amini. The gallery will be spacing out easels to ensure people are a minimum of six feet apart, and the session will be limited to 10 people.

If more people sign up, the gallery will start a wait list; if there’s significant interest, the arts council says it will consider hosting another session.

Bring your preferred art supplies, and the gallery will also provide painting materials.

For nearly 40 years, the Burnaby Art Gallery and the Burnaby school district have been teaming up on an annual exhibition of student artwork, called Arts Alive.

article continues below

This year, with the gallery unable to host an exhibition in person, the two groups worked together to take it online instead. Art teachers at all eight of the district’s high schools worked with the gallery to create this year’s virtual exhibition.

Thanks to those efforts, Arts Alive 2020 is now online at the Burnaby Art Gallery website, featuring 50 pieces of art from students in grades 8 through 12.

“We’re so proud of these talented students,” said school board chair Gary Wong in a press release. “The entire board is grateful to the gallery and district staff for their creative thinking to find a way to maintain our annual tradition during these unusual times and to publicly celebrate these incredible works of student art.”

Christina Froschauer, fine arts programmer for the gallery, said teachers, students, volunteers and administrators put a great deal of time and effort into the exhibition every year.

“We are elated that the exhibition could be featured online for everyone to enjoy, alongside an Arts Alive art activity – a new way for teachers and students to engage with the artwork,” she said.

That activity guide, which is available online, leads students through the elements of composition and asks them to consider those elements in relation to any piece of art in the exhibition. Then it asks them to create their own mixed-media work in response to the chosen artwork and share it on social media.

“Burnaby students are brimming with artistic talent; we are fortunate to feature student artwork for the past 38 years,” Froschauer said.

Christopher Auchter’s documentary Now Is The Time will go live on the National Film Board’s website on June 21.

The 16-minute NFB documentary revisits a momentous occasion from 1969, when the Haida village of Masset, on Haida Gwaii, raised its first totem pole in more than a century.

In recognition of the 50th anniversary of the pole’s raising, Auchter’s film features an interview with renowned Haida carver Robert Davidson, who was just 22 years old when he carved the pole. The film uses first-hand accounts from Davidson and his younger brother, Reg (whom Davidson paid to help with the carving), as well as Haida scholar Barbara Wilson. Courtesy of a deep dive into both the National Film Board archives and the B.C. Archives, it also incorporates the voices of Haida elders.

Filmmaker Christopher Auchter of Burnaby. - Tracy Auchter, contributed

Auchter, in researching the film, came to see that totem pole raising as a turning point for Haida culture. Before then, traditional culture - including language, dance, dress and ceremonial traditions – had been all but eradicated.

After that momentous day, it began to blossom again.

“It seemed like it was pointing to this pole-raising being a pivotal moment of it all,” Auchter said in a previous interview with the NOW. “It was the deliberate act that made it something people could turn to.”

Now Is The Time has been a success on the film festival circuit, becoming an official selection at numerous international festivals, including Toronto, Vancouver, New Zealand’s Maoriland Film Festival and the prestigious Sundance Film Festival in Utah.

Starting June 21, audiences around the world will be able to access it for streaming, free of charge, at www.nfb.ca.

Metro Vancouver has extended the usual process for its regional cultural grants, in recognition of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the arts community.

Arts and culture organizations now have until Tuesday, Aug. 4 to apply for 2020 grants, rather than the usual spring timeline.

A Metro Vancouver press release notes that a total of $140,000 in funding is available to arts and culture organizations for regional projects, with a maximum of $10,000 per project grant. These annual regional cultural grants support arts and culture projects including research, creation, production, dissemination, audience development, project staff and administrative capacity building.

The release notes this year’s application deadline was extended to give applicants more time to focus on their base operations, brainstorm adapted methods of project delivery and “reconfirm the availability of necessary resources.”

“The arts community is facing unprecedented challenges due to the ongoing public health measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Sav Dhaliwal, chair of the Metro Vancouver board of directors, in a press release.

“As such, we have adjusted this year’s cultural grants program to offer greater clarity and flexibility in terms of project delivery options, timeframes and other grant criteria.

“Arts and culture connect our communities in important and creative ways that are the heart and soul of the quality of life that we all value so much, and we are proud to support the arts and culture community during this difficult period.”

Completed applications must be submitted by 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 4.

A cracked bone? Good to go. What about a sore shoulder? No problem.

article continues below

It's well-known NHLers battle through aches, pains and even illness. Almost like clockwork, a flu bug tears through more than a few locker rooms every season. Players often attempt to soldier on without missing any time, especially when the games matter most.

In the era of COVID-19, however, some of that old the definition of ""toughness"" is being thrown out the window.

Players and coaches are keenly aware that if they're feeling even the slightest bit off — and there are a laundry list of symptoms associated with the novel coronavirus, from chills to headaches to fatigue and weakness — it needs to be reported immediately.

""Doesn't matter if you're a tough hockey player or not,"" said Tippett, now the head coach of the Edmonton Oilers. ""I had a lot of games where I hid a broken finger or something like that from doctors. I didn't want them to know because they wouldn't let me play.

""But when you get sick, you're going to have to tell people. That's just the way of the new world.""

The NHL opened training camps this week as part of its plan to kickstart a campaign that was suspended in mid-March by the pandemic. Players and staff are getting tested every 48 hours — they're not currently quarantined — and that will be kick up another notch to once a day when the 24 teams involved in the resumption head to the hub cities of Edmonton and Toronto, where they'll be kept in a bubble separate from the general public.

Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said the mentality of the past has been turned on its head when it comes to illness.

""As hockey players you want to be in every single game, you want to play, and you want to help your teammate, and you want to be a difference-maker,"" he said. ""Before you played through colds, you played through injuries, you played through sickness and stuff like that.

""You have to step back and think a little bit now. It's a different animal, this virus. You have to be not only cautious of yourself and how you're feeling, but the people around you, too. It's not just your teammates, it's the medical staff, it's the trainers, it's everybody you're around every single day, and even obviously opposing teams. You've got to think of everybody. You've got to be very cautious.""

Edmonton Oilers centre and NHL leading scorer Leon Draisaitl said that caution is going to become the new norm.

""Every hockey player has played through certain things and we've all played through a flu or sickness or whatever it is,"" he said. ""But now with this going around, it makes it a little more dangerous.

""You have to be careful.""

Winnipeg Jets centre Andrew Copp said hockey's team-first mentality should kick in if someone isn't feeling right.

""You hope that everyone's pretty dialled in, and not only for everyone's health and safety, but for the team too,"" he said. ""If this guy gets it, he's not playing. Hopefully everyone can realize that we're all making a lot of sacrifices here.""

The NHL hasn't said how many positive tests would constitute the ""uncontrolled outbreak"" listed in its return-to-play protocol that could conceivably shut the league's resumption down. There's a difference between cases being spread out and a cluster of infections on a team or teams.

The league said earlier this week 30 players tested positive for COVID-19 during voluntary workouts at team facilities between June 8 and July 12. Another 13 positive results came outside of the league's protocol, while 10 other players tested positive in the spring. Training camps opened Monday, but individuals and teams won't be named moving forward with regards to positive tests.

It's no secret players have hid countless injuries in the past, and the league has been criticized heavily for how it dealt with the concussion issue, but Mathieu Schneider, special assistant to NHLPA executive director Don Fehr, said the virus is different territory.

""If concussions were contagious, I think players would feel differently about it,"" Schneider said. ""Guys certainly understand the notion that if they are not honest with symptoms or how they might feel, that they put their entire team in jeopardy.

""There's going to be a huge onus on the players here in (training camp) to make sure that they're taking care of themselves and looking out for their teammates — going to the rink, going home, going to the grocery store, social distancing, wearing mask, washing your hands. All the things that all of us are practising every single day now.""

Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly said it simply comes down to common sense is in this new reality.

""It's on the players and our staff to be honest with each other,"" he said. ""You don't want to put anyone else at risk.

""You want to do what's best for them.""

Matthews finished third in the NHL with a career-high 47 goals, one behind Maurice (Rocket) Richard Trophy co-winners Alex Ovechkin and David Pastrnak, while also topping the Maple Leafs with a career-best 80 points in 70 games.

The 22-year-old Scottsdale, Ariz., native also established a career-low with eight penalty minutes, tied for the fewest among the NHL's top 100 scorers. He did so while sharing second place in the League in takeaways (78) and ranking eighth among NHL forwards in total time on ice (1,467 minutes 52 seconds).

MacKinnon ranked fifth in the NHL with 93 points (35 goals, 58 assists) in 69 games to lead the Avalanche into the playoffs for the third consecutive season. The 24-year-old from Cole Harbour, N.S., registered a career-low 12 penalty minutes, the second-fewest among the league's top 25 scorers.

Ryan entered the NHL/NHLPA Players' Assistance program on Nov. 20 to get help for alcohol addiction. After going public with his story in an effort to help others with addiction issues, an emotional Ryan returned to the ice Feb. 27 and scored three times in a 5-2 win over visiting Vancouver.

Lindblom was diagnosed in December with Ewing's sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that grows in the bones or in the tissue around bones. He completed radiation treatments on July 2.

The rising star had 11 goals and 18 points in 30 games this season. While he has recently skated at the Flyers' complex in Voorhees, New Jersey, he has been ruled out of playing when the NHL season resumes.

Johns missed all of last season and the first 47 games of this one with painful headaches due to post-concussion syndrome. He scored four games into his return on Feb. 3 against the Rangers, with his parents in attendance at Madison Square Garden.

The 18-year veteran quarterback headlines the Canadian Football Hall of Fame's 2020 class that was unveiled Thursday. Burris, 45, got the nod in his first year of eligibility, becoming just the 21st player ever to do so but second in as many years after Calgary running back Jon Cornish in 2019.

article continues below

Joining Burris in the player category are offensive linemen Clyde Brock and Freddie Childress and quarterback Greg Vavra. John Hufnagel, the Calgary Stampeders president/GM, and Larry Uteck (posthumously), the former head coach/athletic director at Saint Mary’s University, were both named as builders.

Burris's family — wife Nicole and sons Armand and Barron — had known of his induction since February but managed to keep quiet about it until about two and a half weeks ago when the Hall of Fame informed Burris. Even then, the Burris clan was very nonchalant in asking the former quarterback to take in what he thought was a run-of-the-mill video.

Instead, Burris watched Hall of Famer Damon Allen (2012) outline his pro football journey to Canada, which drew a rather bewildered look from Burris. Then Allen detailed Burris's stellar CFL career before Mark DeNobile, the Hall of Fame's executive director, delivered the big news.

And the player, affectionately dubbed Smilin' Hank because of his outgoing personality, was lost for words as tears streamed down his face.

""Yeah, they got me good,"" Burris said with a chuckle. ""What's funny is whenever I've told the boys to keep anything quiet, they've always gone back to their mother and yet they didn't say a peep about this.

""I was lost for words just because to hear it shows you that people appreciated the things you did throughout your career. This is the way for the league and all the organizations and the fans saying, 'Thank you,' and for me I'm humbled by it . . . there's so many guys in there (Hall of Fame) who I looked up to and now to be able to join them is a dream come true.""

The six-foot-one, 190-pound Burris, a native of Spiro, Okla., played 20 pro seasons, 18 in the CFL with the Calgary Stampeders (1997-99, 2005-11), Saskatchewan Roughriders (2000, 2003-04), Hamilton Tiger-Cats (2012-13) and Ottawa Redblacks (2014-16). Burris also spent time with the NFL's Green Bay Packers (2001) and Chicago Bears (2002).

Burris appeared in five Grey Cups, winning three (1998, '08, '16) and being named the MVP twice (2008, '16). The CFL's outstanding player on two occasions (2010, 2015), Burris amassed 63,639 passing yards and 373 TD passes — both third all-time.

Burris retired shortly after leading Ottawa to a thrilling 39-33 overtime Grey Cup upset win over Calgary. He threw for 461 yards and three TDs despite suffering a knee injury during warmups.

Burris said his Hall of Fame induction is as much a testament to his family's resilience and perseverance as it is his on-field accomplishments.

""I had to take my wife all over Canada, drag my kids all over Canada and force them to make new friends just for dad to be able to play this game called football,"" said Burris, whose family still calls Ottawa home. ""And for them to understand and see just the emotions that ran through me . . . it just shows how big that moment is, just kind of when your whole life flashes before you.""

Burris and the other inductees will have to wait for their day in the sun due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 class will be honoured alongside the 2021 inductees next August.

When Burris is formally honoured, he'll be joined by former teammate Childress and Hufnagel, who served as Calgary's head coach (2008-2015) before moving into the front office full-time. Burris won Grey Cups with both ('98 with Childress, '08 with Hufnagel).

""Calgary is a machine right now and it all started in 2008 when Huf came in and we got that Grey Cup in his first year,"" Burris said. ""Calgary has always had double-digit wins and been in the playoffs each and every year Huf has been there, they've always been a strong contender for the Grey Cup and there's one reason why.""

Hufnagel, a 68-year-old native of Coraopolis, Pa., spent 12 seasons as a CFL quarterback with Calgary (1976-79), Saskatchewan (1980-83, 1987) and Winnipeg (1984-86) before getting into coaching. A five-time Grey Cup champion, Hufnagel also earned a Super Bowl ring as an assistant with the New England Patriots (2003).

Hufnagel amassed a 102-42-1 record as Calgary's head coach, his .712 win percentage being the highest among coaches with more than 100 games. He's been named the CFL's coach of the year twice (2008, 2014).

Childress, a 53-year-old native of Little Rock, Ark., played 13 CFL seasons with Shreveport (1994), Birmingham (1995), Calgary (1996-03) and Saskatchewan (2004-06). A former second-round pick of the NFL's New England Patriots, Childress won two Grey Cups with the Stampeders (1998, 2001) and in 1998 was named the CFL's top offensive lineman.

Brock, 79, of Los Angeles, played 12 seasons with Saskatchewan (1964-75), helping the club win its first Grey Cup in 1966. The former Dallas Cowboy-San Francisco 49er appeared in 169 regular-season CFL games and four times was named a league all-star before being inducted into Saskatchewan's Plaza of Honour in 1995.

Vavra, 59, of Red Deer, Alta., helped the Calgary Dinos win the Vanier Cup in 1983, his final season at the school. That year, he also became the first player in the program's history to capture the Hec Crighton Trophy as Canadian university football's top player and still holds the U Sports record for most passing yards in a game (627).

Vavra was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in 1984 and also spent time with the B.C. Lions (1986-87) and Edmonton Eskimos (1988).

After playing seven CFL seasons as a defensive back with Toronto (1974-76), B.C. (1977), Montreal (1978-80) and Ottawa (1980), Uteck became an assistant coach at Saint Mary’s University in 1982. He was promoted to head coach the following year, a position he held until 1997.

Over that span, Uteck was named the Atlantic University Athletic Association coach of the year five times and twice Canadian university football's top coach.

Uteck served as athletic director from 1995 to 2002 and the Huskies captured two Vanier Cups (2001-02). The native of Thornhill, Ont., passed away Dec. 25, 2002 of Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 50.

The Atlantic Bowl was renamed the Uteck Bowl in 2003.

The metaphor suggested by the title of Christian Sands’ new album is apt.

article continues below

The jazz pianist says he was trying to be freer and more flexible on ""Be Water,"" and it shows. The set's 10 cuts explore a wide range of moods and instrumental combinations, with Sands' trio at the core.

Much of the material is built on the same pattern of tension and release found in a body of water. That begins with the opening ""Intro,"" which settles on the tonic chord after nearly four minutes of shimmering undulation.

The reflective ""Still,"" featuring Marvin Sewell on acoustic guitar, rides a mere ripple of rhythm. On ""Be Water II,"" a string quartet plays against the lapping beat established by Sands' piano. Marcus Strickland's woodwind work makes ""Drive"" swing as it crests with a cascading electric guitar solo by Sewell.

Sands rarely cuts loose at the piano — his objective isn't to be splashy — but he takes an active role as the producer, overdubbing extra keyboards and including sound effects and brief recitations by martial artist Bruce Lee. ""Water can flow, or it can crash,"" Lee says. Forgive the flood of puns, but ""Be Water"" flows freely.",[]

Everything about this album is intimidating, including the growling, nether-worldly voice of singer Udo Dirkschneider, and the fact that his backing band is the official concert band of the German military. This album is not for the faint of heart.

The former Accept frontman's solo band U.D.O. teams with the Musikkorps der Bundeswehr to put some real metal in heavy metal on ""We Are One.""

The pairing has undeniable power and force on 15 tracks that deal with environmental threats to the planet (""Future Is the Reason Why"", ""Mother Earth""), the refugee crisis (""Children of the World""), and a reunited Germany (""Rebel Town""), among other topics. The band lends a sweeping grandeur to most of the tracks with horns and strings punching up already-rowdy guitar riffs.

And for those who still miss the diminutive singer's 1980s heyday with Accept, U.D.O. throws them a bone in ""We Strike Back,"" a close cousin of the classic Accept concert opener ""Fast as a Shark,"" with very similar speed, style and structure, right down to the harmonic twin guitar solos.

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro's column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday's newspaper.

article continues below

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, ""has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.""

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check story by Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro's claims.

It wasn't clear how Navarro's column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he's letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last month that an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn't been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor.

Navarro did not immediately return a message for comment.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro's opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci ""a national treasure.""

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint ""shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.""

It wasn't clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he's publicly been more pessimistic than the president. He does webcasts but rarely gives television interviews anymore.

Trump distanced himself from Navarro's column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro's views and ""he shouldn't be doing that.""

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that ""might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives."" USA Today said there isn't enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

The Burnaby resident will cap it the same way, as only the third female to be inducted as an individual player in the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in New Westminster.

article continues below

Bowyer is already n there as a member of the 1982-’93 B.C. Selects.

Bowyer, who recently retired from her career as a probation officer based out of the Justice Institute in New West, was a charter member of the first girls’ box lacrosse team in Port Coquitlam in 1972, when she was 15 years old.

Having already played ice hockey, basketball and baseball, it wasn’t until Bowyer picked up a lacrosse stick that she felt an immediate, almost primal, connection to a sport.

“It was in my soul,” she said. “You felt a bit like a gladiator when you played.”

Bowyer said she loved the camaraderie that quickly developed with her teammates as they learned a new sport together and forged rivalries with teams in Coquitlam, Burnaby, North Vancouver and White Rock.

“We were good athletes, but we weren’t lacrosse players,” she said. “If you practised hard, you felt like you could be anything you wanted to be.”

But it was a sideways compliment after a game that she “played like a boy” that most affirmed her affection for lacrosse.

“It brought me out of my shell,” she said. “It was so invigorating.”

Seeking to elevate her play, Bowyer migrated to the Kirby’s Klipettes out of Burnaby that was coached by former pro, and future Hall of Famer, Dave Evans. The team won league, provincial and national championships.

“There was no going back after that,” Bowyer said.

But there was going outside.

In 1980, Bowyer discovered field lacrosse.

At first, the shallow basket on the stick and lack of body contact felt foreign to her, but she said she loved the ability to run up and down the expansive field in the open air from her position as a midfielder.

With the newly-formed B.C. Selects, Bowyer travelled across Canada and down to the United States to play in tournaments. She captained the team to 11 straight Canadian championships from 1982 to ’93. In fact, the team was so good, in 2014, it was the first female squad inducted into the Hall of Fame.

Bowyer also represented Canada at three world championships, in England in 1982, Philadelphia in “86 and Perth, Australia, in ’89.

A fractured vertebrae suffered in a ball hockey game ended Bowyer’s playing career after that, but she quickly transitioned into coaching at the provincial and national level.

Bowyer said she hopes her induction into the Hall of Fame will serve as a touchstone for other young women in the sport to show them what they can achieve, something she never had.

And while part of her regrets not being a decade or two younger so she could have enjoyed the scholarship opportunities that started emerging through the 1980s to play and get an education at big time American universities, she takes pride in having laid the groundwork for the young women who’ve followed in her wake.

It wasn’t easy, Bowyer said, as funding at the time was non-existent and every trip to a tournament or championship had to be earned not only on the floor or field but with countless hours washing cars or selling t-shirts.

“It makes you feel good that we worked as hard as we did,” she said. “I wouldn’t change a thing.”

A month after the BC Junior A Lacrosse League was supposed to begin playing, the league officially cancelled its 2020 season.

The Minto Cup, along with all other minor and senior national championships, has also been cancelled by the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

In a release, BCJALL president Karl Christiansen said ongoing restrictions in British Columbia limiting the size of public gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic to no more than 50 people made it impossible for games to be played.

“We had hope we might be able to compete this year,” he said. “But it became evident we wouldn’t be able to have a normal season.”

Christiansen said alternative schedules were considered, but public health directives were insurmountable.

CLA president Shawn Williams said health and safety, travel concerns and venue closures were the main considerations in its decision to cancel all 2020 national championships from the Mann Cup senior men’s title to the U12 finals, as well as the U19 women’s field lacrosse championships.

“We recognize that national championships are important to lacrosse players of all ages,” he said, adding all hosts for 2020 events will be charged with staging their championships in 2021. That means the Minto and Mann Cups will both be played in Ontario.

The Burnaby Winter Club, which owns a facility on Canada Way, suspended its operations earlier this spring due to the COVID-19 pandemic following an order from Fraser Health’s chief medical officer Dr. Martin Lavoie to close all gyms and fitness facilities.

“During this closure, we have been doing as many repairs and maintenance at the club as possible so to avoid closures when we do open,” reads a letter sent to members.

The closure order is in place until May 31, but according to the letter, the Burnaby Winter Club has been given the go-ahead from Fraser Health to reopen under an agreed-upon operating plan with strict requirements on physical distancing, cleaning and disinfecting.

But Paul Dal Monte said the league’s executive and governors are doing everything they can to ensure that doesn’t happen, even as the uncertainty about when restrictions on public gatherings could be lifted continues.

article continues below

At the very least, the coming season - which has already been postponed from its scheduled May 21 start - is unlikely to look like any other normal campaign.

Dal Monte said the league has a contingency to play a schedule as short as 12 games. But any decision on how to proceed relies on continuing direction from health authorities, as well as the Canadian Lacrosse Association.

Dal Monte added he’s also in regular communication with his counterpart at Major Series Lacrosse in Ontario, which is supposed to be hosting the Mann Cup national championship in September.

“We stay on top of things,” Dal Monte said. “We understand the pain points and challenges.”

One of those pain points is the financial viability of the league and its seven teams, including the Coquitlam Adanacs, Burnaby Lakers and New Westminster Salmonbellies.

Dal Monte said the niche nature of lacrosse means teams rely on sponsors and partnerships rather than gate receipts to cover expenses, and with so many businesses suffering because of the pandemic, those dollars may be hard to come by this summer.

“At this stage, it creates a significant obstacle for us and many of our teams,” he said, adding without the certainty of a schedule, it’s difficult for teams to even begin having a conversation with potential sponsors.

Dal Monte conceded some teams might have a hard time operating.

Still, he said, time is on the league’s side. Virtual meetings with team governors are being held May 2 and 16 to assess the current situation and options for moving forward.

Any final call on how to proceed with a season could be held off as late as June 1, Dal Monte said. Then “we would have to make a decision one way or the other.”

Meanwhile, the president of the BC Junior A Lacrosse League said a recent pronouncement by British Columbia’s health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, suggesting large gatherings of people may not be allowed through the summer in an effort to quash transmission of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 puts his league’s ability to hold a season “at risk.”

The BCJALL, which includes the Coquitlam Jr. Adanacs, PoCo Saints as well as junior incarnations of the Lakers and Salmonbellies among its eight teams, was supposed to play its first regular season game on Saturday. But that’s now on hold with the league executive meeting next on May 19.

Karl Kristiansen said the league could reduce its schedule to 14 games from 21, or even stage a tournament-style season to determine playoff teams that could compete for a chance to go to the Minto Cup in St. Catharines in August. That is, if the national championship even gets the green light to play.

Kristiansen said his group should have more clarity after the CLA meets May 15 when the fate of several national championships, from youth to senior leagues, is expected to be decided.

On the day Finance Minister Carol James announced a $12.5 billion deficit, the combined effect of an economic meltdown and $6.26 billion in supports to date, a polling company released details of a huge jump in approval ratings for how the B.C. government has stick-handled the pandemic.

article continues below

Meanwhile, the BC Liberals are weighing in with a hefty criticism of the government’s economic recovery plan, and trying to get their voices heard above the fray.

In a press release issued today Wednesday, Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson stated that under the BC NDP-government’s watch, the province has amassed the largest deficit in British Columbia’s modern history.

He contends that this year’s deficit has increased by 27.6%, or $2,643 for every British Columbian, while household incomes are estimated to fall by approximately 3.9% in 2020.

James, however, maintains that B.C.’s safe restart plan is “creating signs of hope for our economy as consumer confidence increases.”

Wilkinsons argues the economic recovery plan is lacking because “there will be no change in the government spending priorities” and the strategy is “simply unsustainable.”

Source: Insights West Graphic

Still, the Insights West poll suggests the government has got a lot of wriggle room in its appeal to British Columbians, noting that the BC NDP has approved its rating during the pandemic, with Premier Horgan himself ratcheting up his approval rating by 17% to 68%, “a higher level higher than for any political leader in B.C. since tracking began 8 years ago.”

Meanwhile, Insights West said its online poll — which ran from June 24-28 among 830 B.C. residents — shows opposition parties are having a difficult time catching the attention of B.C. voters.

The poll found Wilkinson’s approval rating has dropped five points since November to 30%. Interim Green leader Adam Olsen has made his debut at a 29% approval rating — the lowest of any Green leader since the 2017 election, and 44% of B.C. residents don’t know enough about him to provide a rating. Trevor Bolin from the BC Conservative Party, meanwhile, has an 18% approval rating, but similarly, 49% of British Columbians didn’t know enough about him to provide a rating.

Insights Wests notes that approval of the government’s response to the pandemic has improved its ratings overall.

For example, 85% think it has done a good job on combating COVID-19, 84% for providing info about the pandemic, 79% for phase 2 and phase 3 re-opening of the economy, and 69% for the financial support for people impacted from COVID-19.

However, a closer reading shows a dip in areas where B.C. residents are “typically more negative than positive towards the BC NDP’s handling of certain issues, such as housing and affordability, down nine points, and homelessness down 13%.",[]

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

The two developments, both from Blue Sky Properties, are connected by a tower of rentals set to be built on Kathleen Avenue in Metrotown. The main rezoning application, focusing on the 5900-block of Kathleen Avenue, involves a proposed 34-storey building that would include 230 market rentals and 94 non-market units.

article continues below

Of those 94 non-market units, 66 are related to a proposed development at 5977 Wilson Ave., where Blue Sky is looking to build a 42-storey, 356-unit market condo development. The Wilson Avenue development had gone through the public hearing process, but shortly before it was set for final approval, it was sent back to the drawing board as the city developed its new rental zoning policy.

That policy requires developers to replace any existing rentals torn down for new developments or make 20% of the new units non-market rentals, whichever is higher. Occupants of torn-down rentals must also be offered a unit in the new development at the same rent plus provincially allowed annual increases.

The Wilson Avenue development saw 14 letters weighing in, along with seven speakers, some of whom were also among the letter-writers.

Among those in opposition, Earl Thomas Pollitt wrote that the construction would adversely affect his voice-over business on the same street. Staff responded to Pollitt by noting the construction would need to comply with the noise abatement bylaw, according to the minutes from the June 23 public hearing.

Hannah Weibe expressed concerns around declining property values in the area resulting from the developments, as well as the effects of density on light and noise pollution and strains on public transit and other infrastructure.

The Kathleen Avenue site, however, currently holds single-family houses and undeveloped land, and the proposal to replace those with a tower didn’t sit well with everyone. Six letters and a petition containing 99 signatures were sent to council on that project.

The letters regarding the Kathleen Avenue site largely reflect the same arguments around the Wilson Avenue site, including potential traffic and other infrastructure strain and noise from construction. One letter-writer, Reinhard Schauer, pointed to the city’s Metrotown plan, which calls for Central Park East to include more gentle density to “respect the neighbourhood’s park-side nature.”

Coun. Colleen Jordan, too, spoke out against the development in the July 6 council meeting, during which council gave the rezonings second reading.

She noted the city owns several properties along Kathleen Avenue and had intended on buying more in the past to consolidate the properties and “do something special” with the street.

“It’s been talked about in many discussions about consolidating with other properties across the street and across the back,” Jordan said, “but nothing has ever come forward in a substantive way to develop the whole block.”

She quoted the petition that was delivered to council, which said the development is “not only bad for our street, it’s bad for Metrotown, it’s bad for the people who, in the future, will live in this cramped ghetto.”

Letter-writers pointed to the sharp density of the development, which packs 34 storeys onto a relatively small lot, an argument Jordan amplified in council.

“It’s an easy way out for the developer to take a huge amount of density, transfer it from his Wilson Avenue site to this one,” she said. “This site will have a total floor-area ratio of 11.67. It will be almost twice what is the usual floor area in the Metrotown plan. … I think it’s setting a horrible precedent.”

The petition also notes the development of Kathleen Avenue should take a “holistic” approach that would incorporate the entire block, rather than piecemeal work through individual rezonings.

The developments passed second reading at the July 6 council meeting, with only Jordan and Coun. Dan Johnston opposed, and still require third reading and final approval.

I ride in the SkyTrain and cannot have a cell conversation, or listen consistently to anything.

article continues below

It is incredibly loud - worse for riders right by the noise. If someone needs to talk to me via phone call, I have to exit and go outside on the street to return a call.

That also is difficult further from the trains. It's common to communicate while commuting. Yes, texts can be done due to excessive noise, but this noise is grating on the ears and people tend to talk even louder on the train to compensate.

Noise pollution is added stress while going to work. Nerves are affected in hearing areas of the brain, which does not assist anyone in staying calm or relaxed during the ride. Added to this tension, there are Covid rules being disregarded in all kinds of ways.

People have to tell others to move away. Thousands of repetitions of keep social distance and it still has not become understood that means you need to show patience, notice if you are too close. It's not helpful that the trains only stop for the usual amount of time.

That causes crowding at doors going in or out of trains. It is all kinds of added stressors. Not a lot of changes have been put in place to make more time for doing spacing properly.

Train attendants stand around saying nothing. Could it be everyone has got minor hearing loss? There seems to be less thinking about the system and its operation. Not noticing louder noise, or how people don’t follow simple logic of spacing their bodies apart, I wonder why awareness has taken a back seat. Translink states it offers quality of service via its transportation service.

At stations, new signage and barriers are erected to direct rules and the flow of lines. Maintenance crews attend to lights and escalators, cleaning at the stations. These are necessary actions. But between stations, the experience is not as much quality.

Isn’t that part, part of the overall quality?

Attendants rarely ride on the trains. I am not sure what they are really getting paid for. They are paid for responding to deviance or worse issues of less cooperative riders. What about the majority that rides and acts properly, causing no concerns? We do want some positive response to noted issues. Action by Translink needs to be reflective of their quality mandates, not they tried to fix the tracks.

What about upper administration riding trains for 1 week? They would understand what riders have been saying to their departments for months. Does Translink care about its services or its assets? I do applaud some dedicated train/Translink staff who are responsive to concerns I have had. Myself and others are listening for responses of action to prove that their mission statement is about quality.

Also noted at Metrotown station, there is huge screeching that is constant. I have to cover my ears every time. There are also several construction sites making loud noise beside that station and others. Technologies are all the rage, yet don’t seem be applied to real issues that are causing negative effects. Corporate deafness is not a position Translink can justify.

Surely they enjoy quiet offices and staff are not permitted to have music or conversations above a certain noise level. It's time to be aware of actual feedback from riders, and to recall their own concerns about ridership decreases. Translink has resources to do improvements now. Saving for further developments ought to be suspended in light of harmful effects that are not being addressed.

361,burnabynow,http://www.burnabynow.com/business/burnaby-malls-need-a-food-revolution-to-survive-1.24170357,Burnaby malls need a 'food revolution' to survive,['Chris Campbell'],,"The COVID-19 pandemic has sent unprecedented shockwaves through the global retail industry with devastating effects.

As retailers and mall owners in Burnaby grapple with the repercussions of the pandemic, many are accelerating their business plans, rapidly experimenting with new business models and expanding innovative thinking to find ways to keep malls relevant in the new normal and into the future.

article continues below

According to The future of the mall: Building a new kind of destination for the post-pandemic world, there are five critical changes that mall landlords, retailers, and the entire industry must embrace to protect the sector and keep Canadians coming back into stores.

“Now more than ever, landlords and retailers need to work hand in hand in an effort to get ahead of the evolving trends andcreate a reason for Canadian consumers to return to in-store shopping post-pandemic and have a smooth, stress-free experience,” said Marty Weintraub, partner and national retail leader at Deloitte Canada. “The mall of the future will be a destination that feeds the functional requirements of our lives as well as our need to be social. It will be a thriving community where people will live, work, play, and eat. It will not be your parents’ mall — so much so that we may no longer call it a “mall” at all.”

According to Weintraub, mall owners and retailers need to invest in these five key changes in order to survive and thrive in the post-pandemic world and get Canadians coming back in store:

Focus on safety and convenience: The new mall will need to carefully balance consumers’ desire for social interaction with their need for a safe, easy shopping experience. Retailers and landlords need to address customers’ concerns by finding innovative ways to adjust how they organize their stores, interact with customers, collect payment, and deliver products. The key to getting people back into malls will be for owners and retailers to work together to invest in customer safety, and to provide tools and applications that make for a smoother, more convenient shopping experience.

Rethink the role of the store: Given mall foot traffic had fallen by 22 percent in the country’s top 10 malls even before the COVID-19 outbreak (2019 vs. 2018), retailers need to reconsider the size and number of stores that will meet their customers’ needs, eliminating poorer-performing stores and focusing on showroom, pop-up locations, and other innovative formats. The growth of online shopping (with 78 percent of consumers expecting online shopping to increase in popularity post-pandemic) calls into question the need for an extensive network of stores. Consumers will no longer come in just to browse; they will arrive already knowing what they want, and the associate’s role will be to facilitate the purchase through an exceptional customer experience.

Make way for the food revolution: As less relevant fashion retailers move out of mall locations, their departure will make room for landlords to bring in an exciting new breed of restaurant offerings. This will feed the consumer’s desire for social experience and will likely become the new anchor bringing visitors to the mall. As a social experience, dining out appeals to all customer segments—and it cannot be replicated online. Smart mall owners are viewing food and beverage venues as the new anchor that will enhance their destination appeal. When it comes to the experience of food choices in the mall, a renaissance is coming.

Embrace technology: Retailers need to take a page from digital-first companies—it’s never been more important to build a seamless and integrated physical and digital brand presence. Customers are increasingly looking for a digitized experience both online and off, enabled by technological innovation at every turn. Malls and retailers need to use digital tools to maximize productivity and efficiency and create a dynamic, engaging experience, such as product testing and simulation using AR and VR technologies, an “endless-aisle” distribution strategy that can deliver in 24 hours or less, pop-up shops to showcase new products both in person and online, as well as online concierge services, digitized browsing, and virtual fitting rooms.

Become a new destination: Most of all, the mall must become the new meeting place for the community—a multi-purpose destination that offers extensive leisure activities as well as other functions, like office, residential, and cultural amenities. Shops should be mixed in with other complementary uses, giving visitors an interactive experience in which the entire environment comes into play. Owners may need to rethink their rental models to allow for different types of retail experiences, such as short-term pop-ups or exhibitions. There is a great opportunity here to be innovative.

The COVID-19 pandemic has served to accelerate changes that were already underway and accelerate innovation among mall owners and retailers alike. Canadian consumers were already starting to change how they shopped, and now they are looking for a significantly better experience that connects the online world to an elevated in-person experience for the long term. The unknowns coming out of the pandemic have added even more variables into this evolution that need to be navigated, such as how long social distancing measures will be maintained as well as the accelerated shift in consumer behaviours.

“One thing is certain: a revolution is coming to our retail experience,” added Weintraub. “It’s clear that the pandemic has changed how people feel about interacting with the world around them. These changes could last long into the future, which meansretailers and landlords alike have both a great opportunity and obligation to reimagine the entire customer journey and createa totally new kind of destination that will keep visitors coming back for years to come.""",[]

Microsoft will not reopen its huge store in Metropolis at Metrotown and Aldo has filed for creditor protection.

The impacts of COVID-19 have been the final nail for some struggling retailers, and restaurants as well. Nando’s in Burnaby has shut down one of its locations.

Aritzia Inc., which operates out of Metropolis at Metrotown, reported a whopping first-quarter loss and revenue drop after temporarily closing all its stores due to COVID-19 health precautions, but the clothing retailer sees an opportunity to expand its business amid the global pandemic.""It wasn't easy seeing all our boutiques closed ... and the corresponding decline in our revenues and our profitability,"" said CEO Brian Hill.

The Vancouver-based retailer closed its 96 stores on March 16 and saw a significant decline in sales in the first two weeks of that month. Despite the drop in overall revenues, e-commerce sales grew more than 150 per cent during the quarter.

Aritzia started a phased reopening of stores on May 7. Thirty had reopened by the end of the quarter and 89 as of July 9, including in Burnaby.

Reopened stores have exceeded the company's expectations so far, said Hill, noting the company is viewing the second quarter ""with cautious optimism as we prepare for a period of recovery.""

During the first five weeks of the quarter, reopened stores have performed at 55 per cent to 65 per cent of last year's revenue levels, he said, calling that ""well above our initial expectations.""

""We don't know what the new normal will hold until sometime next year.""

Aritzia's net revenue for the first five weeks of the second quarter were down 25 per cent to 30 per cent compared with the same time last year, said chief financial officer Todd Ingledew.

E-commerce revenue remains strong, though growth has moderated since most of the company's stores have reopened, he said, and is currently trending 50 per cent to 100 per cent higher than last year.

Aritzia plans to open five or six new stores and reposition three existing locations, primarily in the second half of the fiscal year. Half of the leases the company has signed were negotiated after the pandemic began and reflect what he called ""compelling post-COVID financial terms.""

The real estate opportunity for Aritzia right now is ""unprecedented,"" said Hill, noting that the company is understored and many other retailers are shutting their bricks-and-mortar locations.

""More premier locations are becoming available and under increasingly compelling financial terms,"" he said.

""So much so, it's hard to determine at this point if our stores were more profitable prior to COVID-19 ... or our new stores will be more profitable as a result of new economics post COVID-19.""

The Toronto-based private equity firm that owns Gateway had agreed in December to sell the 27-property gaming operation to New York City’s Leisure Acquisition Corp. for $1.5 billion.

article continues below

The transaction was set to close on April 5, but that closing date was pushed back to June 30.

Last week, Leisure Acquisition’s shareholders voted to again extend the deadline for closing the deal to buy Gateway – this time until December 1.

Gateway’s holdings in Metro Vancouver include the Grand Villa Casino in Burnaby, the Starlight Casino in New Westminster and the Cascades Casino Resort in Langley.

“The company believes that it is unlikely that there will be sufficient time before June 30, 2020 to complete an initial business combination,” Leisure Acquisition said in a June 23 corporate filing.

It then added some doubt about whether the transaction would ever close.

“Either the company or Gateway has the ability to terminate the merger agreement to the extent the business combination has not been completed by July 15, 2020,” Leisure Acquisition said in its filing. “There can be no assurance that it will be possible to complete a business combination with Gateway prior to July 15, 2020.”

With the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging many service-sector businesses’ balance sheets, plenty of mergers and acquisitions in those industries that were agreed to before March have either been scrapped or are uncertain to close.

Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands in February agreed to sell a 55% stake to Sycamore Partners for US$525 million, but then accepted Sycamore’s bid to scuttle the transaction.

Cineworld Group plc (LSE:CINE) similarly terminated its $2.8 billion takeover of Cineplex Inc. (TSX:CGX).

Rumours have swirled that Air Canada (TSX:AC) has been lobbying federal officials to block its plans to buy Air Transat for $700 million, although Canada’s national carrier has denied those reports.

Lawson Lundell partner Mandeep Dhaliwal stressed to Business in Vancouver that he is not aware of the situation between Catalyst and Leisure Acquisition. However, he said, that the global pandemic is likely giving many companies pause to consider transactions that have not yet completed.

“A lot of companies that had agreed to transactions, if they think that things have materially changed and would not be as beneficial, they would be scrutinizing the text of contracts to see if there is anything for material adverse change or force majeure [unforeseeable circumstances that could prevent a company from fulfilling a contract],” Dhaliwal told Business in Vancouver.

“Certainly there’s been a lot of conversations about this in the past few months.”

Dhaliwal, whose practice deals mainly with banks and private lenders in secured and unsecured financing transactions, said that while deal flow is down from 2019 corporate transactions are being completed.

“Now, I was a bit of a pessimist to begin with, thinking that things would fall off a cliff, so it’s all a matter of perspective, but transactions have been closing over the past few months,” he said.

Back in 2010, Dhaliwal’s firm represented Catalyst on some aspects of its acquisition of Gateway.

Gateway had morphed from being an income fund in 2007 to being owned by two shareholders: Crown and Macquarie Bank.

Those entities borrowed more than $1 billion from various banks, and in 2010 had started to run into trouble.

A consortium of debt holders, led by Catalyst, started buying Gateway’s debts from various banks and consolidated that debt.

Catalyst executives then offered an ultimatum to Gateway principals on behalf of all the debt holders. Catalyst wanted Gateway to either pay off its debts or ante-up the lion’s share of the company’s equity.

That set the wheels in motion for the debt-holders to pay off $1 billion of Gateway’s $1 billion-plus in debt and provide a capital infusion of $100 million, and a $500 million term loan.

In exchange, they got 98% of the company and were free to start racking up some new debt of their own.

Dhaliwal told BIV in 2011 that he found it fascinating to watch how private equity investment firms went out to purchase public debt with an eye to becoming management, and acquiring equity, only to then go out and raise new debt for the enterprise.

Once in control of Gateway, the Catalyst consortium hired Jefferies and Co. to raise hundreds of millions of dollars of debt in the bond market.

Catalyst also briefly intended to take Gateway public in 2012 but did not complete the IPO.

Gateway bills itself as one of the largest and most diversified gaming and entertainment companies in Canada, with 25 gaming properties in B.C. and Ontario as well as two additional properties in Edmonton Alberta.

It employs 8,200 people and features 423 table games, 14,076 slot machines, 82 food and beverage outlets and 561 hotel rooms.",[]

The Greater Vancouver Food Bank Society provides food support to more than 8,000 children, seniors, and people with disabilities in Burnaby, New Westminster, Vancouver and the North Shore through 13 community food hubs. In order to unload up to 15,000 pounds of food and to set up its ""pop-up grocery stores"" at neighbourhood houses, churches and community centres, the food bank relies on the generosity of up to 20 volunteers for a four-hour service for each site three weeks every month.

""Our weekly food hubs are not only a place for people to access food but they are places to build community and connect with resources like nurses, dieticians and tax help,"" David Long, Greater Vancouver Food Bank CEO, said in a news release. ""We've hit a critical gap in weekly volunteers for our food hubs and are appealing to the public for support to ensure we are able to deliver this important service to the communities we serve.""

According to the society, hub volunteers create a warm, dignified and welcoming environment where clients can select fresh and non-perishable items for themselves and their families and can connect with resources in their community.

“Making new friends and seeing old ones every week provides a stable, consistent place many rely on for breaking the cycle of social isolation,” said the society’s press release. “We are extremely grateful for these volunteers, but need more to continue offering this critical service.”

The Southside Community Church program (7135 Walker Ave.) operates in Burnaby. Other community food hubs in critical need of volunteers are the New West Community Food Hub (613 Queens Ave.) and the St. Margaret's Cedar Cottage Church location in Vancouver (1530 East 22nd Ave.)

“Each food hub is unique and caters to the diverse needs of their community with invaluable input from site hosts,” said the press release. “If you speak a second language, enjoy working with people or simply want to be a part of a team that cares about their community, this is the role for you.”

The Greater Vancouver Food Bank has a vision of providing accessible, healthy and sustainable food and proactively working to alleviate hunger in the communities it serves.

""Volunteering at the food bank has certainly become one of the highlights of my week,"" said Alex, a volunteer at the Kiwassa Neighbourhood House Community Food Hub.

If you or anyone you know has a few hours to spare each week, or every other week, contact the food bank’s volunteer coordinator at volunteer@foodbank.bc.ca or 604-880-7073.

Gloria Cooper and Aruna N.B. Khan teamed up to host the Everyday Superheroes drive-by food bank event at Cariboo Hill Secondary School on May 30.

“The event went better than we could ever have imagined,” Khan wrote in an email to the NOW.

Cooper, a mortgage specialist, and Khan, a Realtor, have frequently teamed up in the past to host community events.

“Due to lockdown and social distancing, we were forced to think outside the box as to how we could bring community together to help combat some of the effects of COVID-19 in our communities,” their email said. “So, we came up with this big and crazy idea that involved cars driving by like a drive-through restaurant, people popping trunks, food being collected, superheroes, capes, cowbells and prizes. We had no idea if it would work or not.”

The two stayed up several nights into the wee hours creating superhero capes, sourcing prizes, creating logos and making volunteer badges – all on a quest to share their message that, no matter who you are, you can be a superhero and make a positive impact on your community.

The two noted they were determined to help families who are struggling to access food during this pandemic and to bring community together in the process.

It worked.

“Donors drove from as far as Surrey and North Vancouver to come to our drive-by to make a donation,” they said.

Crest Plaza’s Pharmasave employees pitched in bagged goodies (dropped off by local canine actor Action Jackson Brown and his owner), and local resident Victor Villamera came by with crates of fresh bread, bagels and buns – enough to feed hundreds of people – all bought and donated on his own birthday.

Volunteers – including Mayor Mike Hurley, MP Peter Julian and MLA Katrina Chen – donned red capes to help out, and Burnaby firefighters arrived in one of their large trucks, with sirens on, and stayed to cheer on donors.

“With the help, kindness, enthusiasm and generosity of our amazing superheroes – our leaders, volunteers (adults and youth), community members, local businesses and the Burnaby firefighters, we were able to collect superhero volumes of food to distribute to four food banks throughout Burnaby and New Westminster,” their email says.

That realization has led to the creation of an Everyday Superheroes drive-by food donation event, set for Saturday, May 30 at the Cariboo Hill Secondary School parking lot.

Realtor Aruna Khan and mortgage specialist Gloria Cooper are organizing the food drive.

“Presently, from reading posts, communicating with people and watching the news, it is evident that so many of us at home are feeling useless and are craving to help in some sort of way,” Khan wrote in an email to the NOW. “But, understandably, ‘helping’ is quite the challenge during COVID-19 as we cannot gather.”

After speaking with various food banks and community leaders, the two women found out that food bank donations have dropped dramatically since quarantine began – but the need for the food has not.

So the two are inviting everyone to a contactless food drive, running from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the parking lot at Cariboo Hill Secondary School (8580 16th Ave., Burnaby).

How it works is simple: Just pack a bag or box in your trunk with your non-perishable food donations. Enter the school parking lot via 16th Avenue, and volunteers will guide you through the driveway to the drop-off spot. Once there, pop open your trunk from the safety of your driver’s seat. A volunteer, wearing gloves and mask, will take the donations from the trunk and leave a thank-you note for you.

“With the constant stream of sad/bad news and feelings of hopelessness, we believe that an event like this would not only life the spirits of the community but give everyone an opportunity to help support each other and make a difference in a very safe, easy and fun way during these challenging times,” Khan wrote.

Khan said organizers are grateful for the support of community leaders, including mayors Mike Hurley of Burnaby and Jonathan Cote of New Westminster, New Westminster-Burnaby MP Peter Julian and Burnaby-Lougheed MLA Katrina Chen, whom she noted have all expressed a hope to turn out and volunteer.

The society is joining its counterparts across Canada to bring the IG Wealth Management Walk for Alzheimer’s into the virtual realm on Sunday, May 31 – and Burnaby residents are invited to take part.

An online livestream will run from 9 to 10:30 a.m. (Pacific time), and it can be accessed from anywhere with an Internet connection. The livestream will introduce people across Canada who are affected by dementia, and it will pay a call on walkers and Alzheimer’s societies across the country.

A press release about the event notes that more than 70,000 British Columbians live with dementia, and that number is expected to grow.

“Dementia doesn’t stop, and neither do we,” said Alzheimer Society of B.C. CEO Maria Howard. “Even though the ways we are delivering our programs and services have needed to change, we are still committed to helping British Columbians affected by dementia. I invite all of you to help us do this by registering and fundraising for the IG Wealth Management Walk for Alzheimer’s online.”

Everyone who wants to take part is invited to get moving – in whatever way works for them – and share a photo or video online, using the hashtag #IGWalkForAlz. You can do jumping jacks, lift weights, do a dance, stroll around the block, take the stairs, do yoga, or whatever else appeals to you.

You can do your personal fitness challenge before, during or after the event and create a fundraising page to share with friends and family.

“We know that due to physical distancing, many people are feeling isolated,” Howard said. “We hope that by joining us at the online event, Canadians affected by dementia can connect with each other and honour and remember people in their lives affected by the disease. Now, more than ever, connection is important.”

""With so few vacancies in the Lower Mainland, it’s even harder because landlords have so many applicants they usually don’t choose to rent to people who have struggled with homelessness.""

Through a program called A Key of Her Own, EFry helps women who have been homeless for more than six months or who are repeat shelter users, to access housing. Part of a federal government initiative called Housing First, the program also supports women in becoming successful long term tenants and connecting to local community supports.

article continues below

The program is making a significant difference in the lives of women struggling with homelessness.

“I would have been lost without this support,” one woman writes on her program evaluation form. “I now feel stable both in my housing and emotionally. It has improved my life dramatically. I now have hope that I can obtain my goals.”

A significant portion of A Key of Her Own clients are seniors or mothers with young children. The first step in supporting vulnerable women is getting to know them.

""During our intake process, we ask questions to prompt each woman to tell her story,"" says Susan. ""When women have been traumatized, they have a hard time with trust so they might not openly say, “I have health issues” but based on their answers, we can usually figure out what struggles they’re facing.”

""A Key of Her Own is more than just finding a woman a place to live,” says Susan. “We provide ongoing support for up to two years that greatly improves a women’s ability to deal with common barriers such as hoarding, mental health issues, physical issues or addiction.

""For example, we have clients who, without help, wouldn't remember to pay their rent on time and find themselves being evicted as a result. We meet with women on an ongoing basis, once a week, twice a week, whenever they need support in their community or in their home. By doing this we can help deal with the issues as they come up rather than after they have become a crisis.”

Most women connect with A Key of Her Own through referrals from community agencies, EFry drop-in centres or EFry’s shelters.

“It is very rewarding speaking to women who now have a home of their own and a life they are proud of,” says Susan.

But in the case of the Reading Room in Burnaby, it took a village to raise a building.

Once church members of the Willoughby Heights Canadian Reformed Church living in Burnaby saw the need for a reading room in which to discuss the Christian faith in the area, the plan was set into action.

article continues below

Soon after, the Willoughby Heights, Aldergrove, and Chilliwack Canadian Reformed Churches, as well as the United Reformed Church in New Westminster, came together to build a place in Burnaby for people to learn about the Christian faith.

Together, the four churches operate the Reading Room in Burnaby.

“We have members across Metro Vancouver, in Surrey, Langley,” says one volunteer, a church member of Willoughby Heights Canadian Reformed Church. “But there was a need for a space in Burnaby.”

Approaching its first-year anniversary, the Burnaby Reading Room provides a non-confrontational space for Christians and non-Christians to explore the religion, ask questions, and have lengthy discussions. The room offers comfortable seating, books and other literature, and has volunteers on hand to answer questions.

Those looking for deeper explorations are welcome to participate in the weekly, drop-in Bible study sessions on Wednesday evenings at 8 p.m.

“We discuss a range of topics in the Bible and apply them to modern day living,” says a volunteer. “It’s a comfortable, open environment where people can ask questions about life.”

The Canadian Reformed Church was born out of the Reformation in the beginning of the sixteenth century, when some felt the Church of Rome had strayed too far from its scriptural roots.

Today, the church believes the Holy Bible is the Word of God, and that God’s Word represents the final rule of faith and life. It has adopted three creeds from the early church—the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed—and three confessions from the Reformation—the Belgic Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism, and the Canons of Dort.

Worship times for each of the four churches operating the Burnaby Reading Room can be found on their websites: www.whcanrc.com, www.aldergrovechurch.com, www.canadianreformedchurchchilliwack.org, and www.newwesturc.org.

When the pandemic hit, it was about if they should stay open and try and survive on takeout service. Some restaurants were better equipped than others to set up for takeout and deliveries. Pizza joints, for example.

article continues below

Then it was how to reopen on June 1, and if that should include sit-down service.

The Burnaby restaurant with the biggest portions has bucked the trend to reopen sit-down service by sticking with takeout.

That restaurant would be Anton’s Pasta, which advertises its “enormous portions” right on its homepage.

This Burnaby Heights institution on Hastings Street prides itself on serving up tasty portions of pasta that you will likely not finish in one sitting. So Anton’s is used to packaging up food and sending it home with diners.

Good for them.

Burnaby restaurants are finding out what works for them and going for it. I was at Anton’s the other night and business seemed brisk. It could returned at some point to sit-down service and if it does, I’ll let you know.

I wrote about Anton’s last October and it was the most-read food blog I’ve had in more than two years.

This is part of what I wrote about its enduring charm: “One reason? The huge menu. There are a lot of difference choices of pasta dishes on Anton’s menu. Another reason? Huge portions. It’s a calling card. People proudly waddle out of Anton’s with a container of food that will feed the family for dinner the next night, or you for a few more lunches. Life is expensive in Burnaby so it’s nice to get two meals for the price of one. And eating homemade pasta feels comforting.”

Life is still just as expensive and even more people are out of work right now due to the pandemic.

So if you’re struggling but still want to treat yourself, check out Anton’s and get fed for a few days. Sometimes food equals happiness.

Re: 'Screeching' SkyTrain in Burnaby:

article continues below

﻿The increased and excessive noise of SkyTrain is occurring in locations other than New Westminster and may represent a larger and more costly problem than TransLink is conceding.

Residents living near the track west of Edmonds station, where it parallels Rumble Street, have been complaining to SkyTrain since March of intolerable noise levels averaging 90 decibels westbound and now approaching the same eastbound.

While on the street over 60-metres away, conversations must stop until the trains pass. In homes, the same distance or further from the track windows must be closed to hear TV shows even with increased volume.

There are hundreds of residents affected in this section of the line. The adverse health impacts of continued exposure to excessive noise on humans and their pets are well-documented. Hearing damage begins at 85 db with prolonged exposure.

Our exposure at 40 metres is greater than a motorcycle or lawnmower at eight metres, where ear protection is recommended.

TransLink has responded to our letters with the same explanation regarding the broken track grinder and the same assurances maintenance will be done here in July.

However, grinding was done in 2019 to reduce noise levels almost as bad as current, and rails were replaced a number of years ago, yet residents who have lived here for over 20 years believe the current noise levels are well above any they have experienced.

While we are anxious for the maintenance ASAP, as the noise is intolerable with trains running at 90-second intervals to ensure capacity for social distancing, our experience suggests this grinding needs to be done semi-annually to maintain normal operating levels.

As the problem of pitting in the rails was reported in the late 1980s shortly after the Expo Line opened, it would seem TransLink needs to find a permanent solution to avoid costly annual grinding, and/or premature rail replacement, to ensure the health of residents in nearby communities is not compromised.

On May 10, police got a report that a large shipping container full of rice worth about $20,000 had been stolen from a South Burnaby business, according to a police press release.

Further investigation led police to a residence in Langley, and, on June 26, Burnaby RCMP’s prolific offender suppression team, strike force and frontline members descended on a Langley warehouse with a search warrant

They seized 3,200 pounds of rice, 26 pallets of sandals, 400 packages of paper towels, large quantities of toilet paper and diapers, one crate of ammunition and more than $1,500 in cash, according to the release.

Three people were detained and have since been released, according to Burnaby RCMP.

The investigation is ongoing, and charges will be forwarded to the B.C. Prosecution Service upon completion, police said.

“This warehouse contained a stockpile of stolen goods on a commercial scale and was located after diligent investigative efforts and coordination between a number of units at Burnaby RCMP,” Burnaby RCMP Insp. Matt Toews said in the press release.

You would be wrong.

article continues below

Living in a quiet, family-oriented Burnaby neighbourhood comes with it a sense of security. People feel safe walking the streets and letting their kids play. Neighbours watch out for each other.

For many, this is their forever neighbourhood precisely because of that feeling of security.

And so when a little crime wave hits, it hurts so much more than if you live in the crime central of Metrotown, which consistently has the worst stats for everything from B&Es to thefts from vehicles. Metrotown residents deserve better – they deserve to live in safety too - but it’s not exactly a surprise or a shock when thieves prey on this area.

For the folks who live in the leafy Montecito neighbourhood in North Burnaby, bordered approximately by Halifax, Duthie and Broadway, a rash of crimes this past week was really felt.

Someone I know contacted me about it and thought it might make a story. I agree.

Several of the townhouse complexes located just east of Montecito Elementary were hit by either one terrible person or several terrible people. It was mostly vehicles broken into and windows smashed.

The person or people responsible then rampaged over to the school and smashed up a bunch of windows that are now all boarded up.

The person who contacted me didn’t have much taken, other than some CDs (that made me laugh – what a score!) and two CO2 containers used to make drinking water bubbly. Strangely, the most valuable item in the vehicle, a child’s car seat, was left. Guess it was too much to carry.

Oh, and a camera in the vehicle was smashed, for some reason.

“It felt like one of those quick-buck, grab-anything things,” this person said.

Others weren’t as lucky.

So you’re probably reading this and wondering, “Well, so what?”

Well, since you asked, add it all up.

A bunch of ICBC claims. More money the Burnaby School District has to spend to repair windows that could go towards, I don’t know, buying more books.

The much-bigger thing that was stolen was the trust and security of the people who were victimized. And even those who didn’t have their homes or vehicles targeted will hear about it and they will feel less safe than they did before. I’m sure it’s also gone through people’s minds about what might have happened if one of the residents had accidentally stumbled upon the crimes while they were in progress.

Would the thief or thieves have assaulted a witness?

Then there’s also the feeling that someone who lives in the area might be responsible and could do it again.

Add it all up and it’s just a sad situation for everyone.

Brianne Amira called the Burnaby RCMP for an “emergency situation” in which she felt she required police attendance.

article continues below

“It wasn’t a matter of life and death - but serious enough that the assistance of RCMP was necessary,” Amira told the NOW. “In fact, it was recommended by an RCMP officer handing a separate, but related officer that I contact them for a new file, so I did exactly that.

“Upon reaching the non-emergency dispatch, I explained to her the history of the last file and that the office handling that particular file had requested me to call to get a new file created and for an officer to come to my residence. But rather than sending an officer to my home, the dispatcher spend a good five minutes berating me, telling me they don’t normally send officers for what I was calling in for, and that she would have to try to get a hold of the other officer to ensure that what I was telling her was true and that he did, indeed, request I call - making me feel as though she didn’t believe me. From there, I was put on hold for another 5 minutes until she finally came back on the line and advised me that she wasn’t able to get a hold of him, and begrudgingly started a new file and sent an officer to my home.”

Amira was shaken up after the call and decided to complain formally to the E-Comm 911 service that handles such calls.

“While this wasn’t a life-or-death situation, as mentioned, it easily could have been and, in my opinion, the actions of this call-taker significantly delayed police response.”

E-Comm 911 recently responded via email to Amira, saying it had reviewed the call in question and agreed that it was not handled properly.

“After reviewing the call, members of our quality assurance team have confirmed the call taker did not follow proper procedure and should have created a file right away,” said an email from E-Comm 911, a copy of which was provided to the NOW. “Moreover, the demeanor of our employee during the call did not reflect the level of professionalism that we expect from our call takers. This employee’s supervisor is now aware of our findings and will be following up with the call taker to review the matter and take appropriate actions.We take all caller concerns very seriously. I want to stress that this is not to our usual standard of care and we appreciate you reaching out and giving us the opportunity to look into and address this matter.”

Amira said she was hopeful that the call taker in question would receive further training to protect others in the future.

“My biggest concern isn’t for me, but for anyone else who might’ve had the misfortune of having this call taker and needing immediate assistance but not having their concerns taken seriously,” Amira said. “So my hope is that this call taker receives further training on how to properly handle calls in the future, and maybe learns to show a bit more compassion as well, as her demeanour with me was anything but that.”",[]

So complaining about something like the size of food portions while a restaurant is struggling seems like a terrible thing to do.

But people are doing it.

On Saturday, I wrote about Burnaby’s Anton’s Pasta staying open for takeout only and discussed the decisions restaurants have to make during this perilous time. I referenced the long history Anton’s has as the place with the “enormous portions” for its diners.

This blog was the most-read blog I’ve had in several months and generally the comments were positive about how good it is to see a Burnaby business making things work during a pandemic.

Sadly, several people decided to actually take the time to email me and whine about how they didn’t think Anton’s portions were as “enormous” as they used to be before the pandemic.

You. Have. Got. To. Be. Kidding. Me.

Whether it’s true or not, I don’t care. I saw people picking up their orders the other day and it looked like a full meal to me.

I've had a few other messages from some Burnaby residents complaining about other restaurants being too slow with service.

Imagine whining about a restaurant that is trying to hang on as they see a pandemic keep many of their customers at home. Imagine how clueless and insensitive you have to be to the plight of a restaurant owner to be this petty and entitled.

Restaurants are a tough business to be in during the BEST OF TIMES – let alone a pandemic - so maybe just pump the brakes on your complaining for a few minutes.

Support your local businesses. Tip well. And remember that many of them are hanging on for dear life.

The NOW reached out to former CIO Shari Wallace, but she said she was unable to comment due to the terms of her release.

According to her LinkedIn profile, Wallace was with the city from March 2013 until July 2020, a total of more than seven years.

Ishikawa didn’t specify which other positions were terminated, but an organization chart shown to the NOW by a city employee shows vacancies in several senior positions, including two directly reporting to the CIO and four second-level subordinate positions.

Ishikawa said the city expects to be recruiting a new CIO “shortly.”

This isn’t the only unexplained high-ranking departure from the city in recent months; the city’s fire chief, Joe Robertson, also left his position in March in a shroud of mystery after nearly a year on leave. He had served the city for 30 years.

A server at a Burnaby restaurant asked me for my name and phone number. This was done in case of a COVID-19 diagnosis and so Fraser Health could track and get in contact with diners.

article continues below

I was surprised because it’s the first time since I started dining out again on June 1 that a restaurant had asked me (a couple already had my details when I made a reservation).

All the others had not specifically asked, despite what health officials said they want when restaurants were allowed to reopen.

The province has urged restaurants to ""retain contact information for one member of every party of patrons for 30 days in the event that there is a need for contact tracing on the part of the medical health officer.""

In my experience, this is not happening. But it should. I know it’s a pain and some customers might freak out about it (they shouldn’t) but it’s an important part of dealing with COVID-19, especially during this reopening.

WorkSafeBC’s guidelines for the reopening cover sectors ranging from restaurants to offices, including guidance on how many people should be allowed in a business as well as controlling entry and exit points.

Al Johnson, the agency’s head of prevention services, said the guidelines were a “collaborative exercise” that included employers, retail and safety associations, restaurants, agriculture groups and government ministries.

In every industry, the guidelines emphasize having as little contact with customers as possible and ensuring social distance is maintained.

WorkSafeBC advises businesses to follow the protocol on gatherings, limiting events, such as museum tours, and working to establish safe occupancy limits.

It said specific guidelines for sports and recreation as well as child care will be released later.

But before reopening, the safety agency said businesses need to ensure they have a COVID-19 safety plan to protect workers and it must be displayed.

Johnson said every employer and business is different but the main safety issues revolve around the general principles of maintaining distance, and not just between workers but with members of the public as well. The principles also include good sanitation and hygiene, cleaning, and rethinking business practices.

“Undoubtedly, the devil is in the details when it comes to developing a plan, a safety plan ... so there will be questions, there will be people who need more information and we’re prepared,” Johnson said in an interview.

Employers should seek input from workers to ensure their concerns are addressed, he added.

About 300 prevention officers will oversee enforcement of the guidelines through unannounced inspections and taking complaints, he said.

“We want employers to succeed here so we are wanting to do everything with them and make sure employers have everything in place,” Johnson said.

If employers don’t have a health and safety plan or don’t intend to create one then WorkSafeBC will take action, he said.

“We will write orders and take them to sanction should we need to like any other health and safety violation in the workplace,” he said.

Penalties could include a ticket, an order, monetary sanction or even shutting down a business until a violation is corrected.

“We’re hoping it doesn’t come to that,” he said.

Johnson said employees have a right to refuse to go to work if they feel unsafe and should follow information on the WorkSafeBC website to file a complaint.

The agency says it will continue developing industry-specific guidelines as more businesses across B.C. begin reopening over the coming months.

Inside is still not great, as I see too many people in malls and stores not following Dr. Bonnie Henry’s guidelines. But outside? People seem to think that because they are outside that the rules simply don’t matter. As though fresh air kills the virus.

article continues below

Doug in Burnaby agrees.

The avid trail user – who didn’t want his last name used because he feared being attacked by trolls for speaking out – says people using Burnaby trails are not showing enough respect for others.

“I hoped that during a pandemic the incessant reminders of social distancing would sink in and everyone enjoying the outdoors would be kind and respectful to each other,” Doug said. “Apparently not for about a third of people. On a Sunday walk around Burnaby Lake, I encountered about a third who were so engaged in conversation or just oblivious to the common courtesy of falling into single file as my wife and I did whilst passing oncoming or overtaking others in order to maintain social distancing. A group of about 10 runners pounded past side by side owning the path.

“On their second trip around, it was me who stood my ground and it was me who got the dirty looks because I wasn’t making room for them who were running side by side. We are in a pandemic and we are so fortunate to be living in B.C. that has extremely low infection and hospitalization rates. Can people just be kind and considerate to take two steps to their right or left so we may keep it that way? A couple of kind steps is all I’m asking for.”

I’ve seen the same thing and that has kept me away from certain local trails. They aren’t wide enough to handle people walking side by side, and so many walkers and runners refuse to walk single file.

Just because you are outdoors doesn’t mean you can’t pass on COVID-19. Stay away from others.

Sure, it’s a bit of a hassle, but this is what we need to do.

The question was one faced by parents around British Columbia as their children’s schools sent out surveys asking one deceptively simple question: Do you intend to have your child return to in-class instruction starting June 1?

article continues below

It’s amazing how complicated one simple question can be.

For the record, I said No. My daughter isn’t returning for in-class instruction in New West on Monday. But I can’t remember the last time a simple question caused me so much what-iffing, but-waiting and on-the-other-handing.

My initial response to the news that schools were reopening their doors in June was one huge and enthusiastic “yahoo!” Our seven-year-old is an only child. She’s been learning at home since March break, while my husband and I have both been working remotely at jobs that have demanded more-than-full-time attention.

Finding a way to spend time with her has been, without a doubt, the single biggest challenge we’ve faced since we all came home for March break and never went back to our outside lives. Trying to engage and interact with her, to help her figure out the necessary technology, to make sure she’s on top of her assignments and gets her half-hour of reading done and writes her daily journal and checks out her virtual music lesson and doesn’t try to sneak extra YouTube videos in while she’s supposed to be doing Mathletics and then trying to think of ways we can all get fresh air and exercise and do something fun because you’re supposed to do something fun every day and why can’t I just bake cookies and if I was a good mom I would be baking cookies right now and helping her learn how to do more household chores and after all this pandemic isn’t supposed to be all bad I mean other people are having fun right now so why am I not having fun and why am I not sleeping and somebody hand me the Advil because I have a migraine and dammit I’m not supposed to take Advil now because wasn’t there something about Advil and COVID-19 so fine make it Tylenol and where is my coffee and

and

and

My right eye is twitching again just typing it all out.

Suffice it to say, sending our daughter back to school seemed like a good idea.

The thought that somebody else – somebody trained and qualified and good at teaching; somebody she’ll listen to and learn properly from instead of digging in her heels and resisting help – would take over her education? Yes, please.

And friends? In the solitary life of only children everywhere, Facetime and Messenger Kids have been her lifeline to other humans under the age of 10. And even though she’s an introvert at heart who enjoys her own space and keeps herself company pretty well, it’s not the same as spending time with other kids.

Returning to class, even part-time, could only be a win all around – for my husband, for me and for my daughter.

But wait.

We’re still in the midst of a viral pandemic. And, although all indications at this point are that the virus doesn’t transmit readily among groups of children, there are still a lot of question marks. What do we really know about how the virus will react until we try it out and see? And do I want my child to be part of one of those test groups? What if it all gets worse, fast, once groups of kids start assembling again? Do I want our family to come in contact with so many other people who may or may not have been taking social distancing as seriously as we have?

But wait.

I know the school district is taking its direction from people who know far more than I do. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control and public health officials and the Ministry of Education wouldn’t be clearing the return to school if they hadn’t decided, based on science and evidence, that it was possible to minimize and contain the risks.

But wait.

Even if our daughter does go back to school, will her friends be there? And will she really enjoy it, given how different the school day is going to look? If the kids aren’t allowed to work together and interact normally and play on the playground like they usually would, is she going to get the kind of social interaction that is at least half the reason we want to send her back? On the other hand, isn’t some social interaction, even limited and restricted interaction, better than none at all?

But wait.

If she doesn’t go back to school, can I keep doing this? Can I really make it through another month of muddling through home learning while I’m trying to navigate a full-time job? Can I handle being the “bad guy” every day (or, more accurately, taking turns with my husband being the bad guy) and forcing her to do the schoolwork she’d rather skip and dealing with the subsequent moods and attitude? Do I even want to try?

But wait.

Anxiety. She’s an anxiety-prone kind of kid, and we’ve finally managed to work through a lot of the anxiety she had – and, let’s face it, that we had - about the world turning upside down around us. We’ve found a bit of a “normal” in the way we live now, and we’re making it work (ish), so do I want to turn that all on its head, again, for the sake of a few weeks of school? If she takes a couple of weeks to get used to a new routine – and she always does – then is it even worth it for the little time that’s left in the school year?

But wait.

Is it fair to our daughter’s teacher to keep her home, when the teacher is going to be in class and ready to teach? Is it fair to my daughter to keep her home if her friends are going to be at school? Is it fair to me and my husband to keep her home when our jobs are still as demanding as ever? Is it fair that I even feel like all of this isn’t fair, given that we’re both employed and we have a home and we lack for nothing and we rate pretty damn high on the scale of pandemic privilege?

So yeah.

That “do you intend to send your child back to school” question was a simple one. It just didn’t come with a built-in guaranteed right answer.

In the end, our daughter’s own verdict that she’d rather continue learning at home tipped the balance for us. But even as I filled out “No” on the survey and sent it back to the school principal, I wondered if we were doing the right thing.

I still wonder.

It helps to know that our daughter is, after all, in Grade 2. Realizing that whatever decision we make, her entire academic future is not at stake here – well, that helps. And so does the fact that she has a dedicated and supportive teacher who has been 100% available to her students and their families since this crazy journey began. She’s assured us that our child will be fine, either way, and that she’s here to support the decision that works best for us.

So I feel good about our “No.” Mostly.

But let me be clear: I’m not casting judgment on anyone who said Yes and whose children will be back in school on Monday. I can think of a thousand reasons why parents want – and, in some cases, need – to have their children back in class. My decision isn’t intended to in any way cast aspersions on those reasons. I only hope that, by having families like ours step out of the in-class instruction part of learning, perhaps we can free up some of the teachers’ time and attention for those students who need that face-to-face contact more than we do.

We may still change our minds.

If COVID-19 has taught us nothing else, it has at least taught us that we can’t predict what life’s going to throw at us next. Everything may stay very much the same for the next month. Or everything could be upside down tomorrow.

All we can do is make the best decision for us right now, with the information we have available. And if something changes? Well, we’ll move on and do the next right thing – whatever that may be.

For all my fellow parents who’ve agonized over all of this too, solidarity. And for the teachers and administrators who have been working so phenomenally hard to make remote learning work and then to gear up for the return to class, all without missing a beat for our kids, my deepest gratitude.

As for my daughter? Well, she just got off a long Messenger Kids chat with her aunt in Toronto and is now, I suspect, sneaking YouTube videos instead of doing Mathletics.

But you know what? She’s done all her work for the week, and she’s not in any danger of losing her Grade 2 year if I give us both a break and let it go.

So I think I’ll pretend not to notice and have an iced coffee while I sit on the patio and proofread this post.

Here’s to the weekend – and here’s to Monday, whatever it may bring.",[]

Me too.

I’m sitting here writing this post as an act of solidarity with all of the parents who are also muddling through the brave new world of working full-time from home while attempting something resembling “home schooling” with your children.

Let me preface this up front by saying this: I know what a fortunate position I am in. Right here, right now, this house has two partners who are both working full-time. We are caring for one child, we have a freezer and a pantry full of food, and we have enough tucked away for a rainy day that even if it all came crashing down tomorrow we’d be fine for the time being.

These are blessings that I don’t take for granted.

But, while my gratitude for full-time work (work that I love and happen to get a paycheque for) remains boundless, it also means that neither my husband nor I have the time to be as engaged and involved with our daughter as we’d like. All those marvellous lists of resources and educational ideas for parents that are going around social media? They’re awesome, but the chances of me having time to delve into them, let alone sit down and actually interact with my child to make most of them happen, are slim to none.

I do not need any posts about “how to make baking muffins an educational activity for your child” or “how you and your child can build a backyard rocketship.” What I need are basic strategies for survival. Period.

So I’m writing my own.

Thanks to some crowd-sourced wisdom from the New West Moms Group on Facebook, I have come up with this list of strategies to help you stay sane while you pretend this is a balancing act you can actually accomplish.

Take what will help you, discard what won’t, or just swear at me from the comfort of your own home if it’ll make you feel better.

Here, for what it’s worth, are my 10 survival strategies:

1. MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS A WORK SPACE.

Whether you have an actual “home office” or you’re working on a laptop in the living room, try to make sure everyone in the house has a defined work space – and that includes your child. Everyone needs a space where they can go to be (mostly) uninterrupted and where they can work without being distracted by others.

Be sure your children know that when you’re at your work space, you’re working and therefore not meant to be interrupted except for important questions. Offer them the same courtesy in return with their schoolwork space.

Consider making your own “Do Not Disturb” sign to hang next to you when you really need a designated amount of quiet time (for an important meeting, for instance).

No, you’ll never stop the “Moo-ooooom” questions. But the more you can provide visual cues that you are “at work” or “at school,” the more you can help your whole family separate those tasks from the “at home” hours – and the more fun it’ll be to hang out together when you’re all “at home” again in the evening.

Or, at least, you can tell yourself that. It hasn’t entirely worked for me yet, but I remain convinced that it’s a strategy that will pay off – eventually.

2. ACCEPT REALITY.

Reality #1: You’re not at your office, so your dream of uninterrupted time to focus on work is officially on hold. Indefinitely.

Reality #2: You’re not “home schooling.” You’re pinch hitting in a crisis, to the best of your ability (whatever that means for you), but unless you’re actually a teacher in real life, you’re not a teacher – and you didn’t just suddenly become one because your kid is sitting there staring expectantly at you expecting you to make this all make sense for her.

So work isn’t going to be “normal,” and neither is school. The faster you can accept both of those facts, the better off you’ll be.





3. COMMUNICATE.

Communicate with your own work team – your co-workers, your boss – and being clear about what you can and cannot achieve and when you can and cannot be available. No one (well, no one with any common sense and compassion) expects that you’ll be the exact same employee you are at the office when your child is safely ensconced at school or daycare. Everyone knows you will have some distractions and that maybe the old nine-to-five expectations are off the table right now. Talk to your team, if you need to, about how you can all help each other make this transition to working at home easier.

Even more importantly, communicate with your child’s teacher. That teacher is still guiding your child’s education, and he or she is now also struggling to navigate some very unfamiliar territory. Stay in touch. If you’re struggling to help your child, reach out. Chances are other parents are struggling, too, and the more honest we all are with the teachers in our lives, the more those teachers will be able to help us help our children.

And, above all, communicate to yourself. Repeat to yourself, as many times a day as you need to: I am not alone. We are in this together.

4. BE FLEXIBLE WITH YOUR HOURS.

How much of your work must be done at a certain time, and how much do you just stick to your routines because that’s how you’ve always done it? Your answer will be individual to your own situation, but, wherever possible, now’s the time to rethink the way your schedule works.

If you have a partner in the house, sit down and rethink your schedules together. Can one be the “more available” parent in the morning and one in the afternoon? Can some work get done in the evenings or on the weekends? Can you take longer lunch hours to give yourself a chance to play in the backyard or go for a walk with your child in the middle of the day? However you can free yourself up to give your child some attention and engagement during the day, it’s worth giving it a try.

And if that way fails? Then try something different. These days life is all about different. Go with it, and see what kind of new “normal” you can create for your own family in a world where nothing is normal at all.



5. SET UP A SCHEDULE.

Whether you’re the kind of person who likes to map out your day down to the minute or the kind who likes to go with the flow, everyone – especially the small humans in the house – will benefit from some kind of routine.

Decide how your household’s “schedule” is going to work. Whether it’s a list of tasks that can be accomplished in any order (which is how we like it), or whether it’s a specific hourly plan, commit that plan to paper and post it in a place where you can all see it.

My daughter’s in Grade 2; I know that her academic future won’t be irredeemably altered if she fails to complete her journal writing or her two tasks in Mathletics today. But having those expectations written down on a task list helps her, because she can take her checklist and run with it while I do my own work (and, yes, answer the inevitable questions that arise while she’s working).

Another help for us? Build rewards into your schedule to keep everyone motivated. For my kidlet, it’s earning extra screen time by finishing academic, creative and household tasks. For me, it’s sitting down with a glass of Naramata rosé and a satisfying murder mystery novel to end my evening.



6. KEEP EVERYONE FED.

Snacks, snacks and more snacks. Make sure your day, and your child’s, includes food.

It seems like a foolish thing to say, but it’s amazing to me how often I can “forget” to eat when I get engrossed in something work-related. And if you have a child who, like mine, suffers from a bad case of the hangries when food doesn’t arrive on time, you want to be prepared.

However you choose to provide that food is up to you. Maybe your household works best with specific snack items set out in easy-to-reach bins for the kids so they can grab their own food when they need it. Maybe you’re more of a fridge free-for-all family or a formal-sit-down-meal household. Whatever your style, just keep everyone nourished and hydrated.

And then do it all again tomorrow. And the next day. And the next day. And the one after that.



7. GET OUTDOORS AND GET MOVING.

Your child needs fresh air, and so do you. And, here on the West Coast, we’ve been blessed by the arrival of spring in all its cherry-blossom-and-magnolia-tree glory. So get outside, every day. Twice a day if you can. Whether that means taking a longer lunch to get outdoors together, going for an early-morning jog or taking to your neighbourhood streets for an after-work stroll, make sure you get out and give yourselves that brain break.

And get moving. Crank the tunes and throw yourselves a dance party, search out some yoga on YouTube, or whatever it takes to work out your body and shake off some stress. Heck, just run laps around the yard or the living room if it helps.

Tire out all the bodies in your house, and hopefully all the minds will sleep better.

8. RELAX SCREEN TIME RIGIDITY.

I know, I know, you have screen time limits for a reason, and so do I. But we can all allow ourselves to relax those limits – at least a little - right about now.

If you absolutely need your child to stay out of your hair while you’re in a Zoom meeting, or you have two hard hours of work to complete on a tight deadline, then maybe a movie on the TV or a half-hour of precious games on the iPad will be the solution to buy you the time you require.

If your child is a bookworm who loves reading more than screen time, then embrace the magical unicorn that you are raising and let her go to town on books instead. But for the rest of us mortals? Screen time may be just the break we need.

9. LAUGH.

Seriously, just start laughing now, because it’s all crazy, and someday it’ll have to be funny because if it’s not funny you’ll just start crying and you might not stop.

So find the funny side, fast. And if you can’t find the funny side in your daughter’s attempt to dress the cats in Easter outfits or in your own attempts to produce home baking, then turn to the experts and put on your favourite funny TV show or podcast, or seek out some comedy on YouTube. Or something. Anything to get the giggles going.

Embrace this new life you are leading, in all its bizarre gloriousness, and laugh. And, yes, laughter tinged with overtired maniacal hysteria is still laughter.

10. ALLOW YOURSELF THE GRACE TO BE IMPERFECT.

You’re going to suck at this sometimes. Probably even a lot of the time. You’re going to be stressed, frazzled and emotional. You may lose your patience with your child, forget to return a phone call, or not remember what day it is. And you may do all of those things with or without a shower, with or without clean hair, and with or without pants.

You are not in fact an incurable mess. You are just a human being, navigating what is undoubtedly the strangest time in your personal history. It’s OK if that contact has to wait a few hours for an email, or if your child does not in fact finish her two tasks in Mathletics today.

Her future and yours do not depend upon perfection. They depend only upon you showing up and doing your best, whatever that looks like today.

That’s it. That’s all I’ve got. And if you see a frazzled-looking mom with her unwashed hair in a messy ponytail wearing the same leggings she’s been wearing for a week and dragging a whining blonde seven-year-old around the neighbourhood for a walk, that’s probably me.

Feel free to say hi. I’ll say hi back, and I promise I’ll even smile.

We may or may not actually have this whole situation in hand. But whatever happens, remember: we’re all in this together.",[]

But right now, it just pisses me off.

article continues below

When I see a troop of teens huddled together on the beach, sharing drinks and scooching closer to snap selfies, it doesn’t make me miss my high school days, it makes my stomach turn.

This isn’t a snow day, and it’s not the spring break social time that we’ve come to expect during this time of year.

We have yet to see the worst of this global pandemic, and while some seem to be brushing off the warnings by the authorities, I’m starting to take their ignorance personally.

COVID-19 is spreading quickly, and we’ve been urged to stay home and act as though we’ve already contracted the contagious disease.

Many cases are mild enough that the carrier doesn’t realize that they’ve been infected. One visit to a family member or friend, and the virus is passed on, and the spread continues.

In one of her latest updates, Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, urges residents to stay home, and only go out for essential trips such as to the grocery store. She emphasized that it’s alright to go for walks, but only with the members that live in your household.

Playdates are not ok. Coffee dates with friends are unacceptable. Crowding into public spaces - even if they are outdoors, is not practicing social distancing. Continuing to do these things will put our province in the same position as Italy, with rapidly spiking cases and increasing death rates by the hour. We could be where they are, only weeks from now, if we don’t start listening to the cautions today.

Physicians are working together to help spread the word, encouraging everyone to stay indoors. In an email sent to my aunt by her own physician, the content reads, “The time to act is now. Our province is in a state of emergency. What we do today will impact the health of British Columbians in the weeks to come. Stay home unless absolutely necessary. No dinner parties. No shopping. No sports, not even outside. Instead, have coffee with a friend online. Keep six feet or two metres away from everyone at all times. Call your loved ones and tell them to do the same.

Remind young people in your life that they can get sick from this virus. More importantly, they can be carriers and cause a lot of harm to parents, grandparents, and other loved ones.”

I get it, your kids are bored. Your teens are craving social interactions, and you need to separate stir crazy siblings. But it’s time to listen to the experts.

Our city shouldn’t have to tape up playgrounds, close down coffee shops, and barricade beaches to get you to stay home.

Because the only thing more annoying than staying home, is knowing that other people aren’t.

She didn’t seem concerned, more just curious about the introduction of a new word to her ever-growing vocabulary, and as she looked back down at her Lego structure that she was building, I realized that it was time to be honest with her.

article continues below

Because while I’ve spent the last couple of weeks hovered over my computer, watching live Q&A broadcasts with the World Health Organization (WHO), reading updates on the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) website, and following the latest travel advisories posted on Health Canada, my kids have been mostly in the dark about the quickly-spreading disease.

Last week we cancelled what was going to be our first-ever family trip abroad, a two-week trek through the south of France for spring break, and since then, our plans have been ever-changing. Maybe we’ll just go to Palm Springs or Phoenix instead? Nope, increased cases in the US. Maybe we’ll visit another province in Canada? Nope, air travel is not recommended. A ferry to Victoria? Social distancing doesn’t recommend time spent in such close quarters with so many people.

As I write this, the coronavirus has spread to 146 countries, with over 153,000 confirmed cases around the world - 73 of which are right here in BC. Things are changing by the hour, and while we’re all, for the most part, trying to remain calm, most of our kids are concerned, curious, or confused as they watch us as we watch things evolve.

It’s time to be open and honest with our kids about the coronavirus and all that’s happening around the world. They need to know why they can’t go to Science World, or hang out at the mall, and they need to know the severity of the situation.

Start by asking them questions to find out what they know - or think they know already. Then, let’s not just tell them to wash their hands, but explain why it’s more important than ever right now. Let’s explain to them that it’s not just about us getting sick, but about the people around us who are already sick or immunocompromised too. Let’s make sure they know that it’s not ok to make jokes about COVID-19 as the global death toll continues to rise.

Let’s tell our kids where to find the facts, and not to listen to the fiction that is filling their ears from friends and on social media platforms. Let’s explain the border closures and self-quarantines and stockpiling that’s happening, and let’s also show them videos of how people are coming together, supporting small businesses, providing for their sick neighbours who need help, and using this pandemic to come together as a community.

And then let’s comfort them, let them know that we’re here to answer their questions, and that we’ll do our best to keep them healthy and safe. And let’s follow through with that promise, because friends, this is only the beginning.

“It’ll be nice to not have to work so hard,” laughed Gill. “I’ll still continue to … I want to start my own business.”

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

What to look out for

The BBB says consumers should look out for the following red flags is they are searching for a lender or loan broker:

The health authority added the outbreak of C. difficile to its list of current outbreaks on July 14.

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Rash

If you are visiting someone who is located on an outbreak unit, visitors may be limited to two people at a time. Fraser Health asks that you do not visit other patient rooms or common areas on the unit such as the lounge and patient kitchenette. It also recommends you don’t visit public areas in the hospital such as the cafeteria and gift shop.",[]

Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

article continues below

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Mario Canseco is president of Research Co.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians. The data has been statistically weighted according to Canadian census figures for age, gender and region in British Columbia. The margin of error, which measures sample variability, is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.",[]

Luckily Sky Zone Trampoline Park in Surrey is just a few high bounces away.

The trampoline centre, which opened March 5, gives kids of all ages the chance to fly through the air, and to do so safely.

article continues below

“We have a very strict protocol,” says Morey Chaplick, owner of Sky Zone in Surrey.

Big kids are not allowed to jump with little kids, especially when it’s busy, he says. There are court monitors throughout the jump park, and there is always a manager on duty.

The Surrey trampoline park is the only Sky Zone in Western Canada. The company has been operating for 20 years and has 200 franchises worldwide.

Chaplick discovered Sky Zone when he lived in Toronto and took his son there, and was impressed by the safe, fun facility.

Now he’s opened his own park, filled with blue and orange trampolines as far as the eye can see.

But despite its size, the 30,000-square-foot facility has plenty of oversight from employees. The court monitors train for weeks at Sky Zone University, and managers are trained extensively in California, where the franchise is based.

With more than 10,000 people coming to Sky Zone since March, the worst injury they’ve had to handle was a rolled ankle, Chaplick says. His secret? Just follow the rules.

“Don’t try to do something beyond your capabilities,” Chaplick says. “Ask for help, and stay within limitations.”

Sky Zone in Surrey is at 11125-124th Street, a short drive from Burnaby.

The trampoline park is across the road from Scott Road SkyTrain station. The SkyTrain trip takes approximately 15 minutes from Metrotown to Scott Road station.

Unfortunately, that’s the case for many kids in B.C. “Twenty per cent of kids in B.C. live in poverty and most of those go to school hungry,” says Mahdi Sahebnasagh, founding owner of Kindermeals. “Teachers are struggling with them because they can’t focus,” he explains.

Sahebnasagh opened Kindermeals, a private lunch program based in Vancouver and servicing the Lower Mainland, in September 2017. The company provides healthful, nutritious and filling lunches, catered by The Caterer in Burnaby, to children in daycares and schools throughout the Lower Mainland.

article continues below

Parents can place orders for such dishes as chili with cornbread muffin or falafel with a side salad through the company’s website, and the hot meals will be delivered straight to the child’s daycare or school. Sahebnasagh currently has 50 children signed up for the program, though most are from more affluent families on Vancouver’s West Side, he admits. He hopes that one day the program will be used by parents and children from all income levels and walks of life.

In the meantime, Kindermeals has a program that encourages wealthier families to support children whose parents can’t afford to participate in the Kindermeals program. Each month, they can add a $5 to their monthly fee which will help feed a child from a low-income family.

The platform also allows parents from low-income families to indicate their household income on their profile, “and we can support them,” Sahebnasagh says.

Sahebnasagh is also hoping to alleviate the resources schools allocate to Hot Lunch programs. “What we’re looking to do is remove the hassle and logistical issues for schools,” Sahebnasagh says. While most hot lunch programs require three parent volunteers to support them, Kindermeals requires only one. This because most hot lunch programs offer five to six options every day, while Kindermeals offers only one, albeit a healthy and nutritious one.

Every students’ hands touched this quilt.” The kids have been working on the quilts since January, thanks to an ArtStarts grant that has enabled the school to bring in fibre artist Donna Polos for an artist in residence term. “It’s been a multi-medium process,” Polos said. “They drew, they used dye sticks, they used fabric paint to do watercolour technique and then embroidery and then quilting. They’ve done all the little quilting panels. I basted them together, and now they’re all having a traditional quilting bee.”",[]

His talent for creating delicious, market-driven dishes where global cuisines meet local ingredients is the reason why people are flocking to the new restaurant in Burnaby.

In fact, Chef Ken’s ever-growing interest in the world’s food fare is what drives the restaurant’s changing weekly feature menu. Whether it is Tuna Poke from sunny Hawaii, Jamaica Grilled Chicken or zesty Pad Thai with Panko Prawns from Southeast Asia, Foodies on Board’s customers feel like they are travelling around the world. Just as much as he loves global cuisines, Chef Ou also enjoys fusing different flavours together; his Tandoori Crispy Fried Chicken and Waffle is one of his most popular dishes.

Inspired by the seasons - and the fresh, local ingredients that they bring – Ou works closely with farmers and farm cooperatives to create dishes that have a refreshing interpretation of global cuisines. Think: spicy kimchi fried rice with in-house cured bacon and an unctuous, runny poached egg. The restaurant also serves handcrafted coffee drinks, vegan smoothies with organic coconut milk and flavored bubble teas.

With over two decades of extensive culinary experience in some of the world’s most renowned kitchens, chef Ou is able to bring a diverse blend of multicultural flavours to the table. Moving his way up through the ranks to sous and executive chef positions, Ken is as humble as he is talented. He has catered numerous events, from small groups to as large as five thousand people, and has worked as Chef for the Richmond Olympic Oval Museum opening ceremony and hotels such as Westin Grand, Hilton Metrotown and Delta Hotels by Marriott Vancouver Downtown Suites.

424,burnabynow,https://www.burnabynow.com/standout/why-contracts-are-so-important-1.2316642,Why contracts are so important,[],,"George Lee, founder and principal lawyer at George Lee Law Corporation, understands that his Asian clients find legal contracts to be something of a foreign concept.

“It’s not the way things get done in Asia,” he explains. “Many of my clients have lent millions of dollars to a friend, or a friend of a friend, on a handshake and trust. There is no legal contract and no security.”

article continues below

Relationship, George points out, is what counts in Asia. People deal with friends or people referred to them by friends. They see no need for a written contract.

“Naturally, when they come to Canada, they bring that habit with them,” George says. “They don’t understand the need for a written contract – until something goes wrong, of course.”

While encouraging his Asian clients to conform to the North American tradition of dealing in legally binding contracts, George also lends his expertise to explaining to Canadians the Asian reluctance to engage in written contracts.

“Most of the difficulties that arise for my Asian clients arise out of construction related issues,” he says. “Construction, renovation, buying and selling property – in Canada we take it for granted that a contract is involved. Not so with immigrants from Asia.”

The majority of civil litigation cases that George Lee Law Corporation deals with stem from real estate related transactions. In each case, George and his team sit down with clients to assess the situation and give legal advice—and usually a few options.

“I explain all the legal options and their consequences,” George states. “Most of the time we set a fee for each stage of the litigation. This gives our clients certainty, rather than a vague hourly rate.”

George is passionate about equal access to justice, and he feels that a flat fee allows clients to easily calculate whether litigation is in their best interests.

“If they win a judgment for $5,000 and then discover that the legal fees are actually higher than the total judgment they’ve been awarded they can’t help wondering ‘Where is the justice in that?’ We give them certainty and confidence in the Canadian legal system so they never have to ask that question.”

Fourteen years later, the Rotary Coats for Kids program now delivers more than 1,300 coats annually to elementary and high schools across Burnaby, and to various other organizations serving families in need.

“It’s wonderful to see it grow, but it’s also sad to see there’s still a need for it,” says Darlene a 19-year member of the Rotary Club of Burnaby Metrotown. “Unfortunately, B.C. leads the way in child poverty with as many as one in five children living in poverty in B.C. today. That number hasn’t changed in years. We need to be more proactive.”

The Coats for Kids program was created in response to the alarming child poverty statistic, delivering winter coats to children across Burnaby whose families couldn’t otherwise afford them.

“Some parents have to choose between putting food on the table and getting a winter coat for their child,” says Darlene. “Can you imagine having to make that choice? With the help of the program, it’s one less stressful thing they need to deal with in their daily life.”

The program was conceived by the Burnaby Neighbourhood House. As it expanded, The Rotary Club of Burnaby Metrotown took over the management of the program while the Burnaby Neighbourhood House continues to provide support and volunteers.

Today, the program is a true community affair with the community donating coats & seniors’ residences donating hand-knitted scarves and mittens to go with the coats. Local businesses contribute storage, delivery truck, donations & volunteers. The city of Burnaby even provides free parking for the coat delivery truck.

Every September, The Rotary Club of Burnaby Metrotown promotes Coats for Kids at the public library’s annual summer reading program wrap-up barbeque.

“It brings the whole community together,” says Darlene. “And it shows these kids that the community cares about them, that they’re not forgotten.”

Coat collections and donations begin in the spring. Drop offs are scheduled with schools and participating organizations in October and November.

“We do it discreetly, so the kids can come to the truck and choose their coats,” Darlene says. “We usually make sure we get double the amount of coats we need so they have a choice.”

All the coats that go unclaimed off the trucks find homes elsewhere, says Darlene, such as homeless shelters.

“I had a woman come onto the truck thinking she would never find a coat for her 10-year-old son,” Darlene recounts. “When she found one, there were tears in her eyes, and she gave me a hug.”

The program recently received the award for Best Project in Rotary District 5040.

“We learned about EFry’s summer camps a few years ago from our social worker,” says Linda. “The girls’ older siblings were going and it seemed like the perfect opportunity for them to have fun and bond. They absolutely love camp and can’t wait to go. They also love the Saturday Club day camps. They’re always up to something different: rock climbing, Science World, crafts.”

article continues below

Shawn Bayes, executive director of EFry and founder of JustKids says, “The JustKids programs are designed to support a unique group of children who have faced a lot of adversity. Children’s lives can be turned upside down when their parent goes to prison, especially when it’s their mother because incarcerated women are often single parents.”

Statistics show that without specialized supports, more than half of children who experience parental incarceration will one day end up behind bars. Fortunately, research also shows that risk can be dramatically decreased with specialized programs. EFry is currently the only organization in Canada to offer a suite of programs specifically aimed at supporting these children.

In the four years her foster children have been taking part, Linda has observed the positive impact. “Through JustKids, the girls not only get to stay in contact with their siblings, they’ve formed lasting friendships.”

Under its JustKids umbrella, EFry offers summer and spring break camps, Saturday Clubs, dental clinics, parent-child bonding programs, a Storybook Program where incarcerated parents are recorded reading books which are then delivered along with the recording to their child, as well as a holiday program that includes a Santa lunch and a toy bank.

“All our JustKids programs are offered at low or no cost, so poverty isn’t a barrier to participation,” says Shawn. “We are particularly grateful to our donors because all our work is made possible thanks to private sector support.”

Since launching JustKids, EFry has continued to expand the scope of its programs.

“Originally, our programs stopped at age 13 but the kids asked us to keep letting them come. So, we’ve evolved to continue being there for them as they grow,” says Shawn. “This year, some of our camp counsellors were former campers who participated in a training program we launched last year to prepare them for their first job. It’s turned out to be great role modelling for the younger children.”

With triumphs, medals, and places on the podium, dancers of all walks hailing from the Lower Mainland have strutted their stuff among world-class dancers. What do they all have in common? They came out of Burnaby’s prestigious dance studio, Dance Collective.

Eight-year-old Anthony Juo has been dancing for three years, though he was born with rhythm pumping through his body long before that. “I have loved interpreting rhythms of different songs since I was a baby,” he said. After learning dance by himself from YouTube videos, Anthony upgraded to lessons at Dance Collective. It was not long before he became a world-class dancer, taking home the bronze medal at the IDO WorldShow Dance Championships held in Germany. He owes his win to his teacher, choreographer, and mentor, Rebecca Collins.

“I am glad and very thankful that I have the best teacher who is strict and has helped shape me to be the dancer I am today,” Juo said. “Without her dedicated teaching, encouragement, support and love, I wouldn't have this bronze medal,” he explained, adding that he was competing with Russian and European dancers who were three years older than him.

Though Juo seems to be a dance prodigy with a bright future ahead, his win is not an isolated case. In fact, Collins shapes and conditions several dancers, along with Artistic Director/RAD Examiner, Kelly Douglas, who have gone on to represent the dance studio locally, regionally, and internationally. Take, for example, Tess Browning.

Browning, 15, has been dancing almost all of her life. With a ballet teacher, Kelly Douglas, for a mom, Browning said it was a natural fit for her to “give it a try.” Eleven years later, Tess won 2nd place for her classical ballet and 3rd place for her contemporary at the YAGP Regional Semi-Finals in Seattle. As Tess prepares for the final round of the Youth America Grand Prix in New York, the world’s largest international student ballet competition, she recognizes that she owes her early success to Dance Collective. “I have had many opportunities to perform in front of an audience, which really helped me feel more comfortable and confident on stage,” Tess explained. “I am so incredibly happy to have such wonderful opportunities to help me prepare for finals,” she added.

Tess and Anthony are just two out of a force of dancers all coming out of this Burnaby dance studio, who swept the podium at the 2018 Dance Power Burnaby competition this March.

Started in 1956 by a group of people in a church hall, the Memorial Society of B.C. now has in excess of 242,000 members around the province, making it the largest memorial society in North America.

""Because we have so many members,"" Nicole explains, ""I am able to negotiate lower costs with funeral service providers for our members. We only work with established funeral homes with a good reputation. Currently, we work with almost 30 funeral homes around B.C.""

The Memorial Society is a non-profit organization registered under the Societies Act of B.C. and is the only member-based, volunteer-driven memorial society in B.C.

""Everybody should be a member of the Society,"" Nicole says. ""Everybody alive will pass away at some point and for a $40 one-time membership fee, we can take the burden off your loved ones by referring them to a designated funeral service provider for the disposition of your remains and related issues.""

Upon joining the Society, members are asked to complete an arrangement form stating their wishes for their remains and detailing any pre-paid arrangements they may have.

Dr. Stuart Katz, a family and general dentist for over 20 years, offers cosmetic dental procedures, such as bleaching, crowns, and Invisalign® in his conveniently located, Burnaby Square practice.

""Cosmetic procedures are those that people want to have done,"" Dr. Katz explains, ""It's not something we're going to tell you that you need. For example, some people are perfectly happy with their teeth, even if the teeth are a little crooked or yellower than average. I usually mention that there are options to fix a little crowding in the front, or we could possible straighten teeth out if they wished. I want my patients to be aware that we can do that.""

As an aesthetic fix, cosmetic dentistry is totally self-driven.

""It's what separates it from other types of dentistry,"" says Dr. Katz. ""Cosmetic procedures require good consultation, and that's what we do. The patient needs to be aware of all the options, the process, and the cost.""

One cosmetic dentistry product that is gaining in popularity is Invisalign®, an almost invisible way to straighten teeth, and an alternative to wire braces.

""Some patients have trouble with the brackets on wire braces; they can be a bit uncomfortable,” says Dr. Katz. “The Invisalign treatment involves wearing clear plastic trays, custom designed for the patient's mouth. From an appearance perspective, it's almost invisible. No one needs to know that you're wearing braces.""

For younger patients under the age of 15, Dr. Katz still refers candidates for braces to the orthodontist.

""One thing with Invisalign® is that it comes with a set of instructions that need to be followed,” Dr. Katz points out, “including removing them after meals and cleaning teeth, and wearing them 20 – 22 hours a day. Not everyone is a good candidate. But many people find them more comfortable than traditional braces.""

Whether you're unhappy with the colour of your teeth or you have crooked or crowded teeth, there's likely a cosmetic procedure that can help.

At Sky Zone Trampoline Park in Surrey, people of all ages are welcome to join in the fun. In fact, owner Morey Chaplick says he saw a jumper who was over 60 having a great time there recently.

article continues below

“It’s a good workout,” Chaplick says, adding jumpers of all ages should stay within their limitations and ask for guidance from court monitors if they’re considering trying new tricks.

Jumpers should also be prepared to sweat, he says, and should wear clothing that wicks.

Sky Zone makes sure that all jumpers are given clear safety guidelines, and big kids aren’t allowed to jump near the little kids.

There is a separate trampoline court for toddlers throughout the day, and the jump park also holds Toddler Time sessions a few days a week. Toddler Time is half-price for the half-pint set, and the little ones get the place to themselves. There’s no charge for caregivers.

Court monitors are on site at all times, as is a manager, so parents can retreat to the parents’ lounge knowing their children are being watched and kept safe.

But toddlers aren’t the only ones who get to bounce around on their own. Starting in May, Sky Zone will host SkyJam for teenagers who are 16 or older.

The event will be held on Saturdays at 10 p.m., and includes 90 minutes of jump time, loud music, two pizza slices and a soda. The teens can shoot hoops in Sky Slam, play Ultimate Dodgeball or dive into the Foam Zone with their friends.

Sky Zone also hosts other special events, such as Sensory Night on Mondays, which launches on April 4. The evening, which runs from 6 to 8 p.m., is designed specially for jumpers who are autistic or have other special needs. The music is low, and staff have received training from the Canucks Autism Networkto create a safe and welcoming atmosphere for the jumpers. Caregivers only pay half price.

The indoor trampoline park is a short drive across the Pattullo Bridge, and an even shorter SkyTrain ride. The park is right across from Scott Road SkyTrain station, making it a 15-minute ride from Metrotown.

But when you factor in cross-continent culture and property issues, family law becomes a lot more challenging.

For George Lee, founder and principal lawyer at George Lee Law Corporation, dealing with the cultural aspect of family law with his Asian clients is nothing new.

article continues below

“Many of our clients have property both here in Canada and overseas,” George explains. “We have to understand the legal and property system of both countries. Occasionally, we need to hire a lawyer in China to help us in that jurisdiction.”

Divorce and separation issues are always emotionally charged and clients are not always reasonable in their demands.

“In a heated situation, I will typically ask both parties to cool down and consider the well-being of their children first,” George says. “Sometimes I’m able to help the couple through their issues and out of the divorce altogether.”

George is also a certified life coach and an NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) practitioner. His training and experience in these areas help him identify issues and refer his clients to other support services.

“It’s a lawyer’s duty to talk to other mediation or counselling providers before advising their clients to proceed with divorce,” he says.

Not surprisingly, George considers those situations that end up in court to be the most difficult for the participants in the divorce negotiation process.

“I never recommend litigation,” he says. “It’s emotionally draining, particularly difficult for the children, and expensive. My philosophy is to win by not fighting. Negotiate, compromise, and give your money to your children, not to your lawyer.”

If there’s truly no chance of a reconciliation, George recommends drawing up a separation agreement.

“If we can get to a written separation agreement, often we’re dealing with another lawyer and we can both work together to reach a point where our clients feel comfortable enough to make a verbal agreement. From there, we simply put it in writing.”

George Lee Law Corporationstands out amongst their competitors as lawyers who prefer not to fight court battles.

“There’s a perception that lawyers like to go to court and fight over money,” George says. “But that’s not what we do. Compromise is the key to helping our clients through a very emotionally difficult time.”

Constant Pain Eased by Acupuncture,[],,"The Guardian online newspaper recently surveyed their readers on the effects of acupuncture on their ailments. Of the 144 respondents, 96 confirmed that acupuncture was effective in helping ease their pain where painkillers had failed.

Scientific studies to determine exactly how acupuncture is effective are still ongoing. But functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has found that acupuncture stimulates the limbic system of our brains, the area associated with emotion.

“Acupuncture affects serotonin, norepinepherine and dopamine,” says Helen Tong, co-owner of Pure 5 Wellness Hub in Burnaby. “These neurotransmitters communicate orders from your brain to your body. Acupuncture improves this communication or solves communication problems.”

The 5000-year-old key component of Traditional Chinese Medicine went into decline until Mao Zedong brought traditional Chinese values to the fore in the 1950s. From there, acupuncture grew in popularity once more and new methods were soon developed.

Acupuncture for anxiety, ear problems, facial treatments, and acne have been popularized with new research and developments. Acupuncture treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee is now covered by insurers in Germany. The IRS allowed acupuncture to be a deductible medical expense back in the 1970s.

As a form of alternative medicine, acupuncture was occasionally dismissed by the general public as an unproven healing practice. Fortunately, most professionals today have seen and experienced the benefits of acupuncture first-hand.

“Everyone should consider acupuncture,” says Keith Tong, husband of Helen and co-owner of Pure 5 Wellness Hub. “While it’s commonly used for pain relief, it can be used for a variety of conditions. My acupuncturist specializes in anti-aging facial acupuncture, for example. It’s a natural form of Botox.”

The Mayo Clinic advocates the use of acupuncture because there are very few adverse side effects and they are rarely painful or debilitating. New developments include electrified needles, clusters of needles at certain points, and even leaving a needle stuck in the skin for a week.

Vancouver acupuncturists undergo certification through province-wide licensing programs. In provinces where there is no government regulation or official certification, a professional may connect with the local chapter of the Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association of Canada. The World Health Organization recommends 2,500 hours of specialized training for non-physicians and 200 for licensed physicians.

Conversely, if you are not taking care of your teeth, you could be in for serious problems down the road, including a few that you might not have considered.

article continues below

According to Dr. Lalani, here are five problems you could face in the not-too-distant future simply by neglecting your oral health:

1. Your confidence could take a hit—It’s no secret that a healthy-looking smile boosts one’s self-esteem. But the opposite is also true. Poor dental health will not only diminish one’s appearance—and confidence—it can lead to bad breath, as well.

2. You could render your teeth less effective—Neglecting your teeth today can severely impact your ability to eat the foods your love in the future. Imagine not being able to bite into an apple or chew a steak!

3. It could affect your heart—While researchers don’t yet fully understand the link between heart health and oral health, there appears to be a correlation between heart disease and gum disease. At the very least, regular visits to the dentist could potentially help to identify warning signs of heart problems.

4. It could affect your unborn baby—It is very important for pregnant women to pay close attention to oral health as hormonal changes can lead to a variety of problems such as bleeding gums and pregnancy gingivitis. Women with poor oral health have increased risks of delivering a pre-term baby, or of developing pregnancy-related hypertension.

In fact, women may be at a higher risk than men due to the sheer societal views of sleep apnea.

Marina Abramskey, a Registered Respiratory Therapist at CanSleep Services, says women are less likely to report snoring due to embarrassment, and may even under-report it to their physician. “Women often associate it as a ‘men’s’ disease, and are unaware that other symptoms can be the cause of sleep apnea,” she said.

There are different types of sleep apnea with various symptoms. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the most common form; it is a breathing disorder that is caused by a blockage in the pharynx, at the back of the throat, obstructing airflow. It can cause patients to stop breathing repeatedly throughout their sleep.

Women experience different, subtler symptoms of sleep apnea than men do. Abramskey said women are more likely to experience morning headaches, fatigue and tiredness, depression, and insomnia, rather than snoring or waking gasping, which are more common in men. “Because of the different symptoms experienced by women – mainly tiredness and insomnia – they are more likely to attribute it to taking care of the household and children, or even a stressful job rather than sleep apnea,” Abramskey added.

In both the medical and non-medical worlds, sleep apnea was traditionally seen as a men’s condition. However, as physicians become more educated on women’s symptoms, Abramskey said more women are being referred for sleep studies. So far, the studies have shown that women’s anatomies are different and therefore, women’s apnea and hypopneas are also different. “Women might experience shorter apneas and more in REM sleep,” Abramskey said.

As the medical field progresses with its studies on women and sleep apnea, Abramskey said it is especially important for women to report any sleep apnea symptoms to their physicians, or to consult the Registered Respiratory Therapists at CanSleep Services.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

This follows my blog about Brianne Amira, who said an E-Comm 911 operator “berated” her on the phone after calling for police help. (You can read that story here.)

article continues below

Al (he doesn’t want his last name used) contacted the NOW about two incidents in which he called the Burnaby RCMP non-emergency line.

Both calls left him unhappy with how he was treated.

“Once I called the line because I was almost hit by a speeding vehicle when I was in the middle of a zebra crossing,” Al said. “Another time was that my car was almost hit by another car without yielding while I was already in the roundabout. Both times, the operator tried to talk me out of it by saying that if I file a report and police get involved, I would have to go to court and be interviewed by police. And they asked me if I wanted the ‘trouble.’ When I said I was willing, then she said they did not usually send the officer if that only one time the driver made a bad choice.

“I think there is a systematic habit of the Burnaby RCMP non-emergency operators trying to avoid any work.”

That’s a serious charge to make, but that’s the way the operators came across to him.

I contacted the E-Comm 911 communications department and shared these concerns and received a statement.

“Any time E-Comm receives a complaint about our services, we escalate concerns to the appropriate department for full investigation,” a statement said. “In terms of call-taking or dispatch complaints, these are investigated by our internal Quality Assurance department and reviewed by members of our senior operations leadership team, who will review the call and provide a summary of their findings. Our staff are highly-trained, dedicated professionals who are proud to support our communities and emergency service partners. They are here to help 24/7 – a responsibility our staff do not take lightly. If an investigation concludes that an incident was not handled well at any point in the call-handling process, E-Comm will determine whether changes to policy or amendments to our training program need to be made. If follow-up is required with an employee, we will have their supervisor or manager review the call with them to provide coaching or to take additional steps as required – including, where warranted, appropriate discipline. Without having any of the call details related to the two examples you included in your email, I cannot comment or speculate on what may or may not have transpired. If the callers would like to reach out to us directly so our team can look into their concerns, please have them email details to talktoecomm@ecomm911.ca.”

So please keep this in mind. The calls are recorded and, as in the case with Brianne Amira, E-Comm agreed with her about the operator’s performance.

Please also remember the stress these operators are under on a daily basis.

Re: ‘Screeching’ SkyTrain noise in Burnaby

article continues below

I read the recent articles in the NOW about residents complaining about SkyTrain noise. I, too, have tried to get some action taken on this, with no success to date.

I live in a building behind the BC Hydro tower and one side of our suite faces the tracks going to and from the Edmonds station, but also, worse yet, the SkyTrain maintenance yard.

When we moved here, we of course expected some noise from the trains passing during service hours. Annoying as that is at times, we knew what we were getting in that regard.

What we couldn't have anticipated was the fact that the trains are moved around the maintenance yard for cleaning and serviced literally all night long. Every time a train is moved, it emits a loud, high-pitched screeching sound that is ear-splitting. I do not exaggerate in saying this happens the entire night every night.

Here's a video I shot a year ago from my bedroom window just before 3 a.m.

During warmer nights, if I want to keep my window open for some fresh air, I have to wear earplugs to sleep because the high-pitched noise is so loud, it keeps me from being able to sleep.

I complained to TransLink and got a canned response. I complained to the city and was told that TransLink is not subject to municipal noise bylaws.

What?

Can you think of any other business that is allowed to make whatever noise they want in a residential area all night, every night?

I even met the mayor and a councillor at a community event and mentioned it to them. They followed up and connected me with someone else at TransLink and received another canned response.

There has to be some amount of balance between the needs of TransLink to move their trains and the rights of nearby residents to some amount of peace and quiet in their homes after service hours.

I would welcome contact from anyone who would like to organize to try to effect some change on this issue.

Dear shoppers: While the rules are slowly being relaxed regarding limits on how many people are allowed in a business, don't forget that social distancing still applies.

article continues below

Please check the signage before you enter a business and remember that any business that wants to stay open has to abide by the rules as they are told to, and it is not the sole decision of the individual business owners or employees.

The rules apply to everyone and no businesses are intentionally trying to cause an inconvenience for shoppers. Don't expect the same rules wherever you go; some places count individual customers, some count groups of people up to a certain limit; some count couples as two individuals and some count them as one.

Some businesses request customers to wait outside if they are at capacity, so please have patience with staff and other shoppers; you will be called in. (This is also the procedure at the medical labs if you go for a test.)

Interrupting staff while they are helping someone else only causes a delay for everyone. If you phone a business and they don't pick up right away, phone back in a few minutes rather than right away.

Lastly, put enough money in the parking meter because you never know if you will encounter an unexpected delay; give yourself time to have a good shopping experience.

Michel Ladrak, president and general manager, BC Rapid Transit Company, issued a public letter to New Westminster residents last week (read about it here) apologizing for excessive noise along the route.

article continues below

Ladrak promised that grinding work is set to begin soon that will hopefully reduce noise issues. Grinding the tracks helps reduce the noise of the SkyTrain cars.

“Anne in Burnaby” has the same complaints.

She contacted me about the increased noise from SkyTrain she says is happening just east of Metrotown.

“The SkyTrain noise echoes throughout the neighbourhood and is absolutely awful,” said Anne, who didn’t want her last name used. “When we moved in last year, we could slightly hear the trains, but now there is a very loud screeching sound, especially from the trains going west of Royal Oak Station.”

In New West, some residents actually started a petition about the noise.

I’m sure some people will read this and say, “Well, don’t move next to SkyTrain.”

Well, that’s not a fair response. Most of the new housing is being built near SkyTrain for obvious reasons. And, as Ladrak said in his letter, noise can increase in different section of the track so it seems fair to complain when it gets worse.

“The rail surface can become corrugated or pitted after the repeated passing of train wheels, which is largely the cause of noise,” said Ladrak. “The rail grinding was originally scheduled for April as part of our regular maintenance. Our rail grinding contractor is based in the U.S. and due to COVID-19 has been unable to mobilize in Canada. Our own grinding machine is currently undergoing repairs and is expected to be back in service in mid-July. It will be deployed immediately to sections of rail that are in urgent need of grinding.”

“The noise from the trains we can deal with but the loud screeching sound of the wheels we cannot,” said Anne. “Me and my husband are thinking of moving out of the area. It is that bad.”

The current session of the B.C. legislature is exhibit A in support of that thesis.

article continues below

The legislative chamber is often so empty, I half expect to start hearing echoes when I watch the proceedings on Hansard television. In order to enforce physical distancing, there can only be a maximum of 25 MLAs in the chamber at any one time and that occurs usually only during Question Period three times a week.

Everyone else participates in debates via Zoom chats, with the speaker or the chair calling on individual MLAs who are hunkered down at their office desks whenever it is their turn to speak (and occasionally reminding them to unmute their mic).

In terms of getting work done – passing bills and reviewing ministry spending plans – the new approach has been a success, with few glitches. Kudos to the house leaders, the clerks and Speaker Darryl Plecas for making it work.

However, the lack of human interaction is having a noticeable impact on political discourse - the normal cut and thrust of debate that traditionally frames B.C. politics.

“I’m Zoomed out,” said Dan Davies, the BC Liberal MLA from Peace River, told me last week. “It’s so tiring and you’re just sitting there, talking to a computer all day.”

Government House Leader Mike Farnworth agreed with that assessment and noted energy levels had dropped in this unusual, virtual session.

“You just don’t have the same atmosphere. You don’t pick up on the body language from those across the floor,” he said. “Everyone’s using scripts, there’s not a lot of spontaneity and you can’t get a read on anyone.”

BC Liberal MLA Jas Johal – Richmond-Queensborough - said the current Question Period bears no resemblance to pre-pandemic ones.

“Personally, I would much rather see the whites of a minister’s eyes when I’m challenging them,” he told me. “Video will never replace that.”

The public gallery seats are empty as the legislature building remains closed. The hallways are quiet.

Even press gallery members remain out of sight in the Speaker’s Corridor or the press theatre, where the news conferences and ministerial and opposition availabilities occur. Reporters are hooked up via a phone line and a pool TV camera operator records the proceedings.

A challenge facing every legislative body right now is appearing relevant in a pandemic that shattered the world economy, led to millions of people being out of work and continues to pose a dangerous health threat.

The B.C. legislature is not immune from that challenge. Politicians have to take care not to appear to be politicians in the traditional sense.

This is a particularly difficult issue for opposition parties to address. The BC Liberals have to walk a fine line between raising issues of legitimate importance and others that might have been raised in the past, but now seem rather pointless.

And they now have to walk that line in a virtual world, which allows for political debate to occur, but only in a dull, emotionless process.

As we slowly adapt to the pandemic, we will find our “new normal” in all kinds of places. Eventually, we will find it in B.C. politics as well and that is when the liveliness will return.

I’ve read too many statistics about people being killed or maimed while riding one. When a motorcyclist crashes or is hit by another vehicle, being on a bike is unforgiving. The rider is left more vulnerable than being in a car or truck.

So I have sympathy for motorcyclists. Multiple motorcyclists have been killed in Burnaby, including at least five since 2018.

But my sympathy ends when I see motorcyclists engaging in dangerous, entitled behaviour. You know what I mean by entitled. They feel because their bikes are skinny that they can squeeze in between lanes of traffic, especially when they don’t want to wait in a line-up of vehicles.

And then there is the person pictured above or in the two videos below (captured on dash cam by Tristan Calvo). This motorcyclist didn’t want to wait behind a few vehicles stopped in Burnaby at Marine so they hopped the curb and rolled right on by them.

It’s dangerous to themselves, other drivers and to a pedestrian or cyclist who might come around that hidden corner by the stop sign. Hedges block the view of the motorcyclist so they can’t see if someone is coming around that corner.

Just stop it.

Just wait in line the rest of us.

Riding a motorcycle is dangerous enough without having a death wish. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.

At least two people will die in motorcycle crashes on B.C. roads each weekend this summer, if this year follows the same trend as other years.

There were 51 deaths related to motorcycle crashes in the province in 2018 — the highest number recorded in the past decade, according to a B.C. Coroners Service report.

Prior to 2018, there was an average of about 35 deaths a year, ranging from 26 in 2012 to 48 in 2009. There were 34 deaths in 2017.

“We were surprised to see such a big jump from 2017 to 2018 in terms of the number of deaths,” said Andy Watson, manager of strategic communications for the B.C. Coroners Service.

He noted that the count includes any death resulting from a crash that involved a motorcycle and could include a pedestrian or a passenger or driver of another vehicle. Most deaths, however, were motorcyclists.

An August 2018 Coroners Service report found that motorcyclist speed and impairment were the leading contributing factors in motorcyclist deaths that year. Motorcyclist error and inexperience contributed to about 10 per cent of deaths.

Seniors are those Canadians who have suffered through World Wars and the Great Depression. They have survived by hard work and savings for their retirement. Their savings and investments have been severely affected by COVID-19 and now they are subject to reduced income from investments and possibly faced with selling their residences during a real estate downturn.

Seniors count and are important to Canada, having contributed significantly to the growth of the economy and values of freedom, diversity and equality for all. It is now time for the Trudeau government to come to the table and top up pensions for seniors for an appropriate monthly amount under various COVID-19 programs.

On the day Finance Minister Carol James announced a $12.5 billion deficit, the combined effect of an economic meltdown and $6.26 billion in supports to date, a polling company released details of a huge jump in approval ratings for how the B.C. government has stick-handled the pandemic.

article continues below

Meanwhile, the BC Liberals are weighing in with a hefty criticism of the government’s economic recovery plan, and trying to get their voices heard above the fray.

In a press release issued today Wednesday, Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson stated that under the BC NDP-government’s watch, the province has amassed the largest deficit in British Columbia’s modern history.

He contends that this year’s deficit has increased by 27.6%, or $2,643 for every British Columbian, while household incomes are estimated to fall by approximately 3.9% in 2020.

James, however, maintains that B.C.’s safe restart plan is “creating signs of hope for our economy as consumer confidence increases.”

Wilkinsons argues the economic recovery plan is lacking because “there will be no change in the government spending priorities” and the strategy is “simply unsustainable.”

Source: Insights West Graphic

Still, the Insights West poll suggests the government has got a lot of wriggle room in its appeal to British Columbians, noting that the BC NDP has approved its rating during the pandemic, with Premier Horgan himself ratcheting up his approval rating by 17% to 68%, “a higher level higher than for any political leader in B.C. since tracking began 8 years ago.”

Meanwhile, Insights West said its online poll — which ran from June 24-28 among 830 B.C. residents — shows opposition parties are having a difficult time catching the attention of B.C. voters.

The poll found Wilkinson’s approval rating has dropped five points since November to 30%. Interim Green leader Adam Olsen has made his debut at a 29% approval rating — the lowest of any Green leader since the 2017 election, and 44% of B.C. residents don’t know enough about him to provide a rating. Trevor Bolin from the BC Conservative Party, meanwhile, has an 18% approval rating, but similarly, 49% of British Columbians didn’t know enough about him to provide a rating.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

But with so many meeting venues to choose from, and so many things that can go wrong, it can be difficult to choose an appropriate location.

We asked Virna Yu, Marketing and Sales Director of Hilton Vancouver Metrotown for advice on how to plan a winning conference.

article continues below

She responded with the following 8 tips (and also explained why Hilton Vancouver Metrotown is the perfect choice for your next business gathering):

1. Location. Having easy access to major transportation facilities, as well as being close to the city centre, are typically key things to look for when choosing a meeting venue. Hilton Vancouver Metrotown is only 20 minutes to downtown and 20 minutes to the airport, for example. It’s also walking distance to the SkyTrain.

2. Flexible space: What’s the capacity and how flexible is the meeting space? With 14 flexible meeting rooms, as well as the biggest ballroom, biggest foyer and one of the few large outdoor terraces in Burnaby, Hilton Vancouver Metrotown can accommodate groups up to 800. Its 6,300-square-foot Crystal Ballroom can fit more than 500 for a sit-down dinner and 700 for a reception.

3. Flexible menus. You want to have options when it comes to food. At Hilton Vancouver Metrotown, you can mix and match from a huge assortment of meal options and even have “theme” menus – such as Mexican, Chinese or Japanese – to add some international flavour.

4. Affordability: Meeting at a venue in Burnaby means you have easy accessibility to downtown, with downtown amenities and service, but you’re not paying downtown pricing – for food, rooms or parking. That’s important.

5. Access to shopping. If your family is joining you, they’ll likely be looking for things to do around town while you’re busy with co-workers. At Hilton Vancouver Metrotown, Metropolis at Metrotown – the largest mall in B.C. – is just a few blocks away. That means plenty of nearby places for shopping and eating.

6. First-class dining. How good is the onsite restaurant? With the hiring of Executive Sous Chef Dennis Peckham, winner of Chopped Canada, Hilton Vancouver Metrotown revamped its menu, offering an extraordinary culinary experience.

7. Award-winning service. What are others saying about the customer service? Hilton Vancouver Metrotown is regularly voted the Best Hotel in Burnaby by the readers of Burnaby Now.

8. Incentives. Is there any additional benefit for booking with a particular hotel? When you book at Hilton during certain times of the year, you can choose from a suite of rewards including Hilton HHonour Rewards, Airline miles, complimentary parking, hotel gift certificates and discounted shopping cards.

When it comes to arranging your funeral, choosing funeral services with flexibility means not having to worry about leaving complications behind.

You can’t take it with you when you go, but you can take your funeral with you if you move – at least, if you have a pre-arranged funeral with Dignity Memorial®, according to Andrew Knapman, Location Manager at Forest Lawn Funeral Home in Burnaby.

“If a person who purchases a pre-need funeral here at Forest Lawn moves to the Interior or Ontario, or moves to Texas or any one of the States, there’s a funeral home close to them that can utilize that pre-need funeral,” he explains. “So they don’t have to cancel.”

The National Transferability program is available to any clients who live more than 160 kilometres from where they made their arrangements when they pass away. The pre-arranged funeral services are fully transferable.

Dignity Memorial® can also help families if someone with a pre-arranged funeral dies while travelling. The network can connect family members with a funeral home in the area that can arrange the transportation of the deceased loved one. The family just has to cover the transportation fee.

“If a death occurs when they’re travelling away from home, a funeral home there will assist them at no extra charge,” Knapman says.

Making funeral arrangements in advance can help families avoid piling stress on top of grief when they lose someone. But it’s best to make sure those arrangements will still work if you move away or go adventuring. It’s one more way to ensure the people you love don’t have to scramble to honour your wishes.

Forest Lawn Funeral Home and Ocean View Funeral Home in Burnaby are part of the Dignity Memorial® network, which links more than 2,000 funeral service providers throughout North America.

But BOSS Business Centres offers many ways to grow steadily, without taking unnecessary risks.

Many people start their small businesses at home, but there can be issues with portraying an image of professionalism in that environment, according to BOSS owner Julian Clark.

“They're at home, they don't really want to use their home address on their website because someone's going to Google it and they're going to see kids playing street hockey out front, which isn't very professional,” he points out. BOSS Business Centres has a number of office space and service options designed to help small businesses bloom and expand, he adds. There are five steps smaller companies and start-ups can take at BOSS Business Centres, moving their business out of the basement and into a successful, professional space, according to Julian.

1. Address appeal. Many home-based businesses suffer from a lack of professional curb appeal. Start off by using BOSS’s corporate mailbox service, giving companies a great image and brand at a location based outside of the home.

2. Call it in. Next, add phone services to the address rental. BOSS can forward calls directly to your cell, or they can have staff answer and qualify calls before connecting you. It adds another professional aspect to a small business, at a nominal price.

3. Hold a meeting. Even home-based business owners need to hold the occasional meeting in person. BOSS allows clients to rent its boardroom by the hour, giving entrepreneurs a luxury, professional space to conduct business. “This sure beats a Starbucks, when meeting a potential client,” Julian says.

4. Part-time pro. Whether you’re a freelancer who needs a little peace and quiet to work, or a therapist who needs to provide clients with privacy, an office away from home is key. BOSS rents a number of offices on an hourly basis.

5. Month to month. Business is booming, and you’re ready to move into your own professional space. You want to take the leap, but you’re nervous about the commitment of opening an office. Luckily, Boss rents its offices on a month-to-month basis, and provides professional services such as a receptionist and high-speed Internet. Clients can grow and change spaces as needed. BOSS Business Centres has had a number of clients start out using virtual office services, who are now long-term tenants, according to Julian, which works out well for everyone.

“Their success is our success,” he says. BOSS Business Centres is located at 3292 Production Way in Burnaby. For more information on how Boss Business Centres can help your small business expand, go to their website or email BOSS directly.",[]

Miss CEO Nail Salon takesa conscious and clean approach to beauty, using non-toxic nail polishes and waterless hand and foot care using a medical pedicure machine—making it the first of its kind in B.C. to do so.

Not only are the cosmetic treatments safe and 100% bacteria-free, but they also guarantee long-lasting results.

After all, water and nail polish have never been friends.

If you’re fed up with paying for a gel manicure, only to have it chip a week later, the waterless method can help. That’s because your nail temporarily expands after your hands are soaked, which causes the nail polish to buckle and chip once your nail returns to its original shape.

Instead, Miss CEO Nail Salon will use a electrical device equipped with a rotating burr that hygienically and gently files away tough skin in less time than with a standard file.

Enjoy longer-lasting silky feet while saving water and the planet with this European pedicure technology, available exclusively at Miss CEO Nail Salon at 835 Drake Street in Yaletown.

The results are an overall more sedentary lifestyle for many, and the loss of passions and hobbies focused on being active and getting outside into nature.

Addressing this challenge and allowing students to learn to enjoy the great outdoors is Urban Academy, a private JK- Grade 12 school located in the Lower Mainland. With a new 50,000-square-foot campus, students have ample space to learn, grow and explore in their 20,000 square feet of rooftop play spaces. Students are encouraged to incorporate activity into their daily lives, and are introduced to all kinds of new opportunities for athletics and outdoor education.

The new campus features a 4,000-plus square foot full-sized gymnasium to accommodate any physical activity, intramural competitions, tournaments assembly or other multi-purpose needs. The school supports a diverse range of sports for its students to participate in, ranging from team sports such as soccer, volleyball and basketball, to fencing and track and field.

Complementing the new campus and gym is the school’s Outdoor Education Program. Linking activities such as rock climbing with math, or mountain exploration to biodiversity, students are able to apply their knowledge directly to the real world in a stimulating and exciting environment. Urban Academy recognizes the importance of physical activity and strives to help each student reach their full potential. Field trips to Mount Seymour and Whistler help to inspire students to challenge themselves physically and mentally, while growing their self-confidence. Allowing students to experience new and challenging opportunities such as zip lining, belaying or white-water survival skills, enables them to learn and be proud of what they are capable of, and how to approach a new challenge head-on.

Says Cheryle Beaumont, Urban Academy’s Head of School: “All of our kids get lots of outdoor exercise but we really focus on the middle school years for the outdoor education program. Students just came back from a leadership camp in Whistler. They’ve done skiing, snowshoeing, kayaking, rock-climbing and they learned to play golf. We want them to handle and use recreational opportunities out in the community.”

“We try to extend academic learning through some of these activities. When we go to winter camp they’re doing science camp in the outdoors. We just did a geology trip up the Coast. The concepts they’re learning are not just at a desk or something they can Google, but they’re things that actually exist in the real world,” says Beaumont.

Urban Academy values success outside the classroom walls as well as on the academic front. In addition to physical education, Urban Academy students also strive for academic excellence. In partnership with a strong academic performance, the school is proud to value science, technology, physical education and the arts equally. The school’s graduates have an impressive 100 per cent post-secondary acceptance rate.

Tsen, who has a developmental disability, is usually restricted to one-word, verbal responses.

article continues below

But when he sits down and picks up a paintbrush at Alternative Creations Studio in East Vancouver, he enters a world where the strokes he makes across a canvas give form to his unique expressions.

“The studio has provided a way for the artists to connect with the community and a way for them to communicate. It’s really about visual communications - communicating through art,” says Ross Birdwise, Art Facilitator at the studio, which is run by posAbilities. This community living organization supports children and adults with developmental disabilities to lead meaningful and healthy lives, by building an inclusive community where all persons are welcomed and valued for who they are and for the contributions they make.

Tsen and his fellow artists, selected by a referral from Community Living BC, come almost daily to the studio to create their works in a social setting.

Birdwise says Tsen’s studio time is meditative and calming.

“I think he finds making these works relaxing overall and there is a contemplative aspect to them that I think translates into the completed works and how a viewer might relate to them,” he explains. “There is a lot left unsaid in them, and they are very ambient and atmospheric. I believe they are non-representational. There is mysteriousness to them, not just in how or why they are made but also in how they might appear to a viewer.

“His work method is also like a transfer of energy because his art is not representational, but very much to do with how he is in the world.”

And Tsen’s artistic efforts allow his nature to shine through.

“Oh yeah, absolutely. I think with Chris, a lot of other aspects of his personality come out because his works are really abstract.”

Birdwise adds he’s worked with Tsen for quite a while and sees their relationship at times as a dialogue, which is more akin to making music with its form sometimes left open to chance and improvisation.

“With Chris the making of the art, the process itself, seems to be more important than the finished product,” Birdwise says. “Sometimes I think there is no sense of a work being finished for him, no grand kind of goal, form or outcome being sought after.

“This isn’t a weakness, it is an integral part of his artistic expression.”

And that, along with those of his fellow artists, will be on display at posAbilities’s 15th Annual Inclusion Art Show on Oct. 10 at Heritage Hall in Vancouver (3102 Main St.).

That’s how posAbilities, a Burnaby-based service provider, defines shared living with persons who have developmental disabilities.

For posAbilities, this service is much more than simply providing a safe and caring place to stay when a family is matched with an individual in the community to care for them. It’s a link between people that can extend further.

article continues below

Shared living is similar to foster care for those who aren’t familiar with the concept. Only distinct in that families are welcoming adults into their homes and lives. Although caregivers are compensated for the support they provide, it isn’t the main reason they take on this much needed service. The Association’s caregivers include families with children, same sex couples, singles or roommates.

“It goes beyond just sharing a home. That’s why we refer to our version of shared living as sharing a life,” said Louise Blackwell, manager of shared living at posAbilities, which supports individuals in homes stretching from Squamish to Abbotsford.

Caregivers often embrace the newest member of their household as one of the family, and go beyond what is expected. “We see folks thriving in new roles – like becoming a child’s auntie, or a youth’s big brother; right through to exploring the world and travelling overseas. The opportunities out there for people are amazing,” says Blackwell.

Equally amazing is the feeling of kinship that can manifest itself when posAbilities introduces people who truly are the perfect match for each other – their personalities, interests and lifestyles. One family in the posAbilities network is celebrating 20 years together, while about 60 to 70 percent of the families, have lived together for 10 or more years.

posAbilities emphasizes that a good match centers on a healthy amount of give and take in the relationship. “I think a lot of people who open their homes and lives come into this thinking they are the expert. Yet they come away knowing they have learned so much more, either about the person they are contracted to support, or about themselves,” Blackwell explained. “It’s definitely a two-way street,” she added. “There’s compromise, learning and growing.” It is after all, life sharing.

Real Estate Wire (REW), one of Canada’s leading digital real estate platforms, is expanding their well-established listings portal to include rentals. The website, which has been trusted by real estate buyers and sellers for the better part of a decade, will offer a number of tools and resources to help renters find their next home.

“Renting is an important part of the real estate market for many families, especially in cities like Vancouver and Toronto, where affordability is a major issue,” said Simon Bray, REW President. “Over the years, we have seen an increasing need for a rental platform that is safe, secure, and provides renters with the same great service as buyers. That’s why we’ve expanded our real estate marketplace to include rentals.”

The Lower Mainland is one of the world’s most expensive real estate markets for buyers, driving many families to look for affordable rentals as an alternative. The COVID-19 pandemic has further impacted the buying power of many families.

A recent REW survey found that 45% of respondents had either lost their job or some income due to the pandemic. About 38% of survey respondents said that COVID-19 had negatively affected their financial ability to buy a home.

“The shift to include rental properties on our platform has been in the works for some time, but the pandemic has really accelerated the demand for this service,” added Bray.

“Our goal is to help Canadians find their next home. Whether it’s buying a new development, browsing a listing down the street, or finding a great rental apartment, REW delivers a comprehensive real estate experience for everyone.”

In addition to listings, renters will have access to videos, virtual tours, market insights, and detailed descriptions of the rental properties, including their location, nearby schools, and amenities.

With the uncertainty surrounding the future of COVID-19 and its impact on the real estate market, these resources will become increasingly important to families that want to shop for a home online. About 80% of survey respondents believe websites like REW are now a critical resource, with 90% reporting having used a website like rew.ca in the last 30 days.

REW is working exclusively with property management companies to ensure rental properties are vetted and meet REW’s quality management standards.

“Our position in the real estate market has enabled us to establish strong relationships with the top property management companies in Canada. When using our platform, renters can rest assured they are receiving quality listings that have been reviewed by industry professionals.”

There are currently over 10,000 rental listings available on REW in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. Expansion plans to bring rental listings across Canada are in the works.

Burnaby Neighbourhood House operates two Neighbourhood Houses that are making a difference in people’s lives.

“Loneliness can also be an equalizer,” says Antonia Beck, Executive Director of the Burnaby Neighbourhood House. “We’re breaking down the class system and meeting people where they’re at. Everybody has different issues at some point, and everybody needs to feel like they belong.”

Although the Burnaby Neighbourhood House’s outreach programs target two key demographics: young families and seniors, it also ensures that all staff and program areas have a mandate of increasing awareness and connecting individuals to local programs and supports.

Outreach workers create awareness about the affordable programs available to families with young children such as family drop-ins, baby health care clinics, food banks, and other valuable resources such as supporting government form filling.

“We want them to know about the resources in their community, and introduce them to free and affordable things to do,” says Beck.

These resources can be in the form of drop-in activities or regular programs held at the Neighbourhood House itself, or at schools, libraries and community agencies.

Older adults involved at the Burnaby Neighbourhood House have the opportunity to become volunteer ambassadors where they receive training to become outreach workers.

“They’re trained as a peer helper and in Seniors issues,” says Beck. “They are given the important task of going out in the community and finding other seniors who might be lonely and in need of support, and they tell them about the Neighbourhood House. Word of mouth is the best type of advertising.”

Recognizing that isolation is a big issue for seniors, the Neighbourhood House recently received federal funding to allow it to expand and replicate its seniors outreach model throughout Metro Vancouver.

In its 20 years, the house has also formed key partnerships with other organizations and businesses which contributes to the successful work of connecting neighbours to appropriate resources. This is the case, when supporting both new immigrants and longtime residents as they make Burnaby their home.

“We offer many programs like cultural dinners, English classes and support with literacy needs,” says Beck. “Oftentimes, somebody might come in for one thing and suddenly find themselves striking up conversations with others, discovering new things and new friendships. Parents often connect with other parents, seniors connect with other seniors.”

“It’s common for people to start out as participants and become volunteers,” Beck adds. “What’s important is that the residents in our neighbourhood learn about what resources are out there for them.”

That’s why BOSS Business Centres makes sure to give clients a high-quality space and stellar services, but with the warmth of a supportive community, according to owner Julian Clark.

While other business centres are readily available, they can be cold and impersonal with corporate rules and procedures that lead to inflexibility and unpredictable billing, he points out. Their contracts can be difficult to decipher, and they may not be willing to bend on specific needs and wants of the clients. While BOSS Business Centres offers a Class A office space and the professional services that the larger centres offer, BOSS goes above and beyond to ensure their clients feel at home.

“We are very flexible and very accommodating of our clients,” Julian says.

This might include helping a client switch out the furniture in their office for something that works better for them, he adds. BOSS strives to create a friendly atmosphere where connections between clients flourish, but avoids some of the pitfalls of co-working spaces, according to Julian.

Co-working spaces can be less professional and provide less privacy, he explains. Their clientele tends to be more transient and they don’t offer all the services and amenities of a business centre.

“You could pay $300 for a co-working space, or you can spend $300 here and have your own office when you need it,” Julian says. BOSS Business Centres provides the professionalism and quality of the larger, more corporate centres, with the warmth and community of a co-working space, creating the best of both worlds. BOSS often helps clients connect directly, and hosts special get-togethers for everyone in the centre to get to know each other.

“We hold events to bring our clients together, we do muffin days, we do wine and cheese days around Christmas,” Julian says of the centres’ community spirit.

“We’ve done quite a lot for our size,” says senior club member, Vivian, citing programs such as Coats for Kids and activities ranging from graffiti paint-outs to advocating for literacy in underprivileged schools. “Now we’re looking to grow our membership base so that we can help more people and organizations in the communities we serve.”

With 22 members, The Rotary Club of Burnaby Metrotown is made up of business leaders who live or work in Burnaby. Led by current club president, Sue Cheung, they meet every Tuesday at 12:15pm for lunch to build fellowship, hear & learn from outside speakers and to organize community projects.

“We want to be helpful to other people, while offering fellowship for our members,” says Vivian. “We’re a group of fun, active, and committed volunteers—a wonderful, welcoming tight-knit community.”

In keeping with the Rotarian’s guiding principles, The Rotary Club of Burnaby Metrotown employs a four-way test before taking on new initiatives, posing the following four questions at the outset:

Is it the truth? Is it fair to all concerned? Will it build goodwill and better friendships? Will it be beneficial to all concerned?

Projects that align with these core values include a scholarship program for experienced professionals to go abroad and help bring peace to conflicted regions. Also included are a range of local and international programs for youth, as well as health initiatives such as clean water and the eradication of polio worldwide.

Are you looking to have a positive impact on your community… and have fun doing it? The Rotary Club of Burnaby Metrotown is a dynamic group of Rotary volunteers supporting both the local and global community—and having fun.

For Harjit Sandhu with IG Wealth Management, the client – and their individual needs – always takes priority.

article continues below

“Every single client is different, every single client needs solutions specific to their life,” he said. “You have to listen, you have to hear what people need, where they’re going. And that’s what I enjoy: this work is about people, about relationships, ultimately. And at the end of the day I’m making a meaningful impact on someone’s life. That’s a great feeling.”

Sandhu notes that IG Wealth Management – formerly known as Investors Group – has created a reputation for itself because of that personal focus, and their focus on individual needs.

“We do much more than investments, and that’s part of changing our name – to emphasize that spectrum of services,” he said.

For example, clients may be nearing retirement and have questions related to that transition; others may need debt restructuring or suggestions around saving for a child’s education; still others may be focused on estate planning, tax issues, or a mix of many different pieces of their unique puzzle.

Whatever the goals, and wherever the starting point, there’s room for everyone to have guidance.

“To be honest, a lot of this is not taught in schools or by parents the way it might have been in another time,” he said. “Some clients may not have experience with preparing or maintaining a budget. Someone else may have been in save mode their whole life and now they’re retired and need suggestions about what to do with those savings.”

Most of his clients come to him through referrals, which is gratifying.

“If someone is recommending you to a friend or family member, then you know you’ve done a good job for that client,” he said. “We work very hard to be responsive to our clients – to not just give good advice and to hear them and be part of their success, but to be available to them. I’m based in Burnaby but we have a number of offices throughout the Greater Vancouver Area where I can meet someone,” he said.

Ultimately, though, what makes Sandhu and IG Wealth Management stand out is the fact that the focus is always on excellence.

“We do what we say we will do, always, and we do more than our clients are expecting. That’s our promise and we hold to that promise,” he said.

The company, which first opened in 1926, has 100 offices nationally with its headquarters based in Winnipeg and is part of the Power Financial Group of companies, which includes Great West Life Co., Canada Life, Freedom 55, Mackenzie Financial and Putnam Investments. Sandhu notes that IG Wealth Management has a strong commitment to the communities it serves, including being donors or supporters for local-level organizations, such as South Burnaby Neighbourhood House and the Burnaby Rotary Club.

Sandhu’s work in financial planning has been recognized over the years within IG Wealth Management with a variety of awards.

For Dr. Vik Sharma, Burnaby isn’t just the community he grew up in – it’s also now the home-base for his practice, Simply Wellness Dental Burnaby. And he’s ecstatic to be back.

article continues below

“I was born and raised here. This has always been home and always will be,” he said. His roots go deep: his education started in a local preschool, took him through Lochdale Elementary and Burnaby North Secondary, and eventually to Simon Fraser University on Burnaby Mountain. He later graduated from dentistry at UBC – and then left BC for a while.

“I went to Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories, to work as a dentist for five years. Being able to give back to a marginalized community within our own country was a very humbling experience,” he recalls. “I always dreamed of coming home to Burnaby and giving back to the community here. It’s truly a blessing for me to be able to return the favour to everyone who helped or contributed in raising me when I was younger in this community – from volunteers to city workers. This is a great place to live.”

Simply Wellness Dental Burnaby is the culmination of that dream: a dental practice that focuses on quality care, education, and treating each patient as an individual.

“We are focused on the complete systemic dental health care. What that means is that we assess, diagnose and treat the mouth in relation to the entire body,” he said. “Your mouth has direct correlations to heart, brain, immune and pregnancy health. Our goal is to educate our patients on prevention and treat people so that they can live a healthy lifestyle.”

They provide all aspects of dental care from family dentistry, to cosmetic crown and veneer work, invisalign, implants, botox, wisdom teeth removal, sedation and dental care for children, all with the latest in cutting edge technology and highly trained staff.

And though they’re one of the newest clinics in town, they’ve already earned a sterling reputation that is drawing in new patients all the time thanks to their unique approach.

“We often have people tell us ‘Wow, I’ve never been so educated and cared for at a dental clinic before.’ Patients are blown away with the care and comfort that they’re receiving,” he said.

In fact, they’ve garnered more five-star google reviews than any other dental clinic in Vancouver and Burnaby, and have already extended their hours to seven days a week to serve their growing patient base. The team now includes two assistants, a hygienist, a receptionist and an office manager.

“We are a tight-knit, friendly, diverse, energetic group,” he says of his team.

Sharma says he’s excited to see what the future holds.

“I see Simply Wellness Dental being a pillar in the Burnaby community where all are welcome,” he said, saying he hopes to build up strong relationships with his patients and the surrounding community.

At the end of the day, the primary goal is, and will always continue to be, providing top-notch care to those who come through the doors. “Excellence to me means truly making a difference. Striving for that high level of attention and care that I give my patients truly is the road to excellence for me,” he said. “I treat my patients the way that I would expect to be treated, with empathy, respect and kindness.”

There are so many things to consider - location, square footage, what services are included, and what services aren’t.

Businesses ready for their own piece of turf are often most concerned with price, but Julian Clark, owner of BOSS Business Centres, suggests they consider what they’re getting for the cost.

article continues below

“Directly leasing from a commercial landlord generally ties you into a fixed and long term lease, I don't do fixed terms, I do month to month,” he says, explaining that a direct lease of $1,000 or so a month for three to five years is a huge commitment, especially for businesses that are starting out.

And there isn’t much allowance for growth or change during that time, locking tenants into a space that might not be right for them in a year or two, he adds.

While leasing direct might seem cheaper, that isn’t always the case, Julian says. Direct lease will cost less per square foot per year, but a business centre provides many services that would cost extra.

“You're not just getting an office in a business centre,” Julian explains. “You're getting the common area, which makes up a significant per cent of the total square footage of our space. You're getting a receptionist. You're getting high-speed, managed fibre optic Internet, that would cost you $1,000 a month. So this is tapping into the shared economy.”

Businesses have to consider staffing needs, décor, phone and Internet lines, and more when opening an office, he points out. That’s where business centres can help.

“You're not just renting the square footage in the office that you're renting,” Julian says. “You're getting all this other stuff.” BOSS Business Centres is located at 3292 Production Way in Burnaby. For more on what BOSS can offer prospective tenants, email or go to their website.",[]

The grief was overwhelming, and Marilyn describes having regular panic attacks. “We went to a barbecue once, and I actually stood in the middle of this backyard and screamed at the top of my voice,” she recalls.

Marilyn was treated in Royal Columbian Hospital for over a month, followed by support in an outpatient program. “I met the most caring, compassionate people,” recalls Marilyn. “I was also amazed at who else was in the hospital—how many young people, how many ordinary people, people that didn’t seem different. They were just struggling with life.”

Psychiatric care is the centrepiece of phase one of Royal Columbian redevelopment. Construction begins this year on a new Mental Health and Substance Use Wellness Centre. It will provide a significant opportunity for groundbreaking research, increased psychiatric training and state-of-the-art patient care.

At four floors, the centre will offer two and a half times as many beds, including a 20-bed Older Adult Psychiatric Unit—a first for Fraser Health—to serve the unique needs of seniors.

Joyce Kubu-Haynes, now in her 70s, has experienced the benefits of Royal Columbian Hospital’s mental health program firsthand.

Her illness started with anxiety attacks when she was 30. “They were bad,” the Coquitlam resident remembers. “I went to see my doctor, and he said I should be in the hospital.”

She would eventually be diagnosed with schizophrenia, which she now manages with medication.

“I can cope,” she says. “I am out almost every day.”

Outpatient psychiatric care will also benefit from the redevelopment, and the new centre will serve as the hub for mental health education, training and research within Fraser Health.

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

What to look out for

The BBB says consumers should look out for the following red flags is they are searching for a lender or loan broker:

The health authority added the outbreak of C. difficile to its list of current outbreaks on July 14.

article continues below

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Rash

If you are visiting someone who is located on an outbreak unit, visitors may be limited to two people at a time. Fraser Health asks that you do not visit other patient rooms or common areas on the unit such as the lounge and patient kitchenette.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

Gill won the million on Canada’s birthday after purchasing his ticket at the Chevron Town Pantry on 58 Avenue in Surrey.

He says when he initially checked his ticket, he wasn’t quite convinced he was a big winner.

“I checked at the self-checker,” said Gill. “I told my son, and then I had to go to another gas station to make sure it was correct. After I told my wife, they both thought I was joking and didn’t believe me.”

Gill says the $1 million means he can take a step back from work.

“It’ll be nice to not have to work so hard,” laughed Gill. “I’ll still continue to … I want to start my own business.”

On top of starting a new business, Gill will put some of his money towards the new house that he’s building, so the timing of the win is perfect.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

Ronsons – which sold affordable shoes for many years – will not reopen its retail store in Burnaby’s Amazing Brentwood.

article continues below

Ronsons outlets in Burnaby closed in March due to the pandemic and will not reopen again.

It’s a sad end for a company that operated for 32 years, including multiple locations in Burnaby. The stores were known for their affordable array of brands and excellent customer service.

Many online outlets have been steadily eating away at retail store profits and the COVID-19 pandemic is a final nail for many companies.

The entire company, which had 18 stores, is now in receivership, according to the head of the company, Tony Aronson in an emotional Facebook post. It has also closed its head office and warehouse.

“Thirty two years ago, my father and I started Ronsons with our first store in Kerrisdale, Vancouver,” Aronson wrote. “With the help of our incredible staff, loyal customers and supplier partners – many of them friends, we grew the business to eighteen locations. It is with a heavy heart that I have to tell you that due to the Covid-19 pandemic the company is now in receivership. To our loyal staff, customers and suppliers, I thank you for your partnership for so many years. Perhaps out of the ashes, a bright spark will allow us to work together again. Wishing you all my prayers in this difficult time.”

Ronsons has even shut down its website.",[]

I love food, but am not great when it comes to hot spices and so I asked a clerk at HanNam Supermarket in Burnaby last Saturday for some help.

article continues below

I was trying to pick out some gochujang sauce, but many of the labels were in Korean. Some had the English words “super hot” and I definitely didn’t want those so I imposed on this clerk for some interpretation.

I’m always wary of asking staff for help because in many English grocery stores, they usually act like it’s a huge imposition.

At HanNam, however, the staff literally leap across the room to help. The clerk spend a good three minutes going through all of the labels to try and find the “mild” gochujang. At that point, I really felt guilty for taking up his time but he said he understood and that he was partial to milder food.

The clerk finally found what I needed, smiled and went on his way.

That was amazing.

That’s the kind of experience I always have at HanNam, which is located in Burnaby’s Koreatown business district on North Road.

If you haven’t been here before, it’s a hoot. Lots of businesses straddling North Road on the Burnaby/Coquitlam border. There’s restaurants and travel agencies and, of course, HanNam – for me, the centrepiece of the area.

It’s a special time for HanNam because it’s their 17th anniversary. I didn’t realize that and was thrilled at the sale items.

The store has taken great pains to comply with COVID-19 rules, especially when it comes to limiting how many people are inside at any one time.

The man guarding the door and washing all the baskets was a jaunty fellow who chatted with me about government policies and when I thought the pandemic would end (not this year, I said).

“Lots of good prices,” he said. “It’s a special time.”

He meant the anniversary, not COVID-19.

HanNam is the kind of place that makes Burnaby such a wonderful place to live. There are these pockets of cultures that have set up in defined areas, making for a strong sense of community.

Instead, she got cooking.

article continues below

Shamji took the time to travel to India, take cooking classes and develop new recipes for her beloved Safari Snack House and Grill on Canada Way.

“It was a hard time, but I found a way to turn it into a positive,” said Shamji. “Our recipes are even better than before.”

The fire was in 2018 and due to complicated insurance issues, Safari didn’t reopen until February 2020. Shamji was so happy to finally reopen after a long, stressful time.

Things can only get better, she thought.

And then COVID-19 happened.

“It’s like, ‘what’s next,’” Shamji said with a laugh.

But anyone who knows Shamji knows she’s not going to let that stop her and so Safari has transitioned into a thriving takeout business for her delicious samosas, pakoras, tandoori chicken, mishkaki, kebabs and so much more.

It’s taken time, but word has spread to her loyal customers and they have returned in large numbers.

“It has been so wonderful to see people return,” Shamji said.

While many restaurants are returning to sit-down service, Safari will continue to stick with takeout-only service for the time being due to its size. To keep the tables distanced would only allow for three tables and Shamji said that isn’t enough. Safari only allows two customers to be in the restaurant at any given time due to COVID-19 protocols.

Shamji was born in Kampala, Uganda to second-generation immigrants from Gujarat, India. But when Idi Amin's ruthless regime began targeting non-ethnic Ugandans, the family had to flee and they were sponsored to come to Canada.

Shamji has done many things, but found her true calling with Safari.

“I hope my story will inspire other women who come to a new country for a new life,” she said. “I want to empower other women and show them you can succeed. I’ve been through a lot and I’m still standing.”

Safari Snack House and Grill is open every day except Tuesdays and is located at 5121 Canada Way in Burnaby. Read more on Safari's website here.",[]

Nonetheless, with the CE marking in hand as of June 30, the CEO of Burnaby-based Kardium Inc. is now working out a plan to fly with his team to Germany to oversee the launch of the tool aimed at more efficiently treating atrial fibrillation (the European Union is allowing Canadians to travel within its borders, but Americans and Russians, among others, still face restrictions).

article continues below

“They [EU] introduced a whole range of new device rules, which caused every device-maker essentially that was certified in Europe to have to get recertified. So that caused a huge backlog in the approvals process,” said Chaplin, referring to overhauls to the EU’s medical device regulations that went into effect in late May.

“Unfortunately [it took] longer than we expected.”

Kardium’s Globe Mapping and Ablation System had originally gone through a study for certification more than two years ago but only received the coveted CE marking this month.

The company has now formed a branch office in Germany to begin selling the devices stamped with the CE marking to European electrocardiologists treating atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat that can lead to heart clots, strokes and heart failure.

It’s the most common form of arrhythmia, according to the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, affecting an estimated 350,000 Canadians.

The device is about one-metre long and features a handle at one end to control it and an array of electrodes at the other end.

Doctors insert the device into patients via a needle in the groin area and insert a small tube into the femoral vein, through which the device’s electrodes travel up to the heart.

The electrodes map the heart’s activity and then burn tissue inside to create scarring, stop the bad electric signals and return the heart to its normal rhythm.

Current systems feature one electrode.

Kardium’s has 122 electrodes, which can reduce the process from about four hours to about one hour.

The equipment used for current procedures costs about US$8,000 to US$12,000 per procedure.

Kardium’s costs for the one-time-use device will be comparable to that.

Chaplin said he expects sales to begin in Europe in a few weeks, while Kardium plans to undertake a U.S. Food and Drug Administration study next year to pursue certification in North America.

Certification on this side of the pond is still likely about three years away.

All the manufacturing will be done in Burnaby and the company intends to boost its 160-person headcount as manufacturing output increases.

“It’s important for us to control every aspect of the manufacturing of the device. We think we can build a high-quality medical device here in Vancouver rather than outsourcing to some other manufacturer,” Chaplin said, adding the pandemic initially caused some hiccups in the supply chain.

Beyond expanding the manufacturing side of the business, Chaplin said the marketing team will be based on the West Coast while the local engineering team will continue to refine the device’s hardware and software.

“It marks a change of our company from an RnD [research and development] stage into a commercial sales organization,” he said.",[]

The chain of eateries says it lost eight cents per share for the period ended March 29, when 37 per cent of its locations were closed because of the pandemic.

Freshii, which reports in U.S. dollars, earned US$103,000 or zero cents per share in the same quarter a year earlier.

Excluding one-time items, Freshii lost US$1.21 million, compared with a profit of US$597,000 in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue fell to US$4.56 million from US$5.14 million as same-store sales decreased 14.3 per cent, compared with 0.9 per cent growth a year ago.

System-wide sales from its 467 locations in 16 countries came in at US$37.2 million down from US$43.2 million a year ago.

That’s the case for one of Burnaby’s biggest retailers, Indigo Books & Music Inc., which operates out of Metropolis at Metrotown.

Indigo expects at least 10 to 12 months of a ""damaging set of conditions"" from the COVID-19 pandemic, said chief executive Heather Reisman, the day after the company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $171.3 million.

""This pandemic is, to be sure, a seismic, once-in-a-lifetime event,"" Reisman told a conference call with analysts Wednesday. ""For Indigo, like so many others, the impact has been and will continue to be significant.""

She said governments deemed the retailer as non-essential so it was forced to close all 196 of its stores two weeks before the close of its financial year, which ended March 28.

Prior to the closures, the company expected to close its financial year with an essentially flat figure for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, she said.

Indigo had expected the first quarter of its new financial year to be strong, said Reisman, ""putting us back on track to real profitability.""

However, the coronavirus is now impacting that trajectory, she said, noting the company still feels ""truly optimistic"" about its medium-term trajectory.

Business is still steady, but will definitely benefit when many of the restaurants around start to (hopefully) reopen. My routine when eating in Burnaby Heights is to go for dinner and then drop by Glenburn for a shake or a sundae. (Read about their sundaes in my blog here.) But many of the nearby restaurants are either closed or takeout only.

Glenburn is currently being run just by family members, Roberta said, but plans are in the works to slowly add staff again. And the even bigger news is the family business is expanding to a second location.

Roberta and Ron are hoping to open Glenburn Roadside in mid-July just a few blocks east at 4347 Hastings St.

We gives two thumbs up to ice cream for breakfast if they look like this Glenburn creation. INSTAGRAM

Glenburn Roadside will be a takeout window offer a “slimmed-down” menu of items you can just walk up and order. This idea really takes me back to the 1970s in the Burnaby Heights when Dairy Queen had a takeout window set up just across the street.

Roberta likens Glenburn Roadside to “like a roadside stand you’d find on a summer road trip. It’s really a slimmed-down version of Glenburn, almost like a pop-up.”

Glenburn Roadside will also serve as a production kitchen in which Roberta will finally be able to make her own ice cream flavours, as well as in-house brownies, cookies and toppings for sundaes. In addition, they can make dairy-free water ice and vegan ice creams that they haven’t had access to in the past. You’ll also be able to order an ice cream cake and treats to take home for your freezer.

I was listening to all of this and feeling so inspired. It’s a tough time for most businesses, but here’s one that is also making expansion plans.

I will follow up when Glenburn Roadside opens up because I will have to sample their wares.

The trio has also completed their Series A round of financing of a whopping $7 million. Led by venture capital firm Renewal Funds, along with strategic and existing investors, the cumulative funds raised for this five-year-old company is over $10 million to date.

“We’re thrilled to partner with a local company that has strong values and offers products and a service that support the local economy,” said Genevieve Pinto, partner at Renewal Funds, in a news release.

Fresh Prep now delivers tens of thousands of meals each week across the Metro Vancouver, Vancouver Island and Okanagan regions.

“Partnering with local businesses has been a key ingredient to our growth,” said Sood. “We purchase meat locally from Intercity Packers and Rossdown Farms to ensure the freshest local proteins along with seasonally local produce for our customers.”

Fresh Prep also works with other local suppliers to provide additional items such as smoothies, baked goods, snacks and more within their online marketplace to provide additional options to customers, while supporting the local economy. In April, Fresh Prep gave back nearly $10,000 in proceeds to their local suppliers through a special rebate program.

“Post COVID-19, we believe that our customers’ food preferences and cooking habits will remain focused on home-cooked meals and supporting local suppliers,” said Brauer. “With the support of our investors, we are ready to grow to meet customers’ changing needs.”

The new round will go towards hiring more talent and service enhancements for the rollout of Fresh Prep’s 100% reusable meal kit, which will curb the usage of single-use plastics in Fresh Prep meal kits. Fresh Prep will be the only meal kit provider to offer such a product on mass scale in Canada, and this will be a significant step towards Fresh Prep’s goal of becoming a completely zero waste business by 2025.",[]

With the physical distancing requirements imposed by the government and the closure or restriction of various types of businesses, many Burnaby employers are facing plummeting revenues and are not able to continue to employ and pay staff.

The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy will provide eligible businesses with a subsidy of 75% of their wages payable, up to a maximum of $847 per week per employee.

What’s new?

1) To be eligible, businesses will now have to show only a 15% decline in March revenues, whereas previously it required a 30% decline. This is in recognition that many businesses only felt the impacts of COVID-19 in the second half of last month. The threshold for April and May continues to be a 30% decline.

2) Businesses can now choose to compare their revenues for March, April or May with either the same month last year, or with the average of their revenues in January and February of this year. This is an important change that allows new businesses that don’t have a 2019 comparison, and growing business that have increased revenues significantly over 2019, to still have access to this benefit.

article continues below

3) Businesses can now choose to recognize revenue either on a cash basis or on an accrual basis, depending on what makes more sense for each business. This is an important clarity that reflects the differences in accounting methods used by businesses to show revenues.

4) Hidden in the changes is a new 100% rebate of the employer-paid contributions to the Canada Pension Plan and Employment Insurance programs – but only for workers who are furloughed or being paid but not required to work. This is meant to encourage businesses to re-hire staff, even if there is no work for them to do, so that the workers can continue to be paid and stay connected to the employer. Keeping employees engaged with companies will be important for when we reopen the economy.

This program is not without flaws, and the Burnaby Board of Trade is still pushing for broader and faster supports for business, but the 75% wage subsidy with these new changes will help many more businesses continue to operate.

Her message came in response to a report by Electrek.co that over 130 Tesla employees or contractors have tested positive, and hundreds more are waiting for test results. The website said it based the report on internal company data.

Shelby wrote that the story referred to data ""that was in the process of being validated"" and included employees worldwide who may have been infected but never entered a Tesla site, or were infected at home while Tesla's operations were shut down earlier in the year. A Tesla spokesman would not comment on the report or the email, which was obtained by The Associated Press.

""Nearly all — more than 99.99% — of these occurrences were not cases of virus transmitted at work,"" Shelby wrote in the email. ""Most of the positive cases resulted from an individual living with or travelling with someone with COVID-19 and have returned to work after recovering from home.""

Shelby wrote that Tesla doesn't have any employees in serious condition anywhere in the world because of COVID-19.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the numbers from the public health department in Alameda County, California, which includes Fremont, the location of Tesla's only U.S. assembly plant. The factory employs about 10,000 workers.

Some workers have refused to return to the plant out of fear of catching the virus. They did so after CEO Elon Musk in May defied Health Department orders not to restart production under shutdown orders due to the virus.

Some Tesla workers and labour activists say the company is threatening to fire employees who haven’t returned, but Tesla officials have said claims about firings are not true. Workers say they've heard about COVID-19 cases at the plant but they don't know numbers. They have called on the company and health department to release the figures.

However, Shelby wrote in the email that an employee survey found the vast majority of workers feel comfortable with the safety measures being taken by the company.

Among the measures are increased cleaning, limiting access to facilities, temperature checks for employees before they enter buildings, staggered shifts to keep workers apart, additional barriers between employees and providing protective equipment, Shelby wrote.

She urged workers to wear masks or face coverings to stay healthy and save lives and warned that failing to wear masks where required, or not wearing them properly, will bring disciplinary actions. She also wrote that workers should stay home if they're sick.

Musk reopened the Fremont plant May 11 in defiance of county orders. The health department had deemed the factory a nonessential business that can’t fully open under virus restrictions, but Tesla contended it was essential under federal guidelines.

The next day, however, the Health Department announced that the plant could return to manufacturing as long as it delivers on worker safety precautions that it agreed to.",[]

Asa Hutchinson issued an order Thursday requiring people to wear face masks in public throughout the state, which has had a surge in coronavirus cases over the past several weeks.

The Republican governor had resisted a statewide mask mandate and opposed issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the pandemic, but he signed the order requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible in the hopes of slowing the disease's rapid spread in the state. The order takes effect Monday.

Hutchinson’s decision comes amid growing support for mask requirements from business and health leaders and a day after Bentonville-based Walmart said it would require customers to wear masks in all of its U.S. stores. The state’s largest newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, also called for a statewide requirement on Thursday.

Hutchinson previously encouraged people to wear masks and allowed cities to pass ordinances requiring their use, but he stopped short of requiring them statewide. He’s the latest Republican governor to relent on the mask issue in the face of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Alabama's governor issued a similar mask mandate on Wednesday.

Arkansas' coronavirus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen despite warnings from national health officials about the risks of doing so too soon. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that did not issue a broader stay-at-home order that kept most businesses closed.

Hutchinson previously questioned how a mask mandate could be enforced in a rural state such as Arkansas, but this week he left open the possibility of such a requirement. The chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences called for a statewide requirement last weekend.

Hutchinson's order was expected to face criticism from some conservatives in the state. Hours before he issued the order, a Republican legislator urged people to call Hutchinson to oppose any mask directive.

A poll by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business suggested tensions are flaring between workers and employers, with around 27 per cent of 3,389 employers polled indicating some of their laid-off staff have refused to return to work.

article continues below

Of the nearly 870 businesses that provided the reasons their employees gave for refusing to return to work, 62 per cent reported workers ""prefer the Canada Emergency Response Benefit."" Employers could choose more than one explanation for why a worker refused to return, and respondents also selected options such as concern for health (47 per cent), childcare obligations (27 per cent) or lack of hours in return offer (16 per cent).

CFIB president Dan Kelly said it's ""clear"" that CERB ""created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality."" Other sectors where conflicts are arising include child care, dental offices, home health care, amusement parks, gambling and spectator sports, the study suggested.

""CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But Ian Robb, Canadian director of the Unite Here union that represents hospitality workers, disagrees. He said workers are impatient to return to work — for what is usually the lucrative summer season — but employers are the ones failing to adopt measures like frequent cleaning and wage subsidies. The union previously estimated that average wages in cities like Toronto are around $20 per hour for hospitality.

""A number of our members in the U.S. have gone to work and contracted (COVID-19),"" Robb said.

""There's just not enough safety in front of service. Nobody wants to stay home and make two grand when they can make double that by working.""

The survey suggested that the hospitality sector had the biggest share of employers, 45 per cent, who had trouble recalling workers. CFIB defines hospitality as including hotels, restaurants and bars.

The CFIB study suggests that in the hospitality sector, 56 per cent of hard-to-fill positions were ""unskilled, entry-level jobs"" that pay ""at or around minimum wage,"" although across sectors, skilled and semi-skilled jobs were harder to fill.

Employment and human rights lawyer Neena Gupta says she has heard of tradespeople unable to perform jobs because workers failed to return.

She said the reason an employee is refusing the work matters. Lack of childcare, like daycare and camps, can be a job-protected reason for staying home, as can disabilities such as being immunocompromised, says Gupta, a partner in Gowling WLG's Waterloo Region and Toronto offices.

The federal government's website states that workers seeking CERB, which offers $500 per week over a limited period, ""should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so."" The government's COVID-19 guidelines also provide for employees to refuse to do a dangerous job, although the worker must already ""be at work"" to refuse such a task.

However, notes Gupta, general apprehension about the pandemic is likely not enough to merit a job refusal. She said workplaces must comply with health and safety guidelines, and that a ministry inspection must find some sort of violation to justify a job refusal.

Managers should give workers a written ""come back to work"" recall and an indication that it will be treated as job abandonment if the worker doesn't return, says Gupta. After that process is completed, the employer could consider that worker terminated for cause, and hire a replacement.

While reporting misuse of CERB by a former employee might appear to give an employer some moral satisfaction, Gupta says it’s unlikely to help with staffing concerns or worker morale.

""I do ask people to be reasonable. You can’t call someone at noon on a Thursday and expect them in at 7 a.m. on Friday,"" she says.

CFIB, a policy advocacy group that represents small and medium-sized businesses and has 110,000 members, collected the data from members online between July 3 to July 6.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

It’s the hallmark of Kearney Funeral Services, one the family-owned and run business has been proud to provide families across Metro Vancouver with compassionate care for more than a century.

“We are one of the oldest businesses in Vancouver. We’ve been around for 112 years, and owned all that time by the same family,” says company CEO Ryan Crean who represents the fourth generation to work in the business started by his great grandparents.

“My great grandfather went to Dawson City during the gold rush, where he owned a general store. And when he came back to Vancouver with the money he made, he met my great grandmother who helped the local churches lay out those who had passed away,” Crean says. “They fell in love, purchased a funeral home, and the rest is history.”

Since that time, Kearney Funeral Services has always stood by the philosophy that theirs is the business of building relationships—with individual families and the community as a whole.

“Essentially, we try to always be there when people need us, regardless if it’s before they require our services, or at the actual time,” Crean explains.

That’s a rare quality in today’s funeral industry, which is populated mostly by large corporate operations.

“We strive to be involved with the communities where we do business, because that’s where we live, and those are the people we serve,” Crean says. “That’s why we place such importance on building those important relationships. It permeates everything we do.”

Whether it’s supporting the local Catholic Church community, and its charitable organizations and parishes, or service groups such as Rotary, Kearney Funeral Services takes pride in being a member the surrounding community can rely upon.

“Being a family business, we are looking after generations of families, as well,” Crean says. “And that has allowed us to have built up trust over time, which makes everything so much easier for our clients because they have a sense of familiarity and belief in what we do.”

That’s especially important in today’s longer-lived society where many families don’t experience the loss of a loved one until later in life. So, when they do, having a trusted and familiar contact to depend on, like Kearney Funeral Services, is a significant comfort.

“That’s why cultivating relationships is such an integral part of what we do,” Crean says.

“The best way to choose the perfect flooring for your home is to concentrate on 4 categories,” Melissa says.

Lifestyle: The way you live day-to-day should be a key factor in your decision. Heavier traffic needs strong flooring, such as ceramic tile, hardwood or vinyl. “You need to take into consideration if you have pets and how active in the home you are,” says Haqq. “Are they in a condo or townhome or house? Are they quiet or will they be entertaining people?” Location:“Many people go for a certain look without thinking about the consequences,” says Haqq. “They think hardwood flooring would look great in a bathroom or kitchen, for example. But the rule is, you really shouldn’t put hardwood in any area with moisture because it can buckle.” Other things to keep in mind is whether the flooring is in a high-traffic area, such as a foyer, or whether it needs to be cleaned regularly, such as in a mudroom. Cost: Let your flooring company know your budget, says Haqq. That will help you determine right away if you can afford hardwood or need to choose laminate- or if it’s going to be vinyl or carpet. And don’t forget the subfloor, “Depending on what you have underneath and whether it needs to have any improvements, the cost of your job could get very high,” says Haqq. “There’s a myth that you can just put a new floor over an old floor.” Sustainability: The interest in being “green” affects many people’s buying decisions. When applying it to flooring, you should keep in mind a variety of criteria for each product. Bamboo is considered sustainable because it regrows quickly; but it’s a soft wood and may need replacing sooner. Cork will also wear out quickly if the residents wear high heels. Metrotown Floors + Interiors has a variety of eco-friendly products that take all these factors into account.

If you’re in need of some extra help, a flooring expert from Metrotown Floors + Interiors can visit your home to do an in-home estimate.

For Tomlinson, that means sitting down with clients to look at goals, budgets and most importantly, cash flow, and not just figuring out the biggest possible amount a client can be approved for.

“Contrary to most mortgage application processes where the conversation begins by asking how much income is earned, at Custom Mortgages we begin the conversation by asking what type of property and location is desired, and depending on the given purchase price range for this type of product, we talk about what the individual cash flow needs are for each unique borrower, and from there provide them with their top three mortgage options and strategies to help them achieve their real estate purchase within the cash flow parameters we’ve identified.”

In other words: find success for each client by matching the right mortgage – type, conditions and size – to their actual lives, goals and financial situation.

For Tomlinson, avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach means getting to know her clients and their goals – and staying with them for the long-term.

She’s worked with countless clients through that overwhelming “first home purchase,” helping them navigate the process – but she’s also worked alongside long-time clients through multiple home sales and purchases.

“To be able to see someone achieve their goals is so rewarding,” she said. “I have heard many times: I didn’t think it would be possible, thank goodness I talked to you because having achieved this real estate ownership has made so much more in my life possible.”

For example, Tomlinson points to a client who, through several moves, went from not believing they could own a home at all, to being mortgage free.

“That’s a huge accomplishment and it’s very exciting to be part of people’s lives in that way,” she said.

As the organization reaches its 10th anniversary, they’re preparing to launch a unique app that will help people answer the question “What can I afford” which looks at not just the basics, like income level, but future plans like having children or moving to a different area.

“It’s not a simple question and the app will help make it simple by working step by step through all the factors,” she said. “It can be a very stressful process for people when it comes time to buy or sell, to apply for a new mortgage, and really at the end of the day my job is to make it straight-forward, to make it comfortable and to make it work for my client, now and into the future.”

""We're located on Thunderbird Street in Burnaby,"" Chef Shay Kelly of The Caterer and T-Bird Café explains. ""We just shortened the name to T-Bird. Our original idea was for all employees to wear leather jackets like those worn by the T-Birds gang in the move Grease, but that didn't pan out!""

In just 100 square feet, Kelly and his team manage to make more than 300 healthy salads, sandwiches, hot entrées, wraps and delicious desserts daily, seven days a week.

""We make about eight different sandwiches, a different hot entrée each day, and we make all our own desserts and granola,"" he says.

It's a labour of love for Kelly, who has travelled and worked internationally, but who has a passion for all things local.

""While I can't buy everything locally,"" he says, ""I give it a good try. Our meat and produce come from local farmers and we make just about everything fresh on the premises. Sure you can buy a Caesar salad dressing in a bottle that tastes not bad, but when we make it fresh that day with local ingredients. The taste is like night and day.""

Another passion for Kelly is the desire to teach kids how to cook.

""I want kids to know how to cook,"" he says simply. ""You know, their grandmother could cook, so could her mother, and so could her mother. But somewhere in my generation or the generation before, there was a skip. Kids aren't making cookies anymore. There's not that constant smell of cooking in a kitchen with three-year-olds anymore. It's a passion project. Yes, I want to make money to develop the bottom line, but it's all about the food and the kids for me.""

Kelly believes that money will come eventually, but his priority are kids and his employees.

""I want this to be a place where people come to work and it's just a cool place with an environment where they're constantly learning.""

Serving between 40 and 80 people per day, the T-Bird Café plans to expand its offerings to include take away meals for two, all made with fresh, local ingredients.

""We have to go local,"" Chef Kelly notes, ""I want to be at the forefront of that. And we're beginning to bark in a very loud voice about it.""

Yet it’s exactly what 23 year-old Kim did to get help with an addiction she worried would threaten the health of her unborn baby.

“Someone I dated led to me getting into a lot of trouble,” Kim says. “I’ve struggled with addiction and when I was in jail, I found out I’d taken fentanyl and it freaked me out. I was determined to get clean for my baby. So when I was told I could be released, I asked to stay in so I could get help through their methadone program.”

Kim’s request was granted and once clean, her social worker told her about EFry’s Ellendale Cradle program, which supports expectant and new mothers in maintaining their recovery, learning parenting skills and preparing for stable lives after a stay of up to three months.

“I’m so much better now,” says Kim, now mom to an infant daughter. “I feel safe and the staff is always around to help me. There’s no judgment, just support. It’s great for me and my baby.”

Child development monitoring and support is a unique element of the program.

“There is a significant focus on babies’ health and supporting mothers in learning what to expect with their development and helping them establish a strong parent-child bond,” says Justine Patterson, clinical director with the Elizabeth Fry Society (EFry).

Justine oversees both Ellendale Cradle and EFry’s other residential program for pregnant women and those with infants called Transitions to New Beginnings.

“Substance use and trauma are interconnected, so all our work is trauma-informed,” says Justine. “With the right support, people can build stable lives. Society needs to remove the stigma and encourage women to come forward and get help.""

While Ellendale Cradle provides recovering women with structured support and programming, Transitions to New Beginnings is a step down on the continuum of care, focusing on helping secure housing and regain independent living. Both programs only take clients who are seeking help in providing a stable, healthy home for themselves and their children.

Right from the start, he faced some complicated health problems, including being born with only three heart chambers instead of four. He survived his medical challenges into adulthood but passed away at the age of 25. His death devastated his mother, Marilyn.

“He was the first thing, the last thing, most of the things I ever thought of,” says the Port Coquitlam woman about her son. “I never thought about doing anything without first thinking of Greg.”

The grief was overwhelming, and Marilyn describes having regular panic attacks after Greg’s death. “We went to a barbecue once, and I actually stood in the middle of this backyard and screamed at the top of my voice,” she recalls.

Marilyn was referred to Royal Columbian Hospital psychiatrist Dr. Anson Koo, who eventually admitted her to hospital. “I was terrified,” says Marilyn. “But my husband took me and knew it was the best thing, because I wasn’t doing very well. I wasn’t coping at all.”

Marilyn spent five weeks at Royal Columbian Hospital, followed by 13-weeks in an outpatient program. “I met the most caring, the most compassionate people you could ever meet in your entire life,” recalls Marilyn. “I was also amazed at who else was in the hospital with me. How many young people, how many ordinary people, people that didn’t seem different. They were just struggling with life.”

Over time, Marilyn learned coping techniques that she says have helped her enormously. She continues to see Dr. Koo during follow-up visits.

“My life has changed completely since Gregory died,” she says. “I am 100% a different person. I just feel so fortunate that I was where I was at the right time in order to be able to get this long-term support.”

It is one of the toughest roadblocks to inclusion for children with disabilities. Kavita Kamat, the Clinical Director of Laurel Behaviour Support Services (LBSS), says that challenging behaviours often have a ripple effect that transcends far past the child. “It starts putting limitations on what they can do in the community,” Kamat explained, “causing their life to shrink further and further which really impacts the child and family’s quality of life.”

As a part of posAbilities, an agency that helps people with developmental disabilities lead meaningful and healthy lives, LBSS consultants see firsthand the impact of challenging behaviours on a child and his/her family. With several factors impacting and influencing the child’s challenging behaviours how does LBSS support the family in addressing the child’s needs?

article continues below

The answer, Kamat said, is to have a wrap around service surrounding the child and family.

“All of the professionals we work with,” whether it be speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, social workers, school teams, or psychiatrists, “bring in their subject expertise and the family brings in their child expertise to the team. This helps LBSS consultants work collaboratively to develop individualized behaviour support using evidence based strategies,” Kamat said. “In addition to decreasing challenging behaviours the plan always includes teaching new skills that the child needs, to communicate, and feel comfortable and safe in the environment,” Kamat added. These plans are then bolstered by resources, training, and other aids to troubleshoot barriers in the best interest of the child. Inclusion of children with disabilities and their families is something Kamat says is integral to helping children reach their full potential.

LBSS consultants work with culturally diverse families with a wide range of cultural values, beliefs, knowledge bases, and skillsets. LBSS has developed a strong foundation of cultural competence and it has helped consultants connect with families in ways that help optimize parental contribution and participation throughout the process. An evidence based, culturally sensitive, collaborative approach defines the work of LBSS with each family and team they support.

Another aspect Kamat said that is essential for inclusion is promoting support and understanding throughout the community for all individuals with disability. Encouraging empathy, patience, and the understanding that not everyone is the same can and will lead to more fulfilled lives for everyone.

Three of the club’s programs—Rotary Youth Leadership Awards(RYLA), Rotary Adventures in Citizenship, and Rotary Youth Exchange—are aimed at high school students across Burnaby.

article continues below

For the Rotary Youth Leadership Awards, schools submit their top Grade 11 and 12 students. Local Rotarians then interview the candidates and select one from each high school.

Participants are chosen based on their commitment to service and leadership potential, and are sent to a long weekend filled with intensive training.

“They make friends, are exposed to fantastic speakers, and come back super charged,” says longtime Rotarian, Vivian, of the program experience. “It’s really inspiring to see how enthusiastic these kids are. Some think they won’t fit in, but as soon as they get on the bus, they’ve already made friends and found their group.”

About 300 to 400 youth from across B.C. attend the camp, where they meet new people and enjoy a wealth of new and engaging experiences.

At RYLA, they learn how to be a leader, how to be proactive, and how to give others opportunities to develop. Speakers and business leaders run the workshops.

“RYLA was truly a unique and unforgettable experience that better equipped me for the challenges I will encounter in life,” writes Page, who attended RYLA this year. “Being surrounded by so many dedicated, positive, and supportive people was really encouraging.”

Those in Grade 12 also have the opportunity to apply for the Rotary Club’s Adventures in Citizenship program, through which two hundred youth from across Canada are sent to Ottawa where they learn about democracy and the privileges and responsibilities of Canadian citizenship.

Youth are chosen based on their interest in politics, academic records, leadership experiences, and volunteer service.

“It was the adventure of a lifetime,” writes Hamish who returned from the Adventures in Citizenship program in May. “I left for Ottawa with a hopeful attitude and an open mind, and returned with knowledge, experience, and friends that will last a lifetime.”

The Rotary Club of Burnaby Metrotown also offers a short-term and long-term exchange program for high school students to spend either three weeks or 11 months abroad. Previous countries have included France, Italy, and Germany.

“Our mission is to enhance athletic performance and spectator experience by providing high-quality products and installation services in the construction of sports facilities and entertainment venues,” explains owner Dave Wilson. “We provide our clients with an all-in-one, turn-key solution involving a comprehensive package of services.”

That includes helping customers in the planning, design and construction of a successful sport facility or entertainment venue project, for clients as diverse as major universities, school districts, municipal recreation facilities, and professional sports venues and performing arts theatres.

In all, Wilson says they’ve worked on thousands of facilities over their four decades and now have nearly 50 staff members nationally, including members of the management team, sales, project managers, and installation technicians. He’s proud of where they’ve come from, the growth they’ve already experienced, and says he’s excited to see what will come in the future.

“I came from the sporting goods business and I wanted to specialize in quality equipment products,” Wilson recalls. They began with specialized flooring products, bringing in unique and innovative products from Europe to the North American market for the first time. From there, they continued to add new and diverse products and services, growing with the needs of the industry and staying on top of new developments worldwide, an approach they plan to continue in the coming years. “There is some exciting new technology just around the corner in the sports and entertainment venue market,” he said. “New innovations in synthetic turf fields, advancements in LED video display technology and improvements in the performance of sports surfaces.” Through it all, the focus is always on the client, and ensuring that Centaur staff at all stages of a project have delivered both great customer service and the highest quality products.

“We have an unwavering commitment to improve the quality of sporting venues and facilities across Canada, to enhance the athlete and spectator experience and to help create a happier, healthier world by inspiring people to incorporate sports into their lives,” he said.

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The company also told the man that his credit is high risk, so he would need to pay $1,500 insurance for the lender, although the company would cover half. The company wanted the Vancouver man to send the money using Bitcoin.

The company, Kingsway Lending, according to the BBB, is using the address of a Canada Revenue Agency office in Ontario.

“Scammers understand that consumers are searching for websites that look professional, and will put effort into making your loan application process feel like the real deal,” said Laird.

“With this in mind, thorough research on a company before initiating any transactions, is the best way to avoid being tricked out of your money and personal information.”

What to look out for

The BBB says consumers should look out for the following red flags is they are searching for a lender or loan broker:

The health authority added the outbreak of C. difficile to its list of current outbreaks on July 14.

article continues below

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Rash

If you are visiting someone who is located on an outbreak unit, visitors may be limited to two people at a time.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

Perhaps a small wedding?

The City of Burnaby has announced that as part of its restart plan, residents can now book small meetings and events in a reduced capacity at popular facilities.

These facilities include the Shadbolt Centre for the Arts, Burnaby Art Gallery, Burnaby Village Museum and recreation centres. Packages are also available for micro-weddings, including an intimate ceremony and reception, at the Burnaby Mountain and Riverway clubhouses.

City staff have developed guidelines for each facility to ensure all bookings comply with physical distancing and provincial health requirements.

“Our community has worked hard to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19, which has allowed us to take another careful step forward in our restart plan,” said Mayor Mike Hurley. “We are pleased to offer Burnaby residents a safe option for their small-scale events and meetings at our facilities.”

In addition, dry floor space at arenas and a number of sports fields across Burnaby are now available to book. Sports organizations can book city facilities for training and skill development, although formal games for many sports are not yet permitted.

Safeguarding public health is the top priority for the City of Burnaby, said a news release, “each facility will comply with enhanced cleaning protocols and processes to ensure the well-being of our customers and staff.”",[]

The Burnaby Community Action Team (BCAT) on the Overdose Crisis penned a letter to council in late May with two calls to action for the city, including providing overdose response training and supplies to warming centre staff.

article continues below

“As illicit drug overdoses continue to rise, it is imperative that facilities supporting the homeless population in our city follow best practice measures,” reads the letter. “This means ensuring warming centre staff have access to overdose response supplies and basic training in relation to overdose recognition and response.”

The letter is cosigned by Michel Pouliot, executive director of Burnaby Family Life, and Dr. Lindsay McCaffrey with the Burnaby Division of Family Practices, along with several BCAT member organizations, including the Progressive Housing Society, Mosaic Burnaby Centre for Immigrants and the Burnaby Society to End Homelessness.

“In the event of an overdose, the wait time between a call to first responders and their arrival can cause permanent brain injury or death. Such experiences can be incredibly upsetting for witnesses and for staff,” reads the letter.

“Frontline workers who are not provided with the training and tools to respond often feel traumatized and powerless.”

The letter notes staff have taken sick leave in other jurisdictions as a result of that trauma, and some Burnaby warming centre staff are already taking naloxone to work.

In a report to council this week, staff said the city would need to “evaluate the operational implications of the request and would have to determine the advisability and feasibility of the request in order to evaluate whether or not this would be an effective additional measure to prevent overdoses in this context.”

Asked why the city would need to study the measure when naloxone training has been widely available for years, city spokesperson Chris Bryan said it is “standard for the city’s risk manager to review all procedures which may affect the health and safety of our patrons and staff, and which may result in liability exposure.”

The BCAT letter also called on the city to expand its resources for the homeless community in Burnaby during the pandemic, including keeping the warming centres, the last of which closed on July 1, open until an emergency shelter has been established in the city.

An emergency shelter is currently planned for the Burnaby Lake Sports Complex, and in the meantime, BC Housing has secured more hotel rooms to house local homeless individuals.

That Burnaby Lake emergency shelter, however, is only expected to be open until December, when construction of the Burnaby Lake complex replacement is set to begin.

“As the health of this population is already compromised, a COVID-19 outbreak would have a devastating impact,” reads the letter. “We know that the proposed locations for the ERC may serve as recreational sites when restrictions are lifted but the need to support vulnerable people and save lives must absolutely supersede residents’ access to such facilities.”

Staff also suggested the city work with community partners to develop short- and long-term actions to address homelessness.",[]

I applaud your decision to protect people, especially when you enter indoor public places. Unless, of course, you’re not wearing that mask properly.

I’ve seen too many people attempt to “wear” a face mask, but then ruin things by doing what the dude in the above photo is doing. (The photo kills me because it’s NBA player Daniel Theis from my beloved Boston Celtics, but what he’s doing is being done right here in Burnaby.)

Too many people are wearing their mask below their nose. Or their mask is only covering their nose and not all of their mouth. Or, in extreme cases, the person just says, f*%$ it, I’m going to just let it hang around my neck. I’ve seen at least two people have the mask loop just hanging off of one ear as they parade around a grocery store.

It’s like they think the mere approximation of the mask to their face – without actually covering the face – is enough to protect themselves and others.

It’s not, of course. I hate to get all preachy, but wearing the mask incorrectly is dangerous and embarrassing to you. People are literally laughing at you behind your back.

This is how you wear a mask. - ENGIN AKYURT PHOTO/UNSPLASH

Look, I get it. Wearing a mask is hot. I can’t wear my reading glasses and my mask at the same time because the glasses fog up. And so, I just move the phone or restaurant menu farther away from me so I can, well, sort of read it.

Compromises are necessary to ensure safety and stop the spread of COVID-19.

“Make sure your mask is well-fitted over your nose, mouth and chin, and that it is secured to your head with ties or ear loops so that you do not have to adjust frequently,” says Canada’s top public health official, Dr. Theresa Tam. “Try not to touch the mask or your face while wearing the mask, as this is another route of infection. Some people may not realize that masks can become contaminated on the outside. Wash your hands before and after putting on and taking off your mask using soap and water or a Health Canada-approved hand sanitizer. Only you should wear your mask - please do not share it with others.”

At a recent virtual town hall, representatives of several student groups said SFU’s plan to continue remote learning programs it implemented last spring at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic into the fall semester leaves their education wanting.

article continues below

“The quality is just not the same,” said Osob Mohamed, the president of the Simon Fraser Student Society.

She said students are missing out on the ability to talk with their professors and the quality of their school experience is often at the mercy of the robustness of their internet connection.

“It uncovers a lot of gaps in the system.”

But John Driver, SFU’s vice-president academic, said it’s incorrect to assume the move to new delivery methods affects the quality of education the school is able to provide. He said the university is actively providing coaching and resources to support instructors in their move to online teaching, as well as resources to assist students.

“The technological advances we’ve made in the past couple of decades means we can connect with each other better,” he said, adding online classes have been an option chosen voluntarily by about 10% of undergrad students for years as they’re better able to fit them around their busy schedules.

“We do have a lot of expertise and experience in remote learning.”

Orion Kidder, an adjunct professor at SFU and a representative for its Teaching Support Staff Union (TSSU), said remote learning has put an added burden on instructors and other staff.

“Teaching takes a lot more time, energy and effort when we’re doing it online,” he said, adding some of those frustrations filter down to technical support staff who are trying to keep up with the demand for quality cameras and microphones so the delivery of lectures is as good as possible.

The end result, said Matthew McDonald of SFU’s Graduate Students Society, is many students feel they’re getting less value for their tuition dollars, even as they face other financial burdens brought on by the pandemic, like a lack of summer or part-time employment opportunities.

“We’re really concerned about the financial impact of this pandemic,” he said.

Driver said the school is making some accommodations for those financial concerns, like extending the deadlines for paying tuition fees, allowing them to be paid in a payment plan over a period of time, as well as adjusting fees for things like lab supplies and access to the school’s recreation facilities if they’re not needed.

But, he added, the cost of delivering education remotely is no less than in a classroom.

“As time goes on, I anticipate people will become more comfortable with working in the remote or online environment,” Driver said. “The quality of learning will be the same as before.”",[]

For most businesses I know, it could not come soon enough and they were excited to welcome their customers, clients and colleagues back, and eager to do so safely.

There is one major employer in Burnaby, however, who has not been able to implement their plans, to reopen their doors and to restart their operations - and I’m concerned because of the outsized positive impact it usually has on our economy and community.

This employer is one of Burnaby’s largest, providing opportunities to over 1,100 residents in its Burnaby location to earn a living, contribute and support themselves and their families - not to mention the 7,100 others who work throughout its other locations.

This business serves as an important part of our tourism sector, helping position Burnaby as a dynamic urban centre with dining and entertainment options for locals and visitors alike.

They are also a major taxpayer, contributing nearly $900,000 in property taxes last year directly, and an additional $12.3 million in direct contributions to the city, which is used to pay for community projects, hold festivals, and fund community initiatives.

And this company also plays an important role in supporting the social services and charitable causes which many in our community rely on - especially in trying times such as these.

I know that last year it donated over $90,000 to local causes right here in our community, and through the provincial gaming grants program it contributed significantly to the $140 million in funding that went to non-profits and community organizations throughout the province in 2019.

If you’ve not guessed it by now, I’m of course referring to Burnaby’s Grand Villa Casino, which as I write this remains closed and outside of even the new Phase 3 re-opening plans.

I have been immensely impressed by the work of the provincial health officer during the pandemic, and applaud all involved for their thoughtful and cautious approach to the reopening of businesses and other facilities.

During all stages of that reopening, I have seen firsthand how seriously businesses of all types are taking the safety of their customers and staff.

I know the time, effort and expense being expended by local companies to develop their safety plans, purchase and install barriers, PPE, and signage, and provide the extra staff necessary to operate safely while protecting the public.

I am certain that Burnaby’s Grand Villa Casino would conduct itself with this same level of seriousness and attentiveness to safety when it is able to reopen, and I just hope they get the chance to do so soon.

Dr. Michael Schwandt, who was one of the first infectious disease specialists from Vancouver Coastal Health to help contain outbreaks at sites like the Lynn Valley Care Centre, made the comments not long after a group of 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, successfully appealing for the world health body to change its guidance on aerosolized transmission.

article continues below

“We'll be watching closely the science around airborne transmission. At this time, we don't think it's played a major role in the outbreaks in Vancouver Coastal Health that we've had direct experience with,” said Dr. Schwandt.

The new W.H.O. guidance, which came last Thursday, accepts that the novel coronavirus can spread through aerosolized particles — tiny droplets in the air — in crowded indoor settings for prolonged periods of time.

“There have been reported outbreaks of COVID-19 in some closed settings, such as restaurants, nightclubs, places of worship or places of work where people may be shouting, talking, or singing.

“In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission, particularly in these indoor locations where there are crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others, cannot be ruled out,” reads the W.H.O.’s new guidance, which also calls for more research into aerosol transmission. aerosol transmission.

But Dr. Schwandt said his team doesn’t view the airborne versus droplet transmission debate as a binary, and that while the virus can be traced at varying distances at concentrations, most of the cases he’s come across in Vancouver Coastal Health region, home to the first outbreaks in the country, have been from “face-to-face” transmission.

The proof, he said, comes from Vancouver Coastal’s success in tracing contacts based on direct contact, an experience a spokesperson for Fraser Health told the Tri-City News has been echoed in their health authority.

“Without taking airborne transmission into account as a risk factor, we've been able to bring outbreaks under good control, really looking at close physical contact as the main risk factor,” said Dr. Schwandt.

That means, at the moment, current ventilation systems in places like long-term care homes are not considered a risk factor in the spread of the virus.

Airborne or not, sharing air in large, indoor public gatherings raises everyone’s risk of transmitting the virus, as Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reminded British Columbians in her daily update Tuesday.

“Stay away from closed spaces as much as possible,” she said. “If it’s a house party, you may not know all the people who are there.”

And like the W.H.O., health officials in B.C. said they are keeping an eye on the science.

“If more evidence were to develop around airborne or aerosol transmission, then naturally we'd need to look at preventative measures that include attention to ventilation,” said Dr. Schwandt.",[]

He says the proposed measures mirror those adopted by the European Union, Britain and other jurisdictions.

""There are many other interests affected by the quarantine restrictions — not only jobs and pensions, but also the social and economic well-being of individuals and communities that rely on air travel, as well as basic freedoms of mobility,"" says Chung.

""Business and labour leaders alike have implored the government to act on easing these restrictions in order to strike a better balance, without adversely impacting public health.""

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The question is whether strong summer sales — driven in part by delayed purchasers waiting to buy since spring's lockdown — will carry forward to fall, experts said.

article continues below

The Canadian Real Estate Association on Wednesday reported that June sales were up 63 per cent on a month-over-month basis, and 15.2 per cent higher than the same time last year. Prices also rose from June 2019, up 6.5 per cent to an average $539,000.

""Home sales, prices and starts have effectively regained all the ground lost during the shutdown,"" BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a note to clients.

""However, fair point that some of this outsized strength is simply pent-up demand for the lost sales from the key spring season.""

The real estate industry came to a near standstill earlier this year as non-essential businesses closed to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. CREA said the jump in sales returned them to ""normal levels"" for June, noting they were up 150 per cent from where they were in April.

Porter said the housing market now must keep up its momentum headed into autumn. Though at a glance, the numbers appear to suggest nothing ""amiss in the economy whatsoever,"" the market will have to balance slowing immigration levels, low interest rates and short housing supply, he said in the note. This tension will come with lasting scars, he said.

Also on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada released its quarterly outlook, forecasting an uncertain economic recovery ahead, and suggesting housing activity will slow over the next few years.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said that the ""pent-up demand"" in the market has been boosted by first-time homebuyers looking for bargains during the downturn. That can crunch the number of new listings, since first-time owners don't have a home to sell, he said, noting CREA's data showed housing inventory at a 16-year low. The association said that the number of newly listed properties climbed 49.5 per cent from May to June.

If there are too many home buyers and too few listings available, that can drive up prices, said Soper. Soper predicts that more existing homeowners may list their homes in the fall, which may cause price increases to level off.

""We're seeing upward pressure on prices, and the highest levels of demand in Ontario and Quebec,"" said Soper. ""Things are good in other parts of the country, but they're quite calm, where the number of people looking for homes and the number of homes available for sale are roughly equal.""

Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, said in a client note that home prices are declining in Calgary, while elsewhere on the prairies, prices are either flat or rising.

Tim Otitoju, a Regina, Sask.-based real estate agent and chairperson of the province's real estate association, said that while the supply of homes for sale is steady and a bit low, sellers are getting more comfortable with the provincial measures to re-open business.

""We saw a surge in demand in June — we are actually attributing that to the buyers that held off during the shutdown,"" said Otitoju. ""It seems that buyers and sellers are showing a lot of confidence in the provincial reopening plan. Sellers are starting to put their houses back on the market.""

Soper said that he was reassured by the recovery in the West, given oil price volatility and regulatory changes in British Columbia. If immigration does slow, said Soper, it may be a few years before the long-term impacts surface, since homeownership for new Canadians spikes between three and seven years after arrival.

While home sales may be hitting ""normal levels,"" the overall housing market is ""obviously not back to normal at this point,"" said Shaun Cathcart, CREA's senior economist.

""The market has recovered much faster than many would have thought, but what happens later this year remains a big question mark,"" said Cathcart in a statement.

""That said, daily tracking suggests that July, at least, will be even stronger.""

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business surveyed more than 4,500 small business owners online from June 26 to July 2 and found that 2,100 respondents took on an average $135,000 in debt ($285.4 million for the responding group as a whole).

article continues below

Laura Jones, the executive vice-president of the organization that represents at least 110,000 small businesses, said debt has ballooned as 58 per cent of small businesses re-opened fully.

About 35 per cent are back to full staffing but only 24 per cent are back to normal revenue, she said.

""I've talked to many businesses that are open again, but are worried about being able to outrun the debt they have accumulated, particularly with sales still down,"" Jones said in a statement.

At the national level, that debt amounts to billions of dollars.

To finance COVID-19 revenue shortfalls and extra costs, the CFIB survey found 37 per cent of businesses are relying on personal savings, 34 per cent on credit cards, 18 per cent on bank loans, 11 per cent on retirement savings and 9 per cent each on mortgages and loans from families and friends.

Josie Rudderham, a co-owner of Cake and Loaf Bakery in Hamilton, Ont., wasn't surprised by the findings because her 12-year-old company was hit hard when COVID-19 began.

Cake and Loaf temporarily closed one location, permanently shut down a second and laid off workers right as the company's busiest season — Easter — hit. It emptied out what treats it had ready for sale and sent them home with employees or over to health care workers and food banks.

""A lot of expenses didn't stop, the overhead really didn't slow down that much, insurance itself is a big chunk of what we pay and that didn't get reduced. In fact, it went up,"" she said.

Rudderham, who has since reopened a location for curbside pickup, had to take out a loan to deal with cash flow issues and said many of her fellow small business owners did the same because they don't have the cash reserves larger companies do.

""I anticipate it will take us more than a decade to pay off some of this debt that we've had to take on because we are never aiming for profit,"" she said. ""We're aiming to break even every year and then every year we also increase wages because living wage gets recalculated every year.""

James McIntosh, the founder of Meaford, Ont.-based Duxbury Cider and chair of the Ontario Craft Cider Association, also stumbled on troubles when bars and restaurants were forced to close in March.

Duxbury's sales dropped 53 per cent, but McIntosh still considered himself fortunate because his family operates the farm and only has a few workers on staff.

He took out a loan and later, when patios reopened saw about a fifth of his licensed business came back.

Others borrowed money and didn't have such luck. They could be trying to cover what they lost for far longer, he said.

""Some of the smaller guys were really hurt because they didn't have an LCBO or grocery store (selling arrangement),"" he said. ""They were basically relying on what business they could drum up locally with bars and restaurants.""

According to the polling industry's generally accepted standards, online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error because they do not randomly sample the population.

“The decision about criminal jury trials is entirely in the hands of the chief justice of the Supreme Court and the judiciary,” David Eby said. “On our end, the sheriffs and court services branch are working very closely with the judiciary to support the courts in getting jury trials up and running as soon as we can.”

article continues below

The court is expected to make an announcement on criminal jury trials this week.

The pandemic has created a significant backlog in court cases, Eby said. Four thousand cases were adjourned when in-person hearings were restricted in B.C. Supreme Court. The provincial court has adjourned more than 10,000 cases, including traffic tickets, family matters, minor prosecutions and small claims.

To help deal with the backlog, Eby has proposed a one-year restriction on civil jury trials.

But people accused of a criminal offence have a constitutional right to a jury trial. It’s considered the key to a fair and just system. To choose a jury, whether civil or criminal, requires the assembling of a significant number of people, Eby said.

“Potential solutions include larger venues for jury selection and doing tiered selection, where you bring in one group of people, and then another group of people, as opposed to typically bringing in around 200 people and selecting from the pool,” he said.

The order of the provincial health officer limiting all public gatherings to 50 people makes it a challenge, he said.

At the Victoria courthouse, defence lawyers have been setting criminal jury trial dates for the fall, even though they believe it’s unlikely their trials will go ahead.

Criminal defence lawyer Jordan Watt said it’s difficult to conceptualize getting 12 people together, approximately one foot apart from each other, to listen to the evidence throughout a trial which could last one week or up to three or four months.

“Then to get them to deliberate together without there being some type of massive construction to the current courtroom setup that we have right now, it’s just not going to happen,” Watt said.

“Even if you go a step further, I think you’re going to have problems getting people to come to court in order to be selected as jurors.”

All the provinces are struggling with the issue, said Eby, who is part of a national committee co-chaired by Chief Justice Richard Wagner and federal Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti.

The committee offers national guidance to chief justices, judges and court administration officials on the gradual resumption of court operations across Canada. The action committee is dealing with the challenges of jury trials and hearings in small court rooms, circuit and remote courts. It has released a document around best practices for jury trials and how to try and conduct jury trials in the COVID-19 era.

Eby has repeatedly asked Lametti to give increased discretion to judges under the Criminal Code around jury trials to address the realities of COVID-19.

“He’s indicated that he’s willing to look at those things, but the earliest they could be in the legislature is in the fall, so we’ve got quite a period of time before that happens,” Eby said.

The provincial attorneys general have also been asking the federal government for guidance on the timelines of the Jordan decision during COVID-19, Eby said.

In July 2016, in R. v. Jordan, the Supreme Court of Canada created new limits of 18 months from the time a charge is laid until the trial is completed in provincial courts and 30 months in superior court. Anything longer violates the accused’s right to be tried within a reasonable time, unless the prosecution can show exceptional circumstances.

“It’s clear that in exceptional circumstances you can go beyond the Jordan timelines,” Eby said. “The question for everybody is how long is the exceptional circumstance in relation to COVID.”

He hopes the federal government can give the provinces a legislated COVID-19 period that is deemed to be an exceptional circumstance “so we don’t end up with different exceptional circumstances across Canada and different standards of access to justice for the accused.”

Eby is calling for mandatory arbitration of ICBC claims to deal with the backlog.

“There were already a significant number of people waiting a long period of time for their trials,” he said. “Now we’re looking at allowing plaintiffs to require ICBC to enter into a binding arbitration process so they can have their matter heard sooner and relieve pressure on the court.”

Another strategy would allow people to appear virtually in both traffic and family matters. This would free the court from restrictions on how many courtrooms and how much spacing is needed, he said.",[]

That’s been the automatic response in most of the world. It’s undeniably effective, and an overwhelmingly popular approach. So Finance Minister Carole James committed Tuesday to carrying on. But her fiscal update vividly illustrated what the government is up against.

article continues below

Her February budget was balanced, with a few hundred million in reserve.

The new estimate is a deficit this year of $12.5 billion, the biggest ever, and one that developed almost instantly.

That’s not a forecast. The situation is so wildly unpredictable they’ve give up doing forecasts. They’re just “scenarios” now. So it could go higher.

As James said: “That's why we've developed a scenario, rather than a typical forecast, because of the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the economic decline caused by the pandemic.”

She’s acknowledged there will be deficits for at least the next three years. But it’s more likely to be a decade or more.

(Two years ago officials marked the elimination of just one component of B.C.’s debt, the operating debt stemming mostly from accumulated deficits. It took 40 years to accomplish that.)

The federal government did a similar update last week. Its projected deficit of $34 billion has jumped to $343 billion because of the pandemic.

So the on-going federal-provincial plan to keep helping people is based on borrowing more and more money to pay for it.

Rock-bottom interest rates will ease some concern about the hole they’re digging.

And there are projections that the economic collapse will only last for a year. So an optimistic outlook would be a one-year catastrophe followed by a bounce back in 2021, followed by years of whittling deficits back down to size.

Government finances obviously depend entirely on the private sector economy. James’ briefing included an exhaustive list of crises in different sectors.

Roughly half the new deficit is the new spending to help people cope ($5 billion in direct aid, $1.3 billion in deferred taxes and extensions). The other half arises from a collapse in government revenues.

There is a billion less in personal income tax, another billion less in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion less in sales tax, as examples. That’s all due to retail sales dropping 24 per cent, home sales down 45 per cent, 235,000 fewer jobs, corporate profits down 36 per cent and a seven to eight per cent drop in the provincial GDP, all in the last five months.

“No one has a playbook for dealing with this,” James said. So the plan they’ve fashioned is based on the fervent hope this is a one-year nightmare.

She has plans to announce a “recovery plan framework” in September, which would outline the expectations for how $1.5 billion in stimulus spending might be used.

But all the “scenarios” depend on the COVID-19 daily counts. Any sustained increases or outbreaks could delay recovery plans. That would make economic calamity even grimmer and more protracted than it already is.

Whatever the virus does in the next while, COVID-19 will be around for years as an economic factor.

Just So You Know: James spent 60 minutes detailing the extent of the economic catastrophe. She ran through 24 slides showing devastating impacts on every single aspect of the economy.

But the official news release covering her update was a study in deliriously-upbeat positivity. It was headed: “B.C.’s strong fiscal response, economic foundation support people.”

It rehashed all the previous good news announcements, ignored all the alarms and buried the stunning news there “could be” a $12.5 billion deficit.

It’s probably a firing offence for communications staff to write anything that leaves a negative impression in these sorts of releases.

But in a world where governments are spending more than ever, getting their own news out and covering themselves on all platforms as they see fit, the release is a reminder: It’s good to get an independent view.

Amendments to the Workers Compensation Act would increase the maximum insurable earnings to $100,000 from $87,100.

article continues below

The government says it is aiming for at least 90 per cent of workers to have 100 per cent of their earnings covered if they are can't work because of an injury suffered on the job.

The bill would also allow the safety agency to obtain search and seizure warrants when it investigates workplace safety infractions, if authorized by a court.

As well, it would allow victim impact statements to be heard in court in serious workplace prosecutions.

Labour Minister Harry Bains said the changes will help injured workers and their families, while also giving WorkSafeBC more tools to investigate workplace incidents.

""This bill makes modest but important improvements to several aspects of British Columbia's workers compensation system,"" Bains told the legislature.

The legislation would strengthen the way occupational diseases caused by viral pathogens are handled by fast-tracking the presumption for when a virus was contracted on the job, if established by WorkSafeBC's board of directors.

The government says this would mean people who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 at work are able to get benefits more quickly.

It would also expedite health care for a worker before a claim is accepted in cases when treatment would likely prevent a significant deterioration in health.

The government says in a statement that the legislation would allow WorkSafeBC to adjust a one-year time limit on mental health claims because it ""is not realistic for most workers, given the delay or gradual onset of some mental disorders.""

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act were developed after three expert reviews, which included consultations with employer, labour and Indigenous organizations.

The government says it also considered systems that are in place elsewhere in Canada and took into account the possible effects of the changes on employer premium rates.

More than 100,000 new claims are made in B.C. every year due to workplace injuries or fatalities, the government says.

There were 140 workplace fatalities last year, with 84 of them caused by occupational disease, 40 by traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

The province says WorkSafeBC conducted 141 investigations in 2019.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

According to the survey released on Tuesday, 19.3 per cent of businesses could operate at their current level of sales and spending for less than six months but would have to take additional action if it lasts for a longer duration. Nearly 35 per cent of hotels and restaurants only have the runway for six more months of lockdown measures, says the survey conducted May 29 to July 3.

The results come as many businesses are looking at government programs or credit to remain afloat.

Almost 64 per cent of survey respondents said they were approved for outside credit or government funding programs such as Canada Emergency Business Account loans or wage subsidies. Less than 24 per cent of businesses said in the survey that their rent or mortgage payments were deferred during the pandemic.

While working from home has increased during the pandemic, only about a quarter of survey respondents indicated they would likely offer teleworking as an option going forward after COVID-19 spread is contained.

The version released on Tuesday was a follow-up to a crowd-sourced questionnaire on the Statistics Canada website, a collaboration launched in April, with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, that surveyed 12,600 businesses. The sample was not designed to reflect the overall Canadian economy.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to ""discretionary"" travel like vacations and shopping trips since the pandemic took hold of the continent in mid-March, a rolling 30-day agreement that's currently set to expire July 21.

article continues below

Officials on both sides of the border who are familiar with the ongoing talks, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public, say another extension until late August is all but inevitable, thanks to a towering wave of new COVID-19 cases that's swamping efforts to restore a modicum of normality in the U.S.

New York Rep. Brian Higgins, one of several members of Congress from northern states keen to see a plan for reopening the border, expressed dismay Tuesday at news he called disappointing but hardly surprising.

""With no leadership from President Trump to address the pandemic, cases in the United States are spiking and as a result U.S. citizens are not welcome in several countries around the globe, including many of our allies,"" Higgins, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Recent calls from Higgins and others for a plan to start easing border restrictions have been greeted with social-media scorn and derision in Canada, where recent polls make clear the idea of allowing entry to Americans any time soon is a non-starter.

The novel coronavirus has been particularly resurgent in southern states like Florida, Texas, Georgia and Louisiana, where businesses tried to reopen early, contrary to the advice of public health officials, and the wearing of face masks became a partisan issue.

""The U.S. and Canada should be developing a plan that lays out what continued, nuanced management of the border during a prolonged pandemic will look like,"" Higgins said.

""But the administration's failure to develop a national plan for widespread testing, (personal protective equipment) distribution and the rejection of social distancing and mask-wearing to slow the spread doesn't inspire confidence that such a plan is in the works.""

Wearing a mask, perhaps the simplest way to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, has evolved into one of the most complex and flummoxing points of division in the U.S., thanks in part to conflicting signals early in the crisis about its effectiveness and the obvious reluctance of the commander-in-chief to embrace the idea.

It was only just this past weekend — nearly four months into the crisis — that Trump himself was photographed wearing one in public, during a visit with wounded service members at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urged Americans to mask up Monday, saying facial coverings for everyone in the country would break the pandemic's back in less than two months.

""It's our major defence to prevent ourselves from getting this infection,"" Redfield told a news conference in Charlotte, N.C. ""If all of us would put on a face covering now for the next four weeks, six weeks, I think we could drive this epidemic into the ground.""

Paradoxically, new online polling from Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies suggests the idea of mandatory masking in public is more popular in the U.S. than it is in Canada.

Leger's latest online poll, conducted July 10 to 12, found 72 per cent of 1,001 American respondents supported the idea of mandatory masks indoors, compared with 67 per cent of the survey's 1,523 Canadian participants. Of those surveyed in the U.S., 41 per cent said they would consider it a violation of their personal freedoms, compared with 27 per cent of those in Canada.

""Americans are far more likely to agree that rights are at issue,"" said ACS president Jack Jedwab. ""Yet, despite the fact that Americans strongly agree that the mask requirement is a rights infringement, they nonetheless believe that mask wearing should be mandatory.""

Trump appears to be capitulating on other border issues as well: on Tuesday, facing a lawsuit from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the administration abandoned a controversial measure that would have forced international students whose courses move entirely online to either transfer schools or leave the country.

That news likely comes as a relief to untold thousands of Canadian students studying south of the border, many of whom have been forced into virtual classrooms with colleges and universities having cancelled in-person classes.

Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, was reluctant Tuesday to discuss the worsening COVID-19 situation in the U.S. in any detail.

But he said cross-border travel in a public health emergency is usually a matter of ensuring that both countries have a similar grip on the circumstances, taking into account factors like their respective health-care systems, testing and contact-tracing regimes and strategies for preventing transmission.

Given that a number of U.S. states are experiencing community transmission of COVID-19 and don't have the situation under control, it will likely be weeks or even months before the benefits of additional preventative steps become apparent.

""It will take some time,"" Njoo said. ""If I were to travel anywhere, I would stick to Canada for the time being.""

Bruce Clark, president and CEO of the biopharmaceutical company Medicago, cautions observers against holding unrealistic assumptions that his product — or any of the numerous vaccine hopefuls in development globally — can bring the pandemic to a screeching halt if proven viable.

article continues below

Clark notes more than 120 companies are trying to come up with a COVID-19 vaccine, many of which have never been in the vaccine space before.

He doesn't doubt that ""something's going to come out of this,"" but he questions how effective it may be.

""Whatever vaccine we get in this first round — unless it's a miracle — it's not going to be perfect,"" says Clark, whose company began trials for its proposed vaccine Monday in Quebec City.

""It's going to have to undergo development, it's going to take probably years to come up with an understanding of the right vaccine, the right approach. It's not the panacea.

""To assume that we can have, in 18 months, the solution to a pandemic that comes around once in a generation, is naive.""

Canada's deputy public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo expressed similar cautions Tuesday, while acknowledging the need to develop viable vaccines and therapies.

""Lots of different steps are still ahead of us before we might even anticipate that there might be a safe, effective vaccine that would be available for use in the general population,"" said Njoo.

So much is still unknown about COVID-19, notes Clark, including how it may manifest during the flu season later this year.

He suspects a more likely scenario is that a vaccine will offer only part of the solution, along with new therapeutics and ongoing public health interventions.

Medicago's first phase of clinical trials will test the safety of a plant-based product on 180 healthy men and women, aged 18 to 55.

The randomized, partially blinded study uses technology that does not involve animal products or live viruses like traditional methods.

Clark notes that vaccine developers typically use chicken eggs to propagate a virus, but Medicago uses recombinant technology involving the genetic sequence of a virus, with living plants as the host.

The resulting virus-like particles mimic the shape and dimensions of a virus, which allows the body to recognize them and spark an immune response.

Clark says the plant-based approach is significantly faster and offers more consistent results than egg-based or cell-based methods.

It's the same method Medicago has used for a proposed seasonal flu vaccine that Clark says is currently being reviewed by Health Canada. If approved, Clark says it would be the first plant-based vaccine in the world.

While it takes five to six months to propagate a virus in eggs, the plant-based technique requires just five to six weeks, he says.

""In a pandemic, something like COVID, if you're able to cut that much time off development, you have a substantial impact on public health.""

Meanwhile, Clark says viruses are prone to mutations as they adapt and grow in an egg, which could result in a vaccine that doesn't exactly match the circulating virus. In contrast, ""a plant is a plant,"" and that makes production easily scalable.

""One plant behaves like 100,000 plants,"" he says.

The trial will evaluate three different dosages alone, or with one of two adjuvants provided by GlaxoSmithKline and Dynavax. An adjuvant can boost the effectiveness of a vaccine for a better immunological response, thereby reducing the required dose, Clark adds.

He hopes to know the safety of the product, as well as effectiveness of the adjuvants and dosing by October. Based on that, researchers would kick off a second, more targeted trial phase involving about 1,000 participants.

If that's successful, Clark says a third phase would involve about 15,000 to 20,000 subjects, include older cohorts, and may be a global study, depending on circumstances of the pandemic by then.

If the vaccine proves effective, Clark points to another uncertainty.

Because the company's commercial plant is across the border in Durham, N.C., he says there's no guarantee of a Canadian supply.

""'Guarantee' is a strong word,"" says Clark. ""Strange things happen to borders in the context of a pandemic.""

Such border complications were made clear to Canadians in April when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau complained about problems with incomplete or non-existent deliveries of critical COVID-19 supplies. At the time, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered U.S. producers to prioritize the domestic market.

Clark suggests similar hurdles could impact vaccine distribution, putting immediate pressure on Medicago to complete construction of a large-scale manufacturing facility in its home base of Quebec City.

""Certainly, we need a facility in Canada,"" Clark says.

""There's no guarantee on the easy flow of materials back and forth across the border should we have a successful vaccine. We have to keep the focus on completing the Canadian facility so that we have domestic capacity. I think this is what most countries are concerned about.""

By the end of 2023, the Quebec City plant is expected to be able to produce up to one billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccine annually.

Until then, Medicago says it expects to be able to make approximately 100 million doses by the end of 2021, assuming its trials are successful.

Clark says countries must temper any nationalist agendas that might emerge with a viable vaccine and acknowledge that the fight against COVID-19 is global.

Meeting that demand would require multiple manufacturers, multiple distribution routes, and lots of co-operation, he says, possibly through the World Health Organization.

""There has to be some ability to share those around and distribute, whether that's through an entity like the WHO, or something equivalent.""

The Liberals last week revealed this year's projected deficit sits at $343 billion, driven by an estimated $231.9 billion in COVID-19 spending, so far, and a massive drop in government revenue.

article continues below

With the deficit at levels not seen since the Second World War, Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies asked 1,523 Canadians whether they felt the government ought to immediately and quickly begin to scale back pandemic support programs to Canadians and to business.

Forty-one per cent said yes to that question, 44 per cent said no and 15 per cent said they didn't know or preferred not to answer.

The survey was conducted between July 10 and 12, just after the Liberals released their projections.

It cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

This week, the Liberal government announced that one of the biggest benefit programs — a federal wage subsidy — will be extended until the end of this year.

It covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits that have lost at least 30 per cent of their revenues.

""Over the last three months you have seen me come out to talk with Canadians about what we're doing to help you and your family, your employer, your local businesses deal with this pandemic,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday in announcing the extension.

""We're going to continue to do that vital work.""

As of July 6, the wage subsidy had paid out $18.01 billion to 252,370 companies. Last week's fiscal and economic update from the Liberals increased the overall budget to $82.3 billion.

The other marquee support program, the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, is set to expire in the fall.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

Of those surveyed, 78 per cent said they were worried about the size of the deficit and how it may affect things in Canada in the long term.

In releasing the deficit projections, the Liberals didn't set out a plan for how or when they might get the books back to balance.

The survey asked respondents which of two routes traditionally use to cut deficits they would support.

In the survey, 60 per cent said the government ought to focus on cutting government spending, while 21 per cent said the focus should be on raising taxes.

Finance Minister Carole James said the numbers are staggering with job losses of 235,000 since February and a predicted GDP decline of 6.8 per cent by the end of this year.

article continues below

“We were preparing for economic moderation, we were well-equipped to be able to weather the challenges,” James said at a news conference Tuesday.

“What came next was unprecedented. Mere weeks after Budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed.”

The government has provided $6.26 billion in financial aid to businesses and individuals. Among the losses it anticipates this fiscal year because of the pandemic are close to $1 billion in personal income tax, $973 million in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax, James said.

The projected GDP decline in 2020 would be the worst on record going back to the 1980s, although it is also projected to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2021.

James said for context, B.C.’s real GDP has only declined twice in the past 40 years, falling by 2.4 per cent in 2009 and 6.4 per cent in 1982.

“As those numbers remind us, this could be the worst downturn experienced in our province recent history,” she said.

B.C.’s restart plan is showing signs of hope for the economy as consumer confidence increases, she said. The unemployment rate is slowly rebounding and fewer wildfires and floods have helped the bottom line.

However, she warned that the province’s financial forecast could change depending on many risk factors, including the possibility of a second wave of infections, the possibility of a vaccine, as well as the success of relief measures and central bank policy.

Regardless of how B.C. copes with the pandemic, James said its economy is also subject to the economic health of other jurisdictions, particularly those that buy from the province.

James said it wouldn’t help the economic recovery to pull back on spending, but the government will review every cent spent as it heads into the next budget year.

The B.C. government has tabled legislation giving itself room for three years of deficits, which James said will be re-examined each year.

James said she believes people care about provincial deficits because they understand it’s taxpayer money, but they also understand the emergency the pandemic created.

She declined to predict how long the recovery would take, given the many moving pieces at play.

“There is no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the economy of British Columbia and that’s not short term,” she said.

The job losses have been widespread but some have been disproportionately affected, depending on a worker’s age, gender or which sector they work in, James said.

Young workers are among the hardest hit, with the unemployment rate rising sharply from 9.1 per cent in February to 29.1 per cent in June for those aged 15 to 24.

Women, who dominate the service industries and many of whom have also left jobs to care for family members, are another group more affected. Their unemployment rate rose from 4.8 per cent in February to 13.4 per cent in June.

The hardest hit industries include wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services, construction, culture and recreation.

The overall unemployment rate of 13 per cent remains at its highest level since 1987. While the job losses in March and April were record breaking, the figures for May and June have seen modest recovery as the economy started to reopen.

“The projected numbers are staggering but they’re not without hope. Things are getting better each and every day when we follow the provincial health officer’s advice,” James said.

The NDP government’s fiscal update was met with calls for an economic recovery plan by its political opponents, with the Opposition B.C. Liberals asking what happens when federal benefits like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit run out.

Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson also suggested the government should reconsider its pre-pandemic spending priorities.

“People in every corner of B.C. have had to adjust to a new normal and adapt their household budgets, so why is this government pretending it’s business as usual?” he asked in a statement.

The Green party said the province should transition to a green economy by helping traditional industries become more sustainable, spending on training and building local businesses into the supply chain.

“We can seize the once in a generation opportunity to strategically drive stimulus spending towards a future British Columbians want: an innovative, low-carbon, sustainable, just and inclusive economy for all,” interim leader Adam Olsen said.

In a numbers experiment to better reflect pandemic spending, Statistics Canada found the annualized inflation figures for April and May would have been 0.0 and -0.1 per cent.

The research paper made public Monday says a specific consumption pattern, such as that happening during the pandemic, would need ""to be sustained in order to have a subsequent impact"" on year-over-year headline numbers.

The research was aided by data from the Bank of Canada, which targets an annual inflation rate of two per cent as measured by Statistics Canada's consumer price index.

The bank has warned that the economic shock wrought by COVID-19 and structurally low interest rates is having a deep effect on the inflation rate, which is far below the target.

The basket of goods used to form the consumer price index has been shaken by a shift in consumer spending habits during the pandemic.

People are buying less gasoline, which usually receives a heavier weight in calculating inflation, as its price has plunged and the frequency of car travel has dropped. Canadians are travelling much less, while grocery-buying is up.

Statistics Canada is to report June's inflation rate next week.

The Bank of Canada said in April that it expected inflation to be close to zero in the second quarter.

Beyond the end of June, the bank was less clear, citing the high level of uncertainty around the course of the pandemic.

The federal government's economic ""snapshot"" last week pegged inflation at 0.5 per cent for this year, then rising back to two per cent in 2021.

The reading was based on the average of forecasts from 13 private sector economists.

On Wednesday, the central bank will release its updated outlook. Governor Tiff Macklem has described what's coming as a ""central planning scenario"" for the economy and inflation, as well as related risks — such as local, but not national, lockdowns.

Indigenous communities closed during pandemic but at economic cost,['Nick Wells'],,"Indigenous bands along the west coast of British Columbia say their borders will remain closed to tourists and non-residents, despite the economic impact, as they work to raise awareness about the threat COVID-19 poses to their communities.

The Nuu-chah-nulth, the Heiltsuk Nation and the Haida Nation have all closed or restricted access to their territories and reserves.

""Of course it's negatively impacting. But our directors have said, our chiefs have said, people before economics,"" said Judith Sayers, the president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, in an interview. ""I think everyone is slowly realizing the impact economically, but right now we just really feel that we want to protect the members first.""

Members of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, made up of 14 First Nations along the west coast of Vancouver Island, have deployed a variety of tactics to help ensure their borders are kept sealed from non-residents.

Members of the Ahousaht First Nation, who live in the remote area of Flores Island, have deputized citizens to act as peacekeeping officers, Sayers said.

The Ahousaht issued a notice on July 2 that their territory, which covers a large area of land and water north of Tofino, including provincial parks, will remain closed to tourists and non-residents as there ""is still no vaccine, no anti-serum and no cure for COVID-19.""

Others, like the Tla-o-qui-aht in Tofino, had been stopping cars in an effort to convince them to turn around.

While Tofino is now welcoming back visitors, the Tla-o-qui-aht communities of Ty-Histanis, Esowista and Opitsaht remain closed to those who haven't been invited. The closure includes part of Long Beach in Pacific Rim National Park.

The concern, Sayers says, lies in the ability to test and contain any potential COVID-19 outbreak.

""A lot of our communities are remote and testing is not easily available,"" she said. ""If you're in Port Alberni, or Nanaimo, or Victoria, or somewhere (else), you can get testing and get results in 24 hours. It's not the same with our communities.""

The closures have resulted in disputes between Indigenous groups and local businesses.

The Haida Nation in Haida Gwaii have turned away non-residents at the ferry terminal, discouraged leisure travel and called on two local fishing lodges to rethink their reopening plans.

""We're such a close-knit community, I think that once we get a case of COVID, I think that it'll spread like wildfire,"" said Duffy Edgars, the chief councillor of the Old Massett Village council in Haida Gwaii.

Edgars said many local fishing lodges are respecting the Haida Nation's state of emergency, but is frustrated by others who want to open up.

""It's disrespectful,"" he said. ""These bigger (lodges) are coming in and just doing whatever they want.""

The fishing lodges that have opened say visitors and staff will not have contact with the Haida Gwaii communities, and they have emergence evacuation plans in place if a COVID-19 case were to develop.

Leaders and representatives from the Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk and Haida all say they would like to see more co-operation from the provincial government in working with Indigenous communities.

""It's really frustrating,"" said Marilyn Slett, the chief councillor of the Heiltsuk. ""We have a limited amount of time here, we think, before that anticipated second or third wave so right now is the time for us to be sitting down and having those discussions so going forward we're all working collaboratively together.""

Part of the issue, she says, lies in B.C. politicians encouraging residents to take part in inter-provincial tourism.

""We're seeing a lot more vessel traffic on the coast, we're seeing a lot more recreational boaters, and that's a really high concern for our community,"" said Slett.

The closures — many of which began in March — have been felt at a variety of levels.

The pandemic forced the cancellation of the Heiltsuk's Spawn-on-Kelp fishery this year, an event Slett says employs 700 people and is a hugely important economic driver for the community.

""Certainly our community put forward the health and safety before the economic driver,"" she said. ""So our community has been hit hard.""

Sayers says when the pandemic first broke out and restrictions were placed on communities, First Nations were bringing in food for members so they didn't have to leave their reserves and face possible exposure at grocery stores.

The Heiltsuk, Nuu-chah-Nulth and the Tsilhqot'in issued a statement in late June, criticizing the provincial government's reopening plan and what they saw as a lack of dialogue with First Nations groups.

All three want the province to commit to four conditions, which would allow border restrictions being lifted: COVID-19 information sharing, screening, rapid testing and culturally safe contact tracing teams.

Until those are met, Slett says, she can't see Indigenous communities fully opening their borders.

But the provincial government says it is committed to working with Indigenous communities.

""Many tourist-depending communities are now safely welcoming the gradual return of out-of-town visitors,"" said Sarah Plank, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. ""At the same time, we acknowledge some smaller and more remote communities and First Nations continue to be concerned about visitors to their communities.""

The government is also working on scheduling a meeting with the Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsilquot'in, Heiltsuk and Haida Nations and other communities, she added.

Why it matters: The program brings cost relief to businesses hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and is intended to support employment.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Monday for not recusing himself from discussions about the administration of Ottawa's $900 million student volunteer program.

WE Charity was initially selected to deliver the initiative under a nearly $20 million contract. Trudeau said he was aware of his family's ties to the organization, but unaware of the honorariums his mother and brother received for their involvement.

""It is not a surprise to me that they got paid by WE, but I did not know that they got paid by WE,"" Trudeau said.

""In this situation, I should have recused myself,"" he added, acknowledging that his involvement in Ottawa's student volunteer program has created controversy. Members of the Conservative Party of Canada have called on Trudeau to address his involvement before Ottawa's ethics committee.

""I get that. I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussion.""

Trudeau said he will evaluate any requests to address the issue before parliament. He also said that, because of his involvement, the rollout of the student volunteer program has been a bit delayed – an outcome he deeply regrets.

In addition to addressing the issue, Trudeau said on Monday that the federal government will extend its wage subsidy program until the end of the year. More information on the extension is expected this week.

The prime minister also said he spoke with U.S. president Donald Trump earlier in the day about the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement – which took effect July 1, – Black Lives Matter, China, the two Canadians who remain detained in China and U.S. aluminum tariffs.

""I highlighted to the president that the pandemic has disrupted usual manufacturing processes and supply chains,"" said Trudeau. ""It would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time when we're celebrating the new NAFTA.""

Trudeau briefly told reporters to expect a joint announcement regarding the closure of the Canada-U.S. border.

Non-essential travel across the border is banned until late July.

But the government is being warned it may have to move the end date into 2021.

The program is the heart of the Liberals' promise to help Canadians get back to work, even if has to be at a slower pace, as the pandemic wanes.

Speaking outside his Ottawa residence, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the extension to give ""greater certainty and support to businesses as we restart the economy.""

Trudeau didn't say how the government will reshape the eligibility rules for the program that critics have said stop some employers from getting aid they need.

He promised more details in the coming days.

While some companies are back open with restrictions easing, other parts of the economy are still reeling from the effects of COVID-19.

Some sectors will only start up in the fall or even the winter and will need help into next year, said Ross Laver, senior vice-president for strategy at the Business Council of Canada. He pointed to airlines as one example where rehiring may be slow.

""I don't think anybody expects that those industries that have been really hard-hit, that everything is going to be fine by Dec. 31,"" he said.

""We need to bear in mind that some of them are going to need help for an extended period of time.""

The wage subsidy previously was to expire the first week of June but the Liberals announced an extension to the end of August in mid-May.

The government has yet to share eligibility requirements for July.

Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said the extension would be welcomed by many small companies that have seen costs return faster than revenues.

He also pressed the need for eligibility rules to understand how to qualify.

""Not a single employer in Canada understands whether they qualify for the July wage subsidy and we're in mid-July. So they need to do an awful lot better,"" Kelly said.

""It sounds great to have an announcement to extend the subsidy, but businesses in order to use it really need to understand whether they would qualify and what the rules of the game are.""

The program covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits. Companies must show a 30-per-cent drop in revenues, a cliff that may discourage companies from growing, lest they find themselves suddenly cut off from federal aid.

""You don't want people to think that you get over the threshold and then automatically lose"" the subsidy, said Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress.

Yussuff also said the extension would bring some stability to reopening phases, and likely bolster job gains seen over May and June.

Last week, Finance Minister Bill Morneau hinted at changes to revenue-reduction thresholds when he spoke about reducing ""disincentives to growth"" in the program.

Kelly said the government could consider a graduated approach with smaller subsidies at lower levels of revenue loss, or dropping the requirement altogether, either of which would give employers the confidence to rehire faster, Kelly said.

The Liberals originally saw the wage subsidy as the key tool in helping cushion the economic blow from COVID-19 by helping workers stay tied to their employers so businesses could get back to normal quickly once lockdowns lifted.

The pace of spending on the program has been below expectations, with $18 billion paid to 252,370 companies as of July 6.

Instead, the budget for the program dropped as more workers accessed the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for people who lost their jobs or nearly all their hours.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

The budget for that program is now at $80 billion, but it's scheduled to end in the fall. Yussuff said the government needs to soon release details on how workers without jobs will transition to the employment insurance system, which was largely supplanted by the CERB.

The government's fiscal and economic ""snapshot"" last week boosted the cost of the wage subsidy program to $82.3 billion from $45 billion, in a sign of impending changes.

Perrin Beatty, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said changes to the wage subsidy ""must encourage Canadians to transition"" off the CERB, and ""create a positive incentive to return to work.""

The July 8 fiscal update noted that small employers make up the largest share of approved wage subsidy applications, with the largest numbers of employees covered in manufacturing, accommodation and food services.

The ""snapshot"" also said men may be ""slightly more likely"" to be covered than women although there aren't firm numbers to rely on.

Adrian Dix said during a news conference Monday that warnings of possible exposures at a restaurant, spin studio, bed and breakfast and resort are believed to stem from ""private parties"" at the hotels.

Eight positive tests for the disease are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city's waterfront between June 25 and July 9, said an email from Interior Health, the regional health authority.

""When people come together for private parties — in this case it was primarily people in their 20s and 30s — the risks are considerably higher,"" Dix said.

The exposures follow the move to a new phase of reopening in B.C. that allows for tourism within the province. Although the accommodation industry was not ordered to close during the pandemic, many operators did so voluntarily but began welcoming guests again as part of the new phase.

Infections in B.C. inched up on Monday as health officials announced 62 new cases since Friday.

Two more people also died for a total of 189 deaths in B.C.

The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 3,115, while 2,718 people have fully recovered from COVID-19.

Interior Health also issued an isolation order for Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver after two positive tests associated with the farm. Public health officials are monitoring the situation and placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm, the government said in a news release.

The cases linked to Kelowna involved people who live in three regions of the province, including the Interior, Fraser and Vancouver Coastal Health regions, said Dix. He credited contact tracers with making the connections.

He said the tourism industry has done a good job of creating safe environments for guests, but it's also up to guests to ensure they respect physical distancing guidelines and group size limitations.

""Whether it's a trip or a party at home, the same risks and the same rules apply,"" Dix said.

If you're gathering with friends and family, you should consider the increased risk that indoor locations pose and determine how many people can maintain a safe distance accordingly, he said.

""We have got to live with COVID-19 for the next year so that means the responsibility is on all of us to understand the risks and understand our responsibilities to one another.""

Interior Health issued an exposure advisory for the resort and bed and breakfast on Friday and added the restaurant and spin studio in a statement on Sunday.

Visitors to the Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 or the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to July 5 were advised to self-isolate and monitor themselves closely for symptoms.

The health authority is now urging visitors to Kelowna's Cactus Club restaurant on Water Street between July 3 and July 6, or the Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 to self-monitor and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms appear.

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control also warns that a case or cases were confirmed on an Air Canada flight from Kelowna to Vancouver on July 6, but Dix could not say if that warning was linked.

Public health contact tracing is underway and the health authority said it's reaching out directly to anyone who has been exposed, where possible.

Testing is recommended for anyone with novel coronavirus symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or a loss of taste or smell, said Interior Health.

""Milder symptoms may include runny nose, fatigue, body aches ... diarrhea, headache, sore throat, vomiting and red eyes,"" it said in a statement.

Anyone with even mild symptoms is urged to stay home and avoid travel.

Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 include physical distancing, regular hand washing, not touching the face and avoiding gatherings of more than 50 people, the health authority said.

Powell River-Sunshine Coast MLA Nicholas Simons has been adapting to new ways of carrying out democracy, mandated by regulations required to cope with the pandemic.

article continues below

Simons said he is going to be attending the legislature next week for the first time in what is being called a hybrid session. He said this means some people are in Victoria and others are functioning in their communities via videoconferencing.

“It’s very busy and there are a lot of issues that are related directly to the pandemic that I assist with when I can,” said Simons. “There continue to be issues for me relative to other sectors, including, of course, ferries, forestry and other ongoing interests.”

Simons said up until now, every day the legislature sits, he has been going onto Zoom and participating in the debate. He said if he is rostered to be doing his chamber duty in the legislature, such as next week, he simply attends in Victoria, where the number of MLAs has been substantially reduced due to physical distancing and maximum assembly numbers.

He said one significant change in legislative business has been the voting schedule. Rather than votes taking place during the day, they all get lined up and voted on at the end of the day, negating the need for everyone to be at their computer constantly from 10 am to 6:30 pm. The system, for the most part, has been working well, although there is the occasional glitch, said Simons.

There was one situation where the MLA who was voting remotely could not be heard, and so the clerk at the table phoned the member and got confirmation regarding the member’s vote.

Simons said those running and coordinating the hybrid system have done an “amazing job.” There are four screens in the legislative chamber and those in that setting can see members participating from their constituencies.

Simons said this is the first time a hybrid form of parliament has been conducted, so once again, BC is leading the way.

He said Question Period has taken on a new dimension because the chamber is not packed with close-together bodies “stuffed like sardines.” He said the opposition still has the opportunity to ask questions and the government has the chance to explain its actions on issues.

“It’s important for democracy,” said Simons.

When asked if British Columbians were being well served by the new system, Simons said: “I hope so. We’re making every effort to adjust the needs of our communities. There are challenges that everybody is facing.

“What we have to continue to do is figure out how government can best help our communities, our businesses, our industries and get to the challenges that are lying before us.”

Simons said with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the incredible focus by health minister Adrian Dix, and his dedication to the issue, has served the province well. He added that Dr. Bonnie Henry, as provincial health officer, has all of the necessary abilities to give confidence to the public.

“In this kind of situation, when you have dedicated people, incredible changes have been made to our health system,” said Simons. “We were prepared for the worst and we managed to relay good medical advice and the vast majority of people adhered to the recommendations and continue to do so.

“The message is as important today as it has always been. I’m completely confident that our government and our health officer have done their absolute best and the statistics indicate that we have been an outlier in our success.”

The new normal in the legislature has no horizon. Simons said the impact of COVID-19 will be present for a while.

“We are doing what we need to do,” he added, “and everybody recognizes that British Columbia can continue to stay strong.”",[]

The province said in a document released in late April that Stage 3 would include ""opening all workplaces responsibly"" and ""further relaxing the restrictions on public gatherings.""

The document didn't get into specifics, though it did say restrictions would remain on large gatherings such as concerts and sporting events.

Meanwhile, health officials in Quebec, the epicentre of the pandemic in Canada, are concerned about a spike in COVID-19 cases in Montreal linked to the reopening of the city's bars.

Over the weekend Montreal's public health authority urged patrons and employees who have frequented bars since Canada Day to get tested for the coronavirus.

Quebec reported 114 new COVID-19 infections Sunday, boosting its total to 56,521 cases.

The province is to introduce mandatory masks on public transit starting today, with a two-week grace period before users will be denied service as of July 27.

Montreal has also indicated that it intends to bring in mandatory masks for enclosed public spaces as of that date.

""I can't say no to a good time,"" said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. ""I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.""

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

""Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,"" he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

""You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,"" said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

""The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,"" Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when — not if — his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

""We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,"" said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

""It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,"" Merhej explained.

""I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.""

Shaw told reporters on a Zoom conference call that he was ""a little tone deaf"" with the tweets last Friday that were ""out of frustration"" and that he took responsibility for them and didn't want them to become a distraction.

""I apologize for that, at no point was I saying I was going to break the rules or we're going to break the rules,"" Shaw said. ""We know as a team that's not an option and to get through this season, everybody is going to have to buy in and everybody is going to have to adhere to whatever protocols we're set under.""

He noted if other teams don't follow public-health guidelines, the season may be derailed in any case.

Shaw had raised concerns about the length of time players may need to stay in their current environment. He replied to a tweet from TSN reporter Scott Mitchell, who reported that multiple sources told him players could face a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ballpark — which also are the same maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act.

""We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much,"" Shaw tweeted.

In an email reply, the club said arriving in Toronto, players understood the maximum penalties for leaving the Rogers Centre footprint during camp.

""The rules have kind of changed a little bit from when we first got up here, it was the first I was hearing about that we could be possibly be in here all summer,"" Shaw said, adding he should've chosen his words differently.

He explained he'd rented a place one block from the Rogers Centre and had looked forward to taking walks by the water to get away from the game. Living in a hotel was not an ideal situation, he said.

Shaw said Blue Jays management — president Mark Shapiro and general manager Ross Atkins — spoke to players on Saturday about the situation.

""I was a little bit tone-deaf to the situation, I should have said what I said, should have worded it a little bit differently,"" Shaw said. ""I apologize for that, take full responsibility.""

The Blue Jays are training in Toronto while figuring out where to play this coming season as the shortened 60-game schedule starts in less than two weeks.

Ottawa has given the ball club the green light to hold training camp in Toronto, but hasn't made a call on games. No fans will be in the stands.

The Buffalo News reported over the weekend the club had checked in with that city about playing in that city, usually the home of the their triple-A club. Blue Jays officials have said Dunedin, Fla., the club's spring-training facility, is the most likely venue for home games if the team can't play in Toronto.

For his part, Shaw said he and his teammates are hopeful Toronto is the club's home this season.

He noted that weather and the COVID situation in Florida means that Dunedin would put the Blue Jays at a competitive disadvantage.

The Blue Jays are slated to open the season July 24 at Tampa Bay. The home opener is July 29 against the Washington Nationals.

Shaw said he doesn't foresee opting out of the 2020 season, given he was looking to this year as a bounce-back season on a one-year contract after an admittedly poor 2019.

Meanwhile, Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said right-hander Chase Anderson is day-to-day with an oblique strain.

Anderson was projected to be a member of the Blue Jays' five-man starting rotation.

Testing has doubled over the last month, going from about 25,000 tests per day to almost 50,000, but the percentage of people testing positive has risen even more dramatically. A month ago, fewer than 5% of tests came up positive on a daily average. Over the past week, the daily average exceeded 19%.

About 10.7% of Saturday’s 143,000 tests came up positive, with an average age of 38. ""I still think we need to increase our testing a little bit more,"" said University of Florida epidemiologist Dr. Cindy Prins, adding that the state and local health departments should ramp up their contact tracing.

Prins said that she's still concerned about large crowds, gyms and some restaurants as being places of mass transmission. Reports of illegal clubs and raves in South Florida is also a worry, she said.

""I really do think we could control this, and it’s the human element that is so critical. It should be an effort of our country. We should be pulling together when we’re in a crisis, and we’re definitely not doing it,"" she said. ""I know people want to live their lives. There have been a lot of other times, people have made those sacrifices in order to benefit our society. It’s almost like a war effort. That’s what we need right now.""

Terry Shaw, AdventHealth’s president and CEO, said Sunday on CBS’ Face the Nation that the peak of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Florida will be ""sometime in front of us in July.""

While on the program, he said that the health system, which has hospitals in nine states including 30 in Florida, has adequate PPE, a stockpile of ventilators and a clinical team that’s learned how to better treat the disease.

""I give you an example. Our length of stay in our ICU for COVID patients has dropped in half. The number of people coming in to our hospital with COVID that need a ventilator, we’ve also been able to cut that in half. And because of those things, our death rate has also been cut in half"" since the beginning of the pandemic,"" he said

The health system’s ICU capacities in Florida are currently running at about 85% to 90%. He said the system could turn some ""progressive care units"" into ICU units if needed.

Hospitals in several counties have stopped doing elective surgeries. HCA West Florida have ceased inpatient elective procedures at hospitals in Hillsborough, Pinellas and six other nearby counties, said an HCA spokeswoman on Sunday. Florida ceased elective surgeries statewide from March until early May in order to free up beds, and to reserve personal protective equipment for health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients.

Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach are the top three counties for hospitalizations, with 3,232 people hospitalized — 42 per cent of the 7,542 people in hospitals statewide for coronavirus.

Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez told CNN on Sunday that his county's hospitals will soon reach capacity, but he said more beds can be added, including for intensive care.

""We still have capacity, but it does cause me a lot of concern,"" he said.

Throughout May and into June, the state reopened much of its economy with some restrictions — and the number of positive cases began rising, but it wasn't until the last week that the daily death total began rising, too.

Because of the increase in cases and the positivity rate, doctors have predicted a rise in deaths, saying the mortality rate usually increases two to four weeks later as some of those infected get sicker and eventually die. Health experts are concerned that people are gathering in crowds, and have expressed concern that the Republican National Convention's nomination party for President Donald Trump will be held in Jacksonville in August.

On Saturday, the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom reopened at Walt Disney World in Orlando, concerning health experts who urge people not to gather in groups. Guests at the park said that people were wearing masks and social distancing, and videos showed near-empty parks.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that even with the rising rates, he still wants the schools to reopen as scheduled next month, saying children have not proven to be vectors for the disease in states and countries where campuses are open. He said while each county will have to come up with procedures, depending on their local infection rate, not opening the schools would exacerbate the achievement gap between high- and low-performing students.

""We know there are huge, huge costs for not providing the availability of in-person schooling,"" he said. ""The risk of corona, fortunately, for students is incredibly low.""

Helen Ferre, a spokeswoman for DeSantis, said Sunday that the state has tested more than 2.4 million people for COVID-19.

Ferre said the important statistic isn’t the raw number of positives, but the percentage — on Sunday, it was just over 11%, about 8 percentage points lower than the weekly average.

""The more people who get tested and are proportionately reporting negative for this virus is meaningful,"" she wrote in an email to The Associated Press.

Meanwhile, a commissioner for a county near Jacksonville is seriously ill with the virus, according to a posting by his daughter on Facebook.

St. Johns County Commissioner Paul Waldron had recently voted against a county ordinance requiring masks, but not because he opposed them. He said he wanted more answers from county administrators about which masks are most effective and whether the county had enough for employees and visitors at government buildings.

So what about 142 days?

""Every game might end 0-0,"" the Calgary Flames general manager quipped.

With summer training camps set to open Monday as the NHL lurches forward in its plan to restart a season stopped in its tracks four months ago by COVID-19, the temptation might be to spring a surprise or two — maybe a new power-play setup or a tweak to the penalty kill — when the games return Aug. 1.

Coaches for the 24 teams set to feature in the league's return have had ample time to plan, brainstorm and re-assess their systems and rosters. The 16 taking part in the best-of-five qualifying round have known for nearly seven weeks which opponent they'd be lining up against if the league got back up and running.

But don't expect to see massive changes — especially early — from the men standing behind the benches in those empty arenas in Toronto and Edmonton once the puck is dropped.

They have enough to worry about when it comes to their own players.

""Every coach is going to look at and break down the opponent and have a game plan to attack,"" continued Treliving, whose club will take on the Winnipeg Jets in the qualifying round. ""But because of the uniqueness of this time, there's more of a focus to get your team ready. I remember last year preparing for the playoffs and we're sitting there going, 'What are we going to do with the four days between our last regular-season game (and the playoffs)?'

""We thought we had two months to prepare last year and we were dealing with four days. You're dealing with four months here. So the focus for the 24 teams is how do we get up to speed? How do we get to our 'A' game when we haven't played for so long?""

Like most teams, Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien and his staff met remotely via video conference on a regular basis after the NHL suspended the schedule because of the pandemic in mid-March.

And after it was announced they'd be facing the Pittsburgh Penguins in the qualifying round, those preparations ramped up significantly.

""I'm a believer that as a coach you can never get too much information — as much as you can get is great,"" Julien said. ""The important part is what you share with your players. That's where you have to be careful.""

Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said his focus will be shaking off the rust and getting his group prepared for a situation that will see teams go from zero to 100 in short order.

""There are significant challenges from a mindset standpoint and making sure that we get out of the summer hockey mode or the social distancing skates into real competitive hockey,"" he said. ""Because that's what we're going to be faced with in a short period of time.""

But Toronto Maple Leafs winger Zach Hyman, whose club is set to face the Columbus Blue Jackets in the qualifying round for a spot in the usual 16-team playoffs, still believes there could be some subtle changes around the league.

""This is the unknown,"" he said. ""When you go in from the regular season into playoffs, you don't really tweak too much, you just kind of roll into the playoffs, rolling off your momentum from the regular season. This is a completely different beast, where what you watched a couple months ago may not be the team that you're playing against in the summer. It's almost like a brand new year with the same rosters.

""It'll be interesting to see how everything turns out around the league with the long layoff.""

Canucks defenceman Christopher Tanev said he expects Vancouver's coaches to have plenty to share about the Minnesota Wild.

""I'm sure they'll have a lot of information,"" he said with a smile. ""They'll know every little detail about the team and every player.""

The Wild, however, shouldn't expect more than the basics on the other side.

""It's unique that we've known who we're playing here for a while,"" Minnesota interim head coach Dean Evason said. ""The challenge, at least for our group, is we don't want to overload them.""

The Boston Bruins are in a slightly different position as one of the top-4 teams in the Eastern Conference. They'll take part in round-robin games against Washington, Tampa Bay and Philadelphia to determine the No. 1 seed on that side of the playoff bracket, but the Bruins won't know their first-round opponent until after the qualifiers.

""We're not going to introduce a whole lot of new concepts,"" Boston head coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""Even though you've had a lot of time to dream up a lot of different things, I don't know if it's the best time — a short turnaround with a lot of the line — to start messing too much with your game.

""We're going to try to keep it as simple as we can.""

For all the time coaches have had, that might end up being their best play.

Ferries is loosening some restrictions and increasing capacity as summer travel within the province grows.

Passenger numbers have risen to about 70 per cent of what they were at this time last year, said Tessa Humphries, communications manager for B.C. Ferries. In the early days of the pandemic, they were about 20 per cent of normal.

article continues below

Passenger capacity had been capped at 50 per cent, but that restriction is being phased out to increase service, Humphries said.

That level was set by Transport Canada, which gave operators a choice between limiting capacity and implementing enhanced cleaning and physical- distancing measures.

Humphries said B.C. Ferries implemented both measures at first but has now decided to phase out the capacity limit. B.C. Ferries consulted with Transport Canada on the change, she said.

Enhanced physical-distancing and cleaning protocols, including clear plastic barriers and face- coverings, remain in place. Passengers are asked whether they’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms prior to travel, and those in vehicles are allowed to remain inside their cars.

More than 300 sailings per month have been added on major routes between the Island and the Lower Mainland since the start of June. The company is aiming to keep capacity about 20 per cent above demand, Humphries said.

“We will have fewer sailings than in summer schedules of the past, but significantly more than what was available as a result of the service cuts in April,” she said.

The company has also added an additional vessel on the route between Departure Bay and Horseshoe Bay on Fridays and Sundays, and a second vessel on the route that services the southern Gulf Islands on Thursdays through Mondays.

“We did also hear from the communities that there was a struggle for capacity there,” Humphries said, adding that it wasn’t uncommon for sailings on Gulf Islands route to be completely booked.

Passengers travelling by car are encouraged to book in advance or choose less busy times to travel.

Humphries said B.C. Ferries expects it will take a couple of years before passenger numbers return to pre-pandemic levels.

Onboard food services have resumed on some minor routes, including between Swartz Bay and the Gulf Islands, and the Passages gift shop reopened Friday on sailings between Swartz Bay and Tsawwassen. Packaged food and limited hot food resumed on three major routes between the Island and the Lower Mainland in June.

The Lands End Café in the Swartz Bay terminal also recently reopened. Markets in the Departure Bay and Tsawwassen terminals reopened in late June.

The drop in ferry traffic has cost B.C. Ferries millions of dollars in lost revenue.

Humphries said the company is evaluating the financial situation daily and reopening onboard amenities will provide another revenue stream.

“But we’re all doing all of that carefully and gradually, as well as safely reintroducing these services,” she said.

But even the best efforts have left doctors stymied about the source of more than one-third of this country's known COVID-19 infections. Not knowing where cases come from makes outbreaks that much harder to stamp out.

article continues below

Now medical researchers and supercomputers are turning genetics labs into virus detective agencies, looking first to find the novel coronavirus itself within blood samples from thousands of infected patients, and then comparing all of those isolated viruses to each other looking for places they differ.

Every close match will draw a line from patient to patient, ultimately painting a picture of how the virus spread.

""This is the big effort over the next four weeks,"" said Andrew McArthur, director of the biomedical discovery and commercialization program at McMaster University.

""What's going to come out of there pretty soon is a glimpse of what just happened, how did it move around the province, how did it move between provinces or how big was Pearson (airport) in the early days of the airport being open.""

Knowing how the virus spread will show where there were weaknesses in public health measures early on, said McArthur. Being able to keep divining genetic codes from samples will mean when there are flare-ups of cases, they can be quickly compared to each other to see if they're all related or are coming from multiple sources.

It means, for example, a long-term care centre should be able to quickly know if its 10 new cases are because one case spread widely or arose from multiple carriers coming into the facility.

""That's a very different infection-control problem,"" said McArthur.

It also means that maybe, just maybe, the second COVID-19 wave most think is coming won't be as bad, or as hard to control, as the first, because the sources can be isolated very quickly.

""A second wave is likely,"" McArthur said. ""But we've never spent this kind of money and effort before, either, so maybe we'll beat it.""

The kinds of genetic technology being used for this project did not exist when SARS hit Canada in 2003.

This genetic mapping is constantly on the look-out for mutations. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2, the official name for the virus that causes COVID-19, has not mutated as quickly as many others do. Influenza, for instance, changes so much over a year the vaccine has to be retooled every summer to keep up.

But there are enough subtle changes still happening among the 28,000 individual markers that make up a genome for SARS-CoV-2 that cases can be traced backward and linked to the ones that came before. McArthur said it takes a lot of data storage, a lot of high-capacity computer analysis, and a lot of money, to run the comparisons among them all.

The federal government put $40 million on the table in April for genetic research on COVID-19. Half is to keep tabs on the virus as it spreads, look for any changes it undergoes, and map its pathway across the country. The other half is to look at the genetic structures of the patients who get infected, trying to answer the puzzling question of why some people die and others have symptoms so mild they never even know they are sick.

Genome Canada is administering the project, with six regional genomics agencies overseeing the work locally and labs like McArthur's doing the testing and analysis. The funding is intended to create genetic maps from 150,000 patients. Canada thus far has had about 108,000 positive cases, and the expectation is that almost every one of them will be gene-mapped.

The results will be loaded into a global site comparing all known infections of COVID-19, but also be analyzed for national and regional reports.

In New York, genetic sequencing was used to figure out that COVID-19 in Manhattan wasn't coming from China and Iran as imagined, but from Europe. In Canada, it is suspected that much of the virus came into this country from travellers returning from the United States in early March. But the work is only now beginning to confirm that belief.

McArthur estimates the first data will be available for Ontario in about four weeks, but warns it will take many more months to complete all of the tests. His lab sequenced 600 samples on Wednesday alone.

Overall, McArthur expects the genetics project to last for two years.

Trump flew by helicopter to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in suburban Washington to meet wounded servicemembers and health care providers caring for COVID-19 patients. As he left the White House, he told reporters: ""When you're in a hospital, especially ... I think it’s a great thing to wear a mask.""

article continues below

Trump was wearing a mask in Walter Reed's hallway as he began his visit. He was not wearing one when he stepped off the helicopter at the facility.

The president was a latecomer to wearing a mask during the pandemic, which has raged across the U.S. since March and infected more than 3.2 million and killed at least 134,000. Most prominent Republicans, including Vice-President Mike Pence, endorsed wearing masks as the coronavirus gained ground this summer. Republican governors have been moving toward requiring or encouraging the use of masks as the pandemic has grown more serious in some states in the South and West.

Trump, however, has declined to wear a mask at news conferences, coronavirus task force updates, rallies and other public events. People close to him have told The Associated Press that the president feared a mask would make him look weak and was concerned that it shifted focus to the public health crisis rather than the economic recovery. They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private matters.

While not wearing one himself, Trump has sent mixed signals about masks, acknowledging that they would be appropriate if worn in an indoor setting where people were close together. But he has accused reporters of wearing them to be politically correct and has retweeted messages making fun of Democratic rival Joe Biden for wearing a mask and implying that Biden looks weak.

Questions remain whether Trump will wear a mask with any regularity.

The wearing of masks became another political dividing line, with Republicans more resistant to wearing them than Democrats. Few masks were seen at recent Trump campaign events in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Phoenix and South Dakota’s Mount Rushmore.

The only time Trump has been known to wear a mask was during a private part of a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan.

A spokesman for the Biden campaign cast the president's action as too little, too late.

""Donald Trump spent months ignoring the advice of medical experts and politicizing wearing a mask, one of the most important things we can do to prevent the spread of the virus,"" spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. ""Rather than taking responsibility and leading, he wasted four months that Americans have been making sacrifices by stoking divisions and actively discouraging people from taking a very basic step to protect each other.""

On its website, Walter Reed carries this recommendation: ""Whenever you’re out in public, like at your local grocery store or pharmacy, where it’s difficult to maintain 6 feet of social distance, you should wear a cloth face covering."" The facility also notes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the coronavirus.""",[]

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be ""modest"" at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

article continues below

""When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I'm quite sure this is less than one per cent,"" he said.

""The reality is, it's not going to move the needle.""

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a ""reasonably meaningful positive"" morale boost to Canadian sports fans who've been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL's hub cities on Friday night.

""The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,"" Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren't allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey's return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

""The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,"" said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

""They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.""

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to ""pander"" to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

""Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, 'We exist. We're on the map. Come look at us,'"" he said.

""But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It's not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.""

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with ""beauty shots"" of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

""You never know,"" he said. ""Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.""

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

""If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario's COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,"" she said.

""If those two come together it's just going to be the most beautiful thing.""

Collins made the comments in a July 8 update on summer travel and the impact of COVID-19 on the ferry service.

article continues below

Local governments on the Sunshine Coast and the Southern Sunshine Coast Ferry Advisory Committee have been pressing Ferries to add more trips to the Langdale-Horseshoe Bay route to meet the anticipated demand from residents, businesses and tourists now that travel within the province is no longer being discouraged.

Although BC Ferries is now running eight round-trips a day on Route 3, with two additional sailings on Fridays and Sundays starting July 10, there have still been frequent overloads and delays.

In a recent letter to BC Ferries, Sechelt councillors pointed out that the Sunshine Coast economy is “heavily reliant on tourism” and reduced capacity on the Langdale route could “limit our community’s recovery.”

“Our vision for Route 3 this summer is simple – provide the same level of service as last summer,” the letter said. “This would include the additional sailings we had last summer and maintaining increased time between sailings to ensure ferries run on time.”

Councillors in Gibsons are also sending BC Ferries a letter, asking the ferry company to “recognize the needs of small businesses on the Coast requiring deliveries of materials, including perishable goods, for their operations.”

In his update, Collins said traffic is beginning to grow again after dropping around 80 per cent in March and April and is expected to continue to increase throughout the summer.

“This summer, we are going to need your help, your patience and your understanding,” Collins said. “While we’re adding sailings as fast as we can, there still will be some sailing limitations this summer as we weren’t able to hire and train summer seasonal staff in March and April due to COVID-19. We are planning for summer service to exceed demand, but we won’t have the same number of sailings as last summer.”

Collins also acknowledged the inconvenience caused by schedule changes, some of which have happened on short notice. Sunshine Coast residents in particular have complained about trouble with rebooking reservations and long waits on hold with customer service.

“Over the past month or so, we’ve revised our schedules more often than normal, as we bring more sailings back into service,” he said. “I know this has impacted some of our customers, but every time we add more sailings, we need to revise the schedules one more time.”

Collins said BC Ferries is putting the bulk of its efforts into brining back service and is working with the province “to examine the impact COVID-19 is having on the ferry system.”

“We need to protect the core of the ferry system and continue to provide safe, reliable service to British Columbians.”",[]

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

B.C.'s provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a July 10 joint statement that the province recorded 25 new cases in the past 24 hours, for a total of 3,053 cases since the virus that has caused a global pandemic first appeared in B.C. in late January.

Blaney, in an interview on July 8, said she had just sat through a hybrid sitting of the House of Commons, which was “one for the record books.”

“We’ll see what happens next but it was interesting,” said Blaney. “There were some parliamentarians in parliament and the rest of them were across the country. When we are sitting in front of our screen, we are seeing our colleagues from all over in their offices and their homes. We are participating in our democracy in a completely different way.”

Blaney said as the parliamentarian who represents the NDP on the procedural and house affairs committee, what is being done by the committee is looking at what the House of Commons can look like in the fall, and how to address the issue of being able to do the full spectrum of work that is usually done, understanding that everybody cannot be in the house simultaneously. She said a report will come out and will be made public.

Blaney said there have been a lot of discussions at the committee level about security, such as with online platforms, and what kinds of methods should be looked at in terms of voting.

“We all know that is very important,” said Blaney, about voting. “If there is any voting happening now, it’s just the members in the house, percentage wise, representing each party. It’s definitely been an experience doing the work that you’ve done for your career but doing it in a very different way.”

Running the federal government in a hybrid system has many complexities. There are 338 parliamentarians, so accommodating the sheer number of people in the House of Commons and online is an issue. Blaney said one intricacy is that as parliament does its work, everything has to be simultaneously interpreted in French and English.

She said one of the things being looked at in the report is around the reality that in the last parliament, there was also some indigenous language spoken with an interpreter present, so there is a process that has to happen to allow that in the revised House of Commons.

“Now that we are in a different format of parliament, we are trying to find a way to follow the rules we’ve set for ourselves for that kind of flexibility,” said Blaney.

She said the committee has looked at other parliaments across the planet, seeing how other governments are coping with administration of democracy during the pandemic.

“I’m not sure what the final recommendations will be but I do believe there has to be a way to allow people who can only participate virtually to have a voice,” said Blaney. “It’s really important to honour those voices and make sure they have the capacity to represent their regions.”

In more remote areas of the country, where internet service is not as robust as it is in other areas, there may also be some issues with connectivity, said Blaney. She said the committee has worked closely with the House of Commons to make sure those issues are taken into consideration.

“If we’re in a position of taking a vote, how do we make sure those folks don’t miss out because of some sort of technical challenge that has happened?” said Blaney. “The committee has been looking long and hard into those issues, wanting to make sure we really honour parliament and the history of parliament, but recognizing that sometimes we have to adapt to these new circumstances.”

She said she is ultimately looking forward to going back to Ottawa and participating in parliament and seeing all of her colleagues there, because she thinks that part of the work is very important. Blaney acknowledges that a return to the old method of governance is an unknown. COVID-19 is the reality and everyone has seen how things have fundamentally changed, she added.

The work of the all-party COVID-19 committee in parliament is done, said Blaney, so parliamentarians will continue to meet through the hybrid system.

She said the hybrid parliament will be meeting at least four times this summer and it is something the NDP fought for during negotiations.

“We wanted to make sure, during changing times, the government was held to account twice a month over the summer months because things are changing quickly and we need the ability to ask questions and to hold the government to account during these very challenging times,” said Blaney.

She said the parliamentary structure is fundamental to Canada, and if it is going to be changed or altered, she said she hopes the government is thoughtful in how it is going to change it, and that parliament is not taken for granted.

“We need to focus on how we are going to do the work,” said Blaney, “in the middle of a pandemic.”",[]

Metro Inc. was aware of Loblaw Companies Ltd.'s decision to stop its so-called pandemic pay program before it made a similar decision, chief executive Eric La Fleche told the House of Commons standing committee on industry, science and technology Friday.

article continues below

La Fleche said that a Metro competitor's move was one of several influencing factors in its decision-making process.

He joined the Loblaw president and Empire Co. Ltd. chief executive at a two-hour session about why they stopped paying a temporary wage bump to employees as of June 13.

""Let me be absolutely clear, we did not co-ordinate our decisions,"" said Michael Medline, Empire CEO, in his opening statement before the committee. Medline, whose company owns the Sobeys and Safeway brands, was the first of the trio to give his opening remarks.

""The decision was our own.""

Loblaw president Sarah Davis echoed the sentiment, but noted she sent a ""courtesy email"" to both competitors, as well as Walmart and Save-On-Foods, on June 11. The latter two did not appear at the hearing.

The email notified competitors of Loblaw's decision to end its pandemic pay program on June 13. The company had already informed its roughly 200,000 employees, she said, and recognized ""the news would be public immediately.""

La Fleche said in later questioning that he was aware of the email when Metro made its decision to end its bonus pay program on the same day.

""We made our own decision based on the information we had, which included that last piece of information, yes,"" he said.

He called it ""one factor among others"" contributing to its decision. Other factors included the broader economic reopening, other retailers starting to open their doors, lower business volumes and a gradual return to more normal conditions.

Empire had not received Davis's email when the company made its decision to terminate the extra wages, said Medline, but had heard through the grapevine that Loblaw was considering doing so.

Davis received a reply to her June 11 email, and said she would provide copies of the original and all answers to the committee.

She also sent a courtesy email to competitors when Loblaw decided to begin its extra pay program. Davis said she doesn't recall sending courtesy emails to competitors on other topics, including executive compensation.

In addition to receiving the email, La Fleche said he made several phone calls to competitors in May and June to ask whether they planned to extend their bonus pay programs or end them on previously announced dates.

""In perfect compliance with The Competition Act, I asked my counterparts their intentions regarding whether or not they would maintain the temporary bonus,"" he said, in a translation from French, during his opening remarks.

In each case, competitors, including Medline from Empire and Davis from Loblaw, told him they had not yet decided.

""Whatever the case, those calls were made in a decisional process that was much larger and ... did not inform our decisions.""

When asked why he made the phone calls, La Fleche answered he ""wanted as much information as I could have in order to make a best decision for our company, our employees at the right time.""

He said he would ""absolutely not"" characterize those conversations as trying to obtain a tacit agreement on wages.

Those who sent emails and made phone calls said they consulted with company counsel before doing so and lawyers were present during at least one phone discussion.

The appearance was a chance for the executives to admit they were wrong to end the pay increases, said Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, a private sector union.

""What we got instead was highly paid grocery executives insisting they did not collude, and then going on to say — remarkably — virtually the same thing over and over again,"" he said in a statement.

""The executives all admitted to exchanging 'courtesy emails' and 'courtesy calls' on pandemic pay, and yet insist there was no collusion. I look forward to the committee's ruling on that.""

Unifor has been critical of retailers ending temporary wage increases while the pandemic continues and has called for the pay bump to be permanent.

The matriarchs, known as Gaandlee Guu Jaalang or ""daughters of the river,"" say in a statement the Queen Charlotte Lodge and West Coast Fishing Club reopened as a local state of emergency remains in effect because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

""Haida Gwaii is a remote community with limited health-care services and only two ventilators,"" the statement says. ""One case would devastate our communities.""

The statement says the matriarchs are upholding Haida law through the occupation of the villages, Jung and Sk'aawats.

Both the fishing lodge and club say they are fully complying with orders and guidelines issued by the B.C. government, health authorities and WorkSafeBC.

Brian Clive, vice-president of sales and corporate development for the lodge, said it has had several meetings with Haida leadership and developed plans so that workers do not go into town or anywhere near a Haida community. It also has medical staff on site and if a COVID-19 case were to develop, there's a plan in place to evacuate the affected person by air to Vancouver.

""We have gone to incredible lengths to avoid any contact with the communities and therefore have created what we call a zero-risk chance of contamination in the communities,"" he said.

The lodge expects about 80 guests at a time, down from the typical 125, he said. None will be travelling from the United States because the border is closed, he said.

President Brian Legge said the West Coast Fishing Club is remotely located about 83 kilometres from the nearest community and only accessible by boat or air. It also has an emergency evacuation plan in place.

""First and foremost we would never put the health and well-being of Haida Gwaii communities and residents at risk and equally as important our staff and clients,"" he says in a statement.

""That's why we have worked hard and gone to significant expense to eliminate all contact with the residents of Haida Gwaii and their communities through direct helicopter transportation from the mainland to our remote island and back.""

Without the plan, the club's employees would have been out of work and the business faced possibly unsustainable losses, Legge said.

The club is continuing to speak with the council of the Haida Nation, he added.

Duffy Edgars, chief councillor of Old Massett Village, said he supports the matriarchs and expected 20 to 30 people to occupy the villages. He said he didn't expect any interactions with lodge staff.

""We're just occupying our land and doing some fishing,"" he said.

Haida member Deana Young, who was on her way to support the matriarchs, said the community is following physical distancing protocols, while children have not returned to school and are not seeing their elders.

""One person coming from outside our region is one person too many,"" said Young.

The occupation of the land is an exercise of Haida rights to the land, she said.

""What we are doing is occupying our lands, asserting our rights to harvest the foods that we live on and to ensure food security for our communities,"" she said.

The new listing did not specify which seats were affected on the flights, meaning any passengers aboard the flight should “self-isolate and monitor for symptoms for 14 days after the flight.”

Travellers arriving to B.C. from outside of Canada are already required to file a 14-day self-isolation plan upon their return. For flight 696, that period of quarantine ended Thursday, July 9.

Cargill's beef plant near High River, south of Calgary, employs about 2,200 people. It shut down for two weeks in April because of an outbreak that affected 350 staff.

article continues below

It reopened after bringing in safety measures that included temperature testing, physical distancing, cleaning and sanitizing.

Eventually nearly half of the workers contracted the virus and two employees died.

The lawsuit, which needs to be approved by a judge, was filed by Guardian Law Group and seeks damages for the harm done to family members, friends and other people who were in close contact with Cargill employees who contracted the novel coronavirus.

The plaintiffs do not include the employees themselves, who are covered by labour and worker compensation laws.

The statement of claim alleges that despite warnings and guidelines issued by the Alberta government, Cargill Ltd. failed to take ""reasonable precautions"" at the beginning of the outbreak to limit its spread.

""This is a sophisticated facility and a company well-versed in proper safety procedures. That's why it's so shocking to see them fall so far below the standard of acceptable behaviour that we expect from employers in this situation,"" said Mathew Farrell of Guardian Law Group Friday.

""Businesses bear a responsibility to the community to take reasonable measures to limit the spread of this disease, and where they fail to do so, we will hold them to account for the harms that result.""

The allegations have not been proven in court.

Daniel Sullivan, a Cargill spokesman, said the company does not have a comment to make at this time regarding the class action. He gave a general statement in an email.

""At Cargill, we take seriously our responsibility to feed the world and that keeping people safe is core to our values.""

The High River plant is back at full operation and processes about 4,500 head of cattle a day — more than one-third of Canada's beef-packing capacity.

Cargill Ltd. is a subsidiary of U.S.-based Cargill Inc., one of the largest privately owned corporations in the United States by revenue.

The league and NHL Players' Association announced Friday the return-to-play protocols — featuring Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities — and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement have been ratified.

article continues below

The NHL board of governors and the union's full membership gave the documents, which were tied together in an all-or-nothing bundle, the thumbs up in separate votes.

""It was pretty civil,"" Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said of negotiations on the deal that was tentatively agreed to Monday. ""We're happy to get things going.""

Bringing the hubs to Canada, where coronavirus infection rates are largely under control, proved to be the logical choice after a significant spike in cases across the United States in recent weeks.

""While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,"" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. ""We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.""

Training camps for the 24 teams primed to compete in the league's restart to a 2019-20 campaign that was suspended March 12 are scheduled to begin Monday — also the deadline for players to opt out of participating with no penalty — in each franchise's home market.

The plan will then see Eastern Conference clubs report to Toronto on July 26, while those from the Western Conference head to Edmonton before the games resume Aug. 1. The conference finals and Stanley Cup will be held in Edmonton as part of a first-of-its-kind NHL Final Four that could stretch all the way to Oct. 4 and result in next season being pushed into December or early January.

Once in Canada's largest city and Alberta's capital, players are set to be kept away from the general public in so-called ""bubbles"" that include strict health measures, daily testing, and mostly confine teams to hotels and empty arenas.

The extension of the current CBA, which was slated to expire in September 2022 and now runs through at least the 2025-26 season, provides both players and owners clarity on a number of challenging financial realities caused by COVID-19.

It also give the green light for negotiations with the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation on participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Games. The NHL skipped the 2018 Olympics after taking part in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The salary cap's upper limit will remain at US$81.5 million in 2020-21 and stay there until hockey-related revenue returns to $4.8 billion — this season's projected total prior to the pandemic. Players have agreed to defer 10 per cent of next year's salaries, and have owners pay that back over three consecutive seasons starting in 2022-23.

""This agreement is a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time,"" NHLPA executive director Don Fehr said. ""We are pleased to be able to bring NHL hockey back.""

Escrow payments, a consistent thorn in the side of players that guarantees a 50/50 split of HRR with owners, will be capped at 20 per cent in 2020-21, and decrease throughout the deal. If teams are still owed money following the 2025-26 campaign, the CBA will be extended another season.

The agreement marks the first time in Bettman's 27-year tenure as commissioner the NHL has bridged two CBAs without a work stoppage. Both the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons were cut to 48 games because of lockouts, while the 2004-05 campaign was cancelled.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was the most outspoken politician with regards to having his province host one of the hubs, pointing to a low infection rate and Edmonton's facilities.

He also penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in hopes of securing a waiver for the NHL when it came to Canada's mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the country. The federal government approved the league's proposal of a cohort quarantine last month, granting an exception that paved the way for Toronto and Edmonton to get the nod as hubs.

Speaking outside Rogers Place, Kenney said Friday's news will create jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity.

""The Stanley Cup is coming back to Edmonton, to Alberta,"" Kenney said in a video posted to Twitter as he stood next to a statue of Wayne Gretzky. ""We are going to get an unbelievable amount of free advertising across North America and around the world that will set us up well for the future relaunch of our tourism industry when travel comes back post-COVID.""

The Cup was last awarded in Edmonton when Gretzky hoisted it over his head for a fourth and final time on May 26, 1988.

Each team will be permitted to bring a maximum of 52 people into the bubbles, including a maximum of 31 players.

Meanwhile, it was also announced the NHL draft lottery's second phase has been tabbed for Aug. 10. The eight losing teams from the qualifying round will have an equal shot at the first pick in the draft, which is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10.

Much like Kenney, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory supported their city's hub potential.

""There is no better place for the NHL season to continue,"" Tory said. ""We will make sure we put on a great show for the game of hockey ... while following all proper health and safety protocols.""

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said choosing to hold the NHL's restart in Canada reduces the overall risk, but it's far from a fool-proof endeavour.

""We'd be blind to think that there isn't COVID-19 in Canada, there's just significantly less of it here compared to parts of the U.S.,"" he said. ""Everyone has to pay close attention to COVID-19 because even with the best laid plans, there still can be small weaknesses that might be exploited by this virus.""

Vancouver was the other Canadian city originally in the running to host, along with seven American markets, before the provincial government expressed concerns about the NHL's health and safety protocols.

Ford was asked prior to Friday's announcement why the plan worked for his province when it didn't for British Columbia.

""They have very stringent rules and regulations for their players,"" Ford said of the NHL. ""When they told me (players are) getting tested every single day, I'm no medical professional, but I don't think they need testing every day.""

The 24-team format — which includes every Canadian franchise, save for Ottawa — will see the top-4 clubs from both the East and West play mini-tournaments to determine playoff seeding, while the other 16 will battle in a never-before-seen qualifying round.

Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia are set to compete for the No. 1 slot in the East, while defending champions St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas will do the same out West.

The East's best-of-five qualifying series include Pittsburgh vs. Montreal, Carolina vs. New York Rangers, New York Islanders vs. Florida and Toronto vs. Columbus. In the West, the matchups are Edmonton vs. Chicago, Nashville vs. Arizona, Vancouver vs. Minnesota and Calgary vs. Winnipeg.

In all, there will be as many as 52 games played over the first nine days before the teams get a break on Aug. 10.

The four winners of the best-of-five series in each conference will then be pitted against the top-4 seeds to fill out the usual 16-team playoff bracket.

There could, however, still be choppy waters before the 2019-20 season can actually resume.

Players won't be quarantined during training camp, but instead asked to practise physical distancing when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during voluntary workouts, 23 results came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in those optional sessions.

The Stanley Cup has been awarded every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish flu outbreak and in 2005 when the lockout scratched the entire season.

There's now a firm plan in place to — hopefully — see it handed out this fall.

Finance Minister Carol James said Friday the latest numbers paint a picture of cautious optimism with a long road ahead on B.C.'s path to recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

Gains in May and June bring back about 40 per cent of the total number of jobs lost since the start of the pandemic in February, when B.C.'s jobless rate was five per cent, she told a news conference.

The greatest losses have been in the service sector, but James said that's also where jobs are being added as accommodation and food services accounted for half of last month's gains.

Despite positive signs, James said thousands of people and businesses are still struggling, and net job losses stand at 235,000.

She said youth unemployment in particular stands out at 29.1 per cent, up slightly since May, while 45,000 young people did find jobs last month.

Women in B.C. are also more likely to have lost their job due to COVID-19 than men, James said.

She said the high jobless rate in June reflects increased demand for jobs and confidence that people will have the opportunity to return to work once they start looking again.

James also mentioned the loss of international visitors in the tourism sector, particularly in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, as a factor.

Businesses are restarting cautiously, she added.

""They're making sure that their employees are safe, they're making sure their customers will be safe, and people are starting to see that confidence by going back to businesses.""

James is set to provide more information next week on the post-pandemic spending B.C. has made so far, as well as updated revenue and deficit forecasts.

B.C. health officials reported 25 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, as well as one additional death.

That brings the death toll to 187 among 3,053 people who have tested positive for the disease so far, Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

Of 187 active cases, 16 people were in hospital, and there were ongoing outbreaks at two long-term care or assisted living facilities and one acute care facility.

While there are no active community outbreaks, Dix and Henry said exposure is still happening.

""When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others,"" read their statement.

For the past four months, the legendary Toronto stage that's hosted the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Police has gone dark, and its famed checkerboard floors immortalized in the Tragically Hip's ""Bobcaygeon"" left empty.

article continues below

Like most smaller Canadian music venues, the future is anything but certain.

""The live-venue industry right now in Canada is on the verge of bankruptcy,"" Cohen said.

""We're not opening, probably, until the end of this year — maybe next year... We have no income coming in whatsoever. It's a bad scene.""

Along with several other indie concert venue owners, Cohen has been making noise about the troubling years ahead for Canada's live music scene in hopes the federal government will take more action.

There was a glimmer of hope on Tuesday when Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault outlined a program that lets owners of for-profit venues apply for a piece of $20 million promised to support the live music sector.

The money will be divided among numerous corners of the industry, including venues, concert promoters, booking agents, managers and music festivals. The funding is part of the second phase of support in the $500-million emergency support measures introduced in May for Canada's arts and culture organizations.

Anyone who's granted approval will receive a minimum contribution of $5,000 that's supposed to last until the end of September.

Beyond the live music business, the federal government has earmarked $5 million for the recording industry that will be administered by Factor and Musicaction, which specialize in developing and supporting Canadian music talent.

Erin Benjamin, chief executive of the Canadian Live Music Association, which advocates for the industry, called the move by Canadian Heritage to support venues ""a good start"" that needs to be built upon in short order.

""It's better than nothing,"" she said.

""It'll help some companies for a very short amount of time...but we're not done here. We can't be done.""

While Cohen doesn't know if he'll qualify for a portion of the venue funding, he's skeptical about how much it'll actually help the Horseshoe.

""I'll be able to pay two weeks of rent,"" Cohen said, pointing out it's roughly $40,000 a month for the downtown location.

""It'll be something, and we'll be grateful for it... but I'm skeptical until I actually see the payments.""

He suspects the Horseshoe may also fail to meet some of the requirements outlined on the Factor website. Among them, a venue must have booked at least 50 per cent Canadian musicians at its venue last year to qualify.

""Horseshoe Tavern was open 360 days last year, I don't think we wrote down which bands were Canadian and weren't. I don't think we even know,"" Cohen said.

""The eligibility makes no sense.""

Smaller venues have been able to tap into other financial support measures, which include the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the emergency wage subsidy.

In Toronto, city council recently passed legislation that allows property owners to claim a tax break of 50 per cent tax on spaces that operate primarily as live music venues. The intention is for those savings to trickle down to the tenants who are still not allowed to reopen.

Live venues in other Canadian cities are at different stages in a process many anticipate could stretch well into next year.

Vancouver bars were some of the first to reopen, though several clubs in the city warned that patrons may have been exposed to COVID-19 in recent weeks.

Montreal's music venues were allowed to legally reopen in late June, but concertgoers have to remain seated and dancing is forbidden.

In Halifax, Karen Spaulding reopened the Carleton Music Bar and Grill in the final days of June, but it hardly feels the same to her.

""It is at half capacity for three days a week, instead of normally five to seven, and it's acoustic shows only,"" she said.

""Just the world, the audience and the guests, all feel different.""

The Carleton operates as a restaurant, which helped Spaulding's attempt to get the business back on its feet, though she said overall revenues have dropped somewhere between 50 to 75 per cent.

But as much as she's concerned for her business, she's also worried about local Canadian musicians who relied on these venues to make a living. That's motivated her to look for solutions as she faces a long winter that brings a whole new round of questions.

Spaulding said she's been in conversations with lenders, while also tapping into other government programs that help support her staff. She's also looking into whether it would be worthwhile to launch streaming online concerts that would ""put more money in the artists' pockets"" over the coming months.

""I'm going to personally go out on a limb to keep the venue going,"" she said.

""We're huge believers in live music.""

But as a resurgent COVID-19 ravages the U.S., fuelled by cavalier openings in states like Florida and Texas and a White House determined to resurrect the economy at all costs, the red-alert status spreading across the continent's lower half has more Canadians than ever ignoring America's increasingly persistent knock.

An online poll by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies released this week found a whopping 86 per cent of respondents in Canada opposed to letting U.S. tourists north of the border, compared with 11 per cent who supported it. An Abacus Data poll out Friday found much the same thing.

And when Rep. Brian Higgins, a New York Democrat, updated his bipartisan call for a plan to reopen the border, the ensuing Twitter barrage of sarcasm, satire and outright anger belied Canada's reputation as a bastion of civility, replete with memes of building walls, slamming doors and Bugs Bunny taking a handsaw to the 49th parallel.

Higgins took it all in stride.

""I don't blame them for wanting us out of there,"" the congressman said Friday of the Canadian reaction.

""I have an obligation to be honest, and I have an obligation to always keep trying. And if anything, what I hope will come from all of this is an appreciation for the tale of two neighbouring countries' response to COVID-19: America's has been deplorable, and the Canadian response has been fast, strong and united.""

When the outbreak first took hold in North America in March, Canada and the U.S. agreed to close their shared border to discretionary travel while allowing the movement of goods and essential workers to continue. That initial 30-day agreement has been extended three times now, and will surely be extended again before its next July 21 expiry date.

Since March, the U.S. has seen more than 3 million cases and 133,000 deaths, and the crisis is accelerating in states across the union. Florida is breaking records daily for new COVID-19 cases and deaths. In Arizona and Texas, one in four tests is coming back positive. Further north, states like Wisconsin and Michigan are seeing fresh spikes in their active caseloads. Hospitals are again rapidly nearing capacity.

In their letter last week to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Canada's Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, Higgins and 27 other members of Congress, Democrat and Republican alike, urged the two countries to stop kicking the can down the road and draft a detailed plan for the gradual reopening of the border.

""The continual 30-day extensions without a plan for how restrictions will be modified prolongs uncertainty for both communities and creates unnecessary tension as we approach each new expiration,"" they wrote.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions.""

That doesn't mean throwing open the border to Americans, Higgins said. But it could mean redefining essential travel to include foreign property owners and people with business interests or family members on the other side, provided they wear masks and practice physical distancing.

""Never in our lifetime have we had a situation where the health of you and your family is dependent on your fellow citizens to do the right thing,"" he said.

""A phased opening could expand the category of 'essential traveller,' but (include) certifying some way that you are adhering to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's protocol as it relates to stopping the spread of COVID-19.""

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a pro-trade conservative and longtime champion of Canada-U.S. ties, has been among those urging zero tolerance at the border until the crisis in the U.S. has passed — a position spokeswoman Ivana Yelich reiterated Friday.

""The premier has been clear: the border must remain closed to non-essential travel until the U.S. has made significant progress in containing COVID-19,"" Yelich said. ""The recent spike in the number of COVID cases in the U.S. is very concerning. As such, the premier will continue to support restrictions at the U.S. border beyond the July 21 deadline.""

The worsening public health situation in the U.S. has not diminished the importance of cross-border business travel, including face-to-face meetings or technical on-site visits, to the health of Canada's economy, said Mark Agnew, director of international policy with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

Despite the best efforts of both countries, the current border measures have been confusing for some, causing stress and delays even for those who have work permits that allow them to cross, Agnew said.

""It would be helpful for the government to set out the circumstances under which border measures will start to normalize, to enable companies to plan.""

Despite the political challenges the U.S. outbreak now poses for the federal Liberal government in Canada, it's past time to start thinking about how to ease the border restrictions, said Laurie Trautman, director of the Border Policy Research Institute at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Wash.

""There is an immediate need to be more thoughtful and strategic about how our countries go about doing that,"" Trautman said, floating the idea of wider family exemptions and allowing homeowners to visit their foreign properties.

In northern Washington state, law enforcement is growing concerned about the challenge of protecting vacant homes owned by Canadians, she added.

""Grandparents should be able to see their grandkids,"" Trautman said. ""Exempting these two groups from the restrictions would not ‘open up the floodgates’ and seem reasonable and empathetic to me.""

Statistics Canada's labour force survey released Friday showed 953,000 jobs were added last month, including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions. The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

article continues below

As in May, even though more people found jobs, more people were also looking for work as the labour force grew by about 786,000 after a gain of 491,000 in May, bringing it to within 443,000 of its pre-pandemic level.

Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate would have been 16.3 per cent had it included in unemployment counts those who wanted to work, but did not look for a job.

Job gains were made in every province, including by 378,000 in Ontario, marking the first increase since the COVID-19 shutdown, Statistics Canada said. It didn't include any gains in Toronto as restrictions in that city loosened after the survey week.

Despite the good news, economist Jim Stanford said there remains a historic crisis in the job market with high unemployment and hundreds of thousands who have left the labour force altogether.

Also, gains nationally were not shared equally among groups, with women, youth and low-wage workers still slower to rebound, which Stanford said could be problematic if those jobs don't ever come back.

""I worry about a coming second round of layoffs motivated not by health restrictions, but by companies deciding their businesses are going to be permanently smaller. So that would be qualitatively different and in a way worse,"" said Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work in Vancouver.

""We aren't remotely out of the woods yet, but this was a really encouraging step forward.""

Some three million jobs were lost over March and April due to the pandemic, and 2.5 million more had their hours and earnings slashed. By last month, some 3.1 million were affected by the pandemic, including 1.4 million who weren't at work due to COVID-19.

Brendon Bernard, an economist at Indeed Canada, said recapturing jobs at the same pace in the coming months will be tougher.

""A lot of areas of the economy still aren't running at full capacity,"" Bernard said. ""So while doors may be open and customers might be coming in, business hasn't come back to normal.""

Despite the overall improvement, the oil and gas industry continues to struggle.

The PetroLMI Division of Energy Safety Canada says direct oil and gas employment fell by more than 6,700 positions in June compared with May, with about 70 per cent of the net job losses in Alberta.

Compared with a year earlier, employment in the oil and employment sector was down 17 per cent.

The overall job losses were unprecedented in speed and depth compared with previous recessions, Statistics Canada said, and the rebound to date sharper than previous downturns.

Ottawa's response has been equally unprecedented: a deficit of at least $343.2 billion this fiscal year as the Trudeau Liberals dole out some $230 billion in emergency aid.

In June, 28.3 per cent of Canadians aged 15 to 69 reported receiving some form of federal aid since mid-March, Statistics Canada said. Meanwhile, the proportion of households reporting difficulty paying the bills dropped to 20.1 per cent in June from 22.5 per cent in May.

""Without the federal government being there to support Canadian workers, Canadian businesses and the Canadian provinces and territories, we would be in a bigger mess in this country right now,"" Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress said in an interview this week.

The Bank of Canada and federal government believe the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

In a statement, federal Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough touted the overall jobs numbers as a sign the government's plan was working, before adding many Canadians still ""face real challenges during this time.""

She and other ministers are now reshaping programs so fewer workers stay on the $80-billion emergency benefit, and more get tied to jobs through the $82-billion wage subsidy program.

""We understand the need for those emergency programs. We also understand as we reopen and recover, we have to move away from emergency programs and into stimulus and recovery,"" said Leah Nord, senior director of workforce strategies for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

She said there are other issues to resolve around health and safety in the workplace, transit, and child care to help more Canadians get back to work.

In provinces where daycares reopened for children five and under, employment levels returned to pre-pandemic levels for fathers in June, but not for mothers. Similarly, mothers with children under 18 were more likely than fathers to work less than half their usual hours in June, Statistics Canada said.

Job gains have come at a faster clip for men. Their unemployment rate hit 12.1 per cent in June compared to 12.7 per cent for women. And the underutilization rate — which counts those who are unemployed, those who want a job but didn't look for one, and those working less than half their usual hours — was 28.3 for women and 25.5 per cent for men.

Economist Armine Yalnizyan said the numbers underscore the need to provide child care as well as options for schooling in the fall so mothers can work.

The alternative, she said, could pull back any economic gains.

""It means that even if there are jobs, some women won't be able to take them because there's no way they can leave their kids,"" said Yalnizyan, a fellow on the future of workers at the Atkinson Foundation.

""So we are looking at the potential for an economic depression instead of talking about paces of recovery and pivoting to building to better.""

Three Cabinet ministers in the administration of Bolivian leader Jeanine Áñez have also tested positive for the virus, including Health Minister Eidy Roca and Presidency Minister Yerko Nuñez, who is hospitalized.

article continues below

The infections in Venezuela, Brazil and Bolivia, which is seeing a spike in cases, come after Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández tested positive in June and was briefly hospitalized.

Áñez said she will remain in isolation for 14 days when another test will be done, but she will continue to work remotely from the presidential residence.

""I feel good, I feel strong,"" she wrote on her Twitter account.

Bolivia’s Health Ministry says the Andean country has 42,984 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,577 deaths, and is seeing a rebound in the number of new cases amid reports that hospitals are being overwhelmed in some regions. In the highland city of Cochabamba, scenes have emerged of bodies lying in the streets and coffins waiting for days in homes to be taken away.

Bolivia is scheduled to hold a presidential election Sept. 6. Áñez is running third in opinion polls. Former Economy Minister Luis Arce, who represents the party of ousted President Evo Morales, is in front, with ex-President Carlos Mesa in second.

In Venezuela, meanwhile, socialist party chief Diosdado Cabello revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19, making him the highest-ranking leader in the distressed South American nation thus far to come down with the virus.

Cabello is considered the second-most powerful person in Venezuela after President Nicolás Maduro and made the announcement on Twitter, stating that he is isolated, getting treatment and will overcome the illness.

""We will win!"" he wrote in conclusion.

Economically struggling Venezuela is considered one of the world’s least prepared countries to confront the pandemic. Hospitals are routinely short on basic supplies like water, electricity and medicine.

The nation has registered considerably fewer COVID-19 cases than others in the region, but the number of infections has grown in recent weeks. As of Wednesday, the government had reported 8,010 confirmed cases and 75 deaths.

Cabello was last seen Tuesday, when he met with South Africa’s ambassador, Joseph Nkosi. Photographs released by the government showed him standing alongside and bumping fists with the diplomat while wearing a black mask.

The 57-year-old politician is head of the National Constituent Assembly, an all-powerful legislative body created by Maduro’s government in 2017. He had missed his weekly television program Wednesday, stating at the time that he was ""fighting against a strong allergy"" and resting.

Maduro said in a broadcast Thursday that Cabello’s diagnosis was confirmed with a molecular exam — a test that is usually conducted with a nasal swab sample. Venezuela has done far fewer of these tests than neighbouring countries, instead largely deploying rapid blood antibody tests. Some experts fear that relying so heavily on the rapid tests, which don’t detect signs of illness early in an infection, means cases are being missed.

""Venezuela is with Diosdado,"" Maduro said. ""I am sure soon enough we will continue on in this fight.""

In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Tuesday.

He appeared Thursday on an online broadcast from the presidential residence as defiant as on previous occasions. He coughed once, but did not show other symptoms of the disease that has killed more than 69,000 people in the South American nation.

Bolsonaro repeated his view that the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic is more dangerous than the coronavirus itself. He insisted that mayors and governors need to reopen the country for business.

""We need governors and mayors, within their responsibilities, to reopen commerce. Otherwise the consequences will be harmful for Brazil,"" Bolsonaro said, wearing a gray shirt and sitting comfortably in front of two national flags.",[]

The Montreal-based company announced Thursday that it is sending notices to terminate the leases at the 124 stores to take effect in 30 days. The move would affect about half of its workforce of nearly 2,500, including all 366 employees in the United States.

It will also seek more favourable lease terms for the remaining 100 stores in Canada and may permanently shut additional locations if landlords are unwilling to negotiate suitable leases.

It had warned in mid-June that it could begin a formal restructuring depending on the outcome of its talks with landlords.

The company said at the time that it hadn't paid rent on any of its stores for April, May and June.

The store closures are part of its restructuring plan after it obtained court protection from creditors under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and Chapter 15 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

""With the upcoming closure of 124 unprofitable stores across North America, we are certainly making good progress in creating a stronger business model for the future and ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of DavidsTea and our beloved brand,"" company founder and interim CEO Herschel Segal said in a news release.

Chief financial officer Frank Zitella said that with the closure of ""a significant number of money-losing stores"" it will focus exclusively on e-commerce sale which had a penetration rate of close to 43 per cent in the market before COVID-19.

""All 100 remaining DavidsTea stores have been closed since March 17 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain so until further notice,"" he stated.

DavidsTea last month reported that it lost $23.2 million last year on $146.5 million in revenues. That includes a US$4.3 million loss in its fiscal fourth quarter on US$54.8 million of revenues.

The move by DavidsTea comes three years after Starbucks announced the closure of all of its Teavana brand stores. The coffee giant acquired Teavana Holdings in 2012 for US$620 million.

The cancellation of the 2020 national football championship game because of COVID-19, and U Sports not altering an age eligibility rule, accelerates the swan song of roughly 300 football players.

article continues below

U Sports has said student-athletes whose championships are cancelled in 2020-21 because of the pandemic will not lose a year of eligibility.

But football players have seven years after graduating from high school to complete their five-year eligibility. Many play junior football before entering the university ranks.

The only U Sports sport with an age limit is football.

University of Calgary quarterback Josiah Joseph of the defending Vanier Cup champion Dinos is among those caught in a rule designed to limit the age of players in Canadian university football to under 25.

Players who turn 25 before Sept. 1 age out of university football. Joseph turns 25 on July 10, 2021.

Approximately 300 players out of 2,335 will be similarly impacted in 2021, according to U Sports.

Joseph hoped U Sports would make an exception for players like him.

""All they would have to do is amend the rule and push it to maybe January first due to extreme circumstances,"" he told The Canadian Press.

""It's devastating there's that many players in my position.""

U Sports adopted a football age cap to prevent large gaps in physical maturation and experience between players in a collision sport, and also to create room on rosters for younger players, according to U Sports interim CEO Dick White.

""I really understand the disappointment of the players that this affects,"" said White, who took over for departed CEO Graham Brown last month.

""Our legal advice that we received was very firm. If we believe the age cap should be 25 for the health and safety of athletes then we should not under any circumstances alter that.

""The reasons for having that age cap have not changed even though we've had the tragedy of COVID.""

Joseph argues there is no physical or experience difference between a player who turns 25 in March and one who turns 25 in October.

""There's already 25 year olds playing in the league so what's the difference of a couple months?"" he asked. ""There is none.""

U Sport cancelling the 2020 Vanier Cup and the two bowl games — Mitchell and Uteck — that serve as semifinals doesn't stop conferences from playing football in the fall.

But Canada West, Ontario University Athletics and Atlantic University Sport have already declared there won't be football in 2020 because of the pandemic.

The Reseau du sport etudiant du Quebec is still working on running football this fall.

University of Bisons head coach Brian Dobie points out fifth-year players aren't the only ones impacted.

Any current university football player whose birthday falls before Sept. 1 will lose a year of football eligibility because of the combination of the pandemic and the current rule.

""What about that kid who had two years left and he just got a starting spot? Now Johnny has one year left. What about Billy who had three years left and now has two years left?"" Dobie asked.

""If you have one kid in your program that is negatively affected by this, as a coach you should be outraged. Every kid should count just the same and you should be outraged.""

Losing a year of football eligibility also means losing a year of athletic scholarship to pay for school, Dobie added.

""The reality is the age cap is 25 and it's not 26 and somewhere you draw the line,"" White said.

""If the football institutions wish to re-address the age cap to 26 or no age cap, that's up to our member institutions. There's a process to do that.

""The big picture here was there was a very good reason we put the age cap in. Our board of directors, supported by the legal opinion, said 'don't move it.'""

Joseph doesn't buy that rationale.

""It doesn't seem like it's reflecting the interests of a lot of coaches and players that make up U Sports football that make it successful, the guys that are going to be there for five years who are going to graduate that are going to be proud alumni,"" he said.

""That's what makes up university football in Canada.""

In addition to the impact on each individual’s care, test data is critical to strategic planning and public policy.

As well as informing us, however, testing issues have also created a great deal of confusion and frustration. The terminology and specifics are new to most, and the criteria for and access to testing has fluctuated a great deal in a short period of time. After four months, here’s where we stand:

article continues below

Summary points

* Testing is now available to anyone with symptoms of COVID-19, however mild;

* Those needing COVID-19 assessment are encouraged to call their family doctor or nurse practitioner's office, call 811, or attend the hospital emergency department (ER);

* Powell River and qathet Region District have had very few confirmed cases of COVID-19 to date, but remain at risk for future outbreaks. Ongoing attention to public health measures is still critically important.

Criteria for testing

Most COVID-19 patients have cold or flu-like symptoms, though onset may be gradual over days. Those with severe symptoms should attend the ER without delay. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, lack of appetite, and loss of taste or smell. Headaches, confusion, runny nose, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and rashes are less typical, but may occur.

People without any symptoms (asymptomatic) are not generally tested in BC, except in special circumstances such as a public health investigation of an outbreak. In addition to using limited resources, testing asymptomatic individuals can lead to high rates of false positives (test is positive, but the person doesn’t actually have the virus). An online symptom checker is available at https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en, or through 811.

Where to get tested

People are encouraged to call their nurse practitioner or family doctor if they feel they may have COVID-19. In addition to reviewing criteria for testing, a primary care provider knows their patient's medical history and can direct them accordingly. Some clinics offer testing on site, including drive-through testing, while others will refer to another office or to the hospital.

Assessment and testing for COVID-19 at Powell River General Hospital is located in the ambulance bay of the ER. There is a separated space for one patient at a time, and it is cleaned after each use. Efforts are being made to reduce wait times, but these do vary.

Those coming to the ER for respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 assessment are encouraged to call ahead (604.485.3211), and will be directed outside to the ambulance entrance where there is a buzzer to advise staff on arrival. Testing is available 24/7, if needed.

People being assessed and tested for COVID-19 will only be brought into the main ER department if they need further investigations or treatment. Dedicated areas are used for this purpose.

Procedure for outpatient testing

Testing for COVID-19 involves essentially a small cotton swab on a plastic stick that is inserted into one’s nose, turned a few times, then removed and placed in a tube. Nasal swabs may make one’s eyes water, but are generally described as uncomfortable rather than painful.

Locally, all COVID-19 swabs are packaged at the hospital and flown to Vancouver once or twice daily for processing. Results are typically by 8 am the day after they are received in Vancouver.

Powell River Hospital has secured a small supply of rapid tests that can identify a COVID-19 result within an hour. Owing to the very limited supply, these are generally reserved for critical situations.

Most people with COVID-19 (over 80 per cent) will be well enough to stay at home during their illness.

After being tested, patients are given instructions and an information sheet on how to self-isolate until test results are available. Staying home when sick is considered by many experts as the single most effective strategy to limit COVID-19 in a community.

Results

To confirm a negative test people may wish to speak with their primary care provider, use myehealth.ca, or call the BCCDC negative results line between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm, seven days per week, at 1.833.707.2792.

Those with positive test results will be notified rapidly by Public Health. In BC thus far, over 98 per cent of positive cases were reached in under 24 hours. The family doctor or nurse practitioner will also receive the result.

If someone tests positive for COVID-19, a public health staff member will call them daily until they are cleared (usually 10 days if minimal symptoms). They will offer direction on self-isolation and help advise how to manage symptoms, including when to seek further care.

The public health team will also take a detailed history to identify who has had close contact with a positive case, including up to 48 hours before that person's symptoms first developed.

Those people identified by public health as having a significant risk of exposure (e.g. sustained close contact, household members, no physical distancing or protective equipment) will be notified as soon as possible, and will be advised to self-isolate (and to test if they develop symptoms). Contact tracing is not generally done for very brief, distanced, or other low risk encounters.

Future plans

Blood testing for immunity (i.e. past infection) is not yet available for routine use. It is still unclear how accurate these tests are, and how long immunity from natural infection can be detected.

As we move into the fall, we expect an increase in respiratory viruses of all types. Detailed plans for additional testing sites have been developed and will be implemented based on capacity and need.

Powell River data

Local medical officer of health Dr. Geoff McKee reported last week that the lower Sunshine Coast has had a total of six cases thus far in the pandemic, and that Powell River region has had fewer than five cases to date (because of the low number and the potential privacy risk for so few cases, the exact number was not given).

Dr. McKee also noted that there were no active cases being followed on the Sunshine Coast. Unfortunately, there could be cases that simply aren’t identified yet, or new cases that may arise at any time. For this reason, regardless of the exact number of confirmed cases, we all need to follow public health recommendations if we hope to protect our community from this virus.

A recent survey completed by the Powell River Division of Family Practice identified that roughly three per cent of people surveyed in our region have been tested for COVID-19. Several barriers to testing were identified by community members, which we are working to address.

Conclusion

While our region has had relatively little COVID-19 activity thus far, global cases continue to rise rapidly. Until there is widespread immunity or a universally effective treatment, we are all vulnerable.

Local physicians will continue to prepare and behave as if there are active cases in the community. Staying home when sick, washing hands, physical distancing with most people, and wearing masks or protective equipment when needed, continue to be the cornerstones of defence for all of us.

In addition public health measures, testing (and contact tracing) is an extremely powerful tool to limit the spread of COVID-19. Anyone who thinks they may have symptoms should call their family doctor or nurse practitioner, call 811, or attend our local emergency department.

Be smart, be safe, and be kind. We are in this together.

Nearly 30 per cent of Canadians with disabilities expect to be late paying their rent or mortgage because of the pandemic, but only 20 per cent of the general population is expecting to be in the same situation.

Almost 30 per cent of Indigenous people expect to borrow money for essentials, compared with nearly 20 per cent of the general population surveyed.

The poll was conducted online between April 20 and May 6 and talked to 936 Canadians, 38 per cent of which identified as financially vulnerable, up from 15 per cent in November 2019.

Seniors, in particular, are a focus of the report from the Senate's social affairs committee, from those in long-term care homes to those with low incomes.

Just this week, the Liberals rolled out one-time special payments of $300 to the more than six million people who receive old-age security, and $200 more for the 2.2 million who also receive the guaranteed income supplement.

The income supports are meant to help seniors facing increased costs as a result of the pandemic, such as more frequent prescription fees and delivery charges for groceries.

Senators on the committee wrote of evidence of ""financial insecurity and increased vulnerability"" for low-income seniors as a result of the first wave of the novel coronavirus.

A potential second wave, which could coincide with the annual flu season that starts in the fall, would make the situation even worse for these seniors ""without concrete and timely government action,"" the report says.

Senators say the Liberals should deliver a plan to help low-income seniors, among other populations vulnerable to economic shocks like new immigrants, no later than the end of August, and contain short- and long-term options.

The report also says the federal government needs to pay urgent attention to seniors in long-term care homes where outbreaks and deaths in the pandemic have been concentrated.

The document made public Thursday morning is the committee's first set of observations on the government's response to the pandemic, with a final report expected later this year.

Before then, the Liberals are planning to provide another economic update like the one delivered Wednesday, or possibly a full budget. The government shelved plans to deliver one at the end of March when the House of Commons went on extended hiatus due to the pandemic.

The long-awaited economic ""snapshot,"" as the Liberals styled it, said federal spending is closing in on $600 billion this fiscal year. That means a deficit of $343 billion, fuelled by emergency pandemic aid that the government budgets at over $230 billion.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada said the spending figures demand a ""full and transparent assessment"" to see what worked, what didn't and what needs to change for an economic recovery.

Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, said the Liberals should take back up their promise to create a national pharmacare system as the government considers its next steps.

A federal advisory council last year calculated the cost of a program at over $15 billion annually, depending on its design.

""The last thing we want to have is Canadians in frail health as we're dealing with this pandemic and I think the government really needs to think of that,"" Yussuff said in an interview Wednesday.

""Had it not been for the health care system we have right now,"" he added later, ""think of how this country would have fared in this pandemic.""

The Senate committee's report also notes the national emergency stockpile of personal protective gear like masks, gowns and gloves wasn't managed well over the years, nor sufficiently stocked when the pandemic struck.

Committee members added concerns that military members could be deployed without sufficient personal protective equipment because of ""inconsistencies from international procurement.""

The stock market crash in March and the plunge in interest rates left many investors feeling uncertain and vulnerable, while still more have been left without work.

Tina Cheung, a wealth adviser at Vancity, says it is always important to review your financial plan on a regular basis, but a review can be especially important during times like these.

""During these times of uncertainty it is important to have peace of mind, and to have that peace of mind, to achieve it, is to get a financial check up,"" she said.

Investors who were shocked at the state of their investment portfolios at the end of the first quarter might breathe a sigh of relief when checking their statements for the second quarter as stock markets have rallied off their lows seen near the end of March.

However, Canada's main stock index is still down from where it was a year ago and well off the highs it hit in February before the pandemic struck the markets.

""The effects of the pandemic on the market will eventually pass, like the global financial crisis did, but if these few months created any stress or loss of sleep, we need to go back and talk about your risk appetite,"" Cheung says.

But she says if your risk appetite has not changed and your goal hasn't changed, then it is critical to think long term and stick to your plan.

Before heading into a meeting with your adviser, it is important to have a firm grip of your budget and what your goals are for the meeting.

Cheung says you need to be prepared to have an open discussion and be ready with information like your monthly income and expenses.

For some, reviewing their financial plan may mean difficult decisions, facing depleted emergency funds due to the loss of a job and little prospect for a return to work at a level seen before the pandemic.

A poll done for TD Bank found that 38 per cent of those surveyed identified as financially vulnerable in April 2020 compared with 15 per cent in November last year. The poll also found that 13 per cent of those asked in April felt confident in their financial future compared with 20 per cent in November 2019.

If you have taken advantage of the payment deferrals offered by many lenders, you need to have a clear plan for when those deferral periods come to an end and you need to resume making payments.

Gio Bazile, a district vice-president at TD Bank, says some borrowers may start to struggle once the deferrals come to an end if their income hasn't picked back up again.

""Part of what is going to be really critical is understanding what your future cash flow is going to look like and how do you work with your financial adviser with an impending financial hardship, how do you best balance your wants and needs,"" he said.

Bazile says everyone is going to face their own situation, but it's key to have a candid conversation with your partner or family to understand where you are financially.

""If your cash flow is low or if you are kind of over-leveraged from a debt perspective, then that's probably a time to actually spend some time with your financial adviser,"" he said.

""If you're looking at your savings account and realizing, wait a minute, I may not be able to get through this next two, three months and beyond, that's probably another really big trigger.""

That is, if they can survive long enough to see daylight again.

Those were two of the conclusions in the most recent Restaurants Canada survey of its member businesses.

article continues below

The survey, which heard from nearly 1,000 restaurant owners representing more than 11,500 restaurants, found 56 per cent of restaurant owners believed it would require a year or more to recover from the pandemic, and that at least 50 per cent of them are currently operating at a loss. “Restaurateurs are eager to help rebuild the economy and revive neighbourhoods, but they’re going to need continued assistance from government to remain operational under ongoing restrictions,” said the organization’s vice-president, David Lefebvre.

The results of the survey come as no surprise to Ian Tostenson, president of the B.C. Restaurant and Foodservices Association.

While Tostenson said the provincial situation is a bit of a “mixed bag” of results as B.C. continues to open up its economy, he made it clear there is trouble in the industry.

“Of the nearly 15,000 restaurants in B.C. maybe 60 per cent are actually up and running,” he said, noting many have decided to remain closed temporarily as there’s no business for them and others have closed for good. “Some may never come back. We expect to lose between 20 and 30 per cent of the industry … it’s just too much to expect some of these small businesses to hold on.”

That is especially true in the major markets.

“Downtown Victoria and downtown Vancouver are just disasters,” he said. Downtown restaurants rely heavily on tourism and office workers to stay afloat. “Volumes in those two big markets are tracking 20-30 per cent of where they were at this point last year.”

On the upside, Tostenson said suburban operators and restaurants in small cities and towns around B.C. have reported doing alright.

Overall, he said, they are still dealing with the fact people aren’t yet feeling safe about going out to eat despite the myriad safety precautions the industry has taken.

The survey results have spurred Restaurants Canada to call for the federal government to extend and strengthen support for food-service businesses by maintaining the federal wage subsidy, extending and expanding rent-relief programs and expanding loans for small business.

The first time, he showed up an hour before the public testing site was set to close and was told they had reached capacity. He was turned away from a second centre when rain shut it down, and voluntarily left a third after someone ahead of him said they had been waiting in line for more than three hours.

article continues below

""If you have symptoms and you are just driving around the city trying to figure out how you can get a test, for people who are positive, it is not ideal,"" said Lee, who finally got a test on June 29 after he showed up at a site before dawn and waited for more than two hours. Another five days passed before he was able to view the results online, and he didn't receive a text with the results until seven days after being tested.

Four months, 3 million confirmed infections and over 130,000 deaths into the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., Americans confronted with a resurgence of the scourge are facing long lines at testing sites in the summer heat or are getting turned away. Others are going a week or more without receiving a diagnosis.

Some sites are running out of kits, while labs are reporting shortages of materials and workers to process the swabs.

Some frustrated Americans are left to wonder why the U.S. can't seem to get its act together, especially after it was given fair warning as the virus wreaked havoc in China and then Italy, Spain and New York.

""It’s a hot mess,"" said 47-year-old Jennifer Hudson of Tucson, Arizona. ""The fact that we’re relying on companies and we don’t have a national response to this, it’s ridiculous. … It’s keeping people who need tests from getting tests.""

It took Hudson five days to make an appointment through a CVS pharmacy near her home. She booked a drive-up test over the weekend, more than a week after her symptoms — fatigue, shortness of breath, headache and sore throat — first emerged. The clinic informed her that her results would probably be delayed.

Testing has been ramped up nationwide, reaching about 640,000 tests per day on average, up from around 518,000 two weeks ago, according to an Associated Press analysis. Newly confirmed infections per day in the U.S. are running at over 50,000, breaking records at practically every turn.

More testing tends to lead to more cases found. But in an alarming indicator, the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country, hitting almost 27% in Arizona, 19% in Florida and 17% in South Carolina.

While the U.S. has conducted more tests than any other nation, it ranks in the middle of the pack in testing per capita, behind Russia, Spain and Australia, according to Johns Hopkins University.

""I am stunned that as a nation, six months into this pandemic, we still can’t figure out how to deliver testing to the American people when they need it,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute. ""It is an abject failure of leadership and shows that the federal government has not prioritized testing in a way that will allow us to get through this pandemic.""

Testing alone without adequate contact tracing and quarantine measures won't control the spread of the scourge, according to health experts. But they say delays in testing can lead to more infections by leaving people in the dark as to whether they need to isolate themselves.

In other developments:

— While the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. hit 3 million Wednesday by Johns Hopkins' count, health officials have said that because of inadequate testing and the many mild infections that have gone unreported, the real number is about 10 times higher, or almost 10% of the U.S. population.

— A crowd of thousands attending President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in late June, along with large groups of people who showed up to protest, ""likely contributed"" to a dramatic surge in new coronavirus cases in the area, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said Wednesday. Tulsa County reported 261 confirmed cases on Monday, a new record one-day high, and another 206 confirmed cases on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

— Most New York City students will return to school in the fall two or three days a week and learn online the rest of the time under a plan announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio. He said schools can’t accommodate all their students at any one time and maintain social distancing. The school system in New York is the biggest in the nation, with 1.1 million students. It has been closed since March.

In New York City, the most lethal hot spot in the nation during the spring, testing was scarce early on but is now widely available. As many as 35,000 tests are conducted daily through a combination of private health organizations and city agencies, according to the city Health Department.

""Widespread testing holds the key to reopening our city safely,"" de Blasio said.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this week said it will open free ""surge testing"" sites in three hard-hit cities: Jacksonville, Florida; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Edinburg, Texas. The sites will be able to conduct as many as 5,000 tests a day in each city, with results in three to five days, officials said.

In Georgia, one of the states where cases are surging, officials are rushing to expand testing capacity as demand threatens to overwhelm six major sites around Atlanta, said DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond.

""If you project this out over the next three weeks, we can’t handle it,"" he said.

In New Orleans, people were turned away from a free testing site for a third consecutive day after it reached its daily allotment of tests. Health care providers are running low on trays and chemicals needed to run machines used in the tests.

Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego called the situation there ""desperate"" as residents have sat in sun-baked cars for up to 13 hours to get drive-thru testing. Robert Fenton, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said FEMA is doubling the testing supplies it plans to ship to Arizona.

Patrick Friday, a United Methodist minister in Alabama, went to several hospitals and clinics in Birmingham this week to get checked after his school-age son tested positive. But he was told that unless he had a preexisting condition, he didn’t qualify.

Finally, he ended up at a site offering rapid-result tests and his negative result came back quickly.

""We are several months into this,"" he said. ""How can it be that we can’t go in and get a test?""

""Unfortunately, as we don't anticipate ridership to be back to pre-COVID-19 levels in the foreseeable future, we had to make difficult decisions to deal with the situation as we gain a better understanding of the impacts of the pandemic on our operations,"" Cynthia Garneau, Via's president and CEO, said in a statement Wednesday.

The layoffs take effect on July 24. Affected employees will receive a temporary written layoff notice that respects their collective agreement's terms, the Montreal-based company said. It will maintain access to different programs for the employees.

The company is working to advance its service resumption plan and has seen some recent positive developments, though many routes remain interrupted.

Winnipeg to Churchill is the sole route in service, according to Via Rail's website, which was last updated June 26.

Several routes have partially resumed, while Toronto to Niagara Falls, Toronto to Vancouver, and Montreal to Halifax remain interrupted with all trains cancelled. Some of those routes are slated to resume service Nov. 1.

Via Rail said it plans to bring back employees ""as soon as the customer demand allows it.""

The passenger rail service has faced a rough year with rail blockades impacting service earlier in 2020.

""The current year has been filled with unprecedented challenges,"" said Garneau.

The company temporarily laid off roughly the same number of employees in B.C. and Ontario during rail blockades in the winter. The company said in March that most of those employees would be brought back early that month.

Some routes in those provinces were halted when protests in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en First Nation blocked railways across Canada.

Morneau delivered a ""snapshot"" of the federal finances Wednesday, for the first time since the pandemic brought much of Canada's economy to its knees.

article continues below

In the update, he said the government is well aware some segments of the population are hurting more than others.

""This crisis has exposed and amplified many inequalities in Canada,"" Morneau said.

The same people have in many cases also been affected more by the virus itself, in part because women, new immigrants, racialized Canadians and Indigenous people are more likely to work in the jobs where contagion is a risk, such as health care, retail and warehouse work.

The documents are careful to note that while racialized Canadians are more likely to work in economic sectors hit hard by the virus — including health care, accommodation and food services — little data has been collected to truly understand the impact on visible minorities and other marginalized communities.

So for example, there is no racial breakdown of who applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

Nor has much data been collected on the ethnicities of people diagnosed with COVID-19. One recent report from Ottawa Public Health said two-thirds of cases over the previous six weeks in its territory were racialized Canadians or new immigrants, but that report was limited in scope and for just one city.

The fiscal snapshot shows women, youth, low-wage workers, racialized Canadians, Indigenous people and new immigrants all saw higher rates of job loss or reduced working hours, and are also seeing slow, and in some cases no, benefits as the economy begins to recover.

Jobs in sectors dominated by men, such as construction and manufacturing, were faster to come back than those in service industries, tourism, and accommodation, where women and immigrants tend to be employed in bigger proportion.

New Canadians in particular have seen very little job recovery thus far, the report says.

Businesses owned by women and racialized Canadians were more likely to report declines in orders and clients, and a higher need for rent relief.

Women were also hit harder by the closing of schools and daycares, with women who have kids under the age of six reporting significantly larger declines in hours worked than women with no children or older ones.

""Going forward, anything we do must be about growth, resilience, and creating opportunity for those who were most impacted by this crisis,"" said Morneau.

""This pandemic has identified clear gaps and it’s giving us a chance to reset.""

Exactly how he plans to do that is not clear. The government has said some of the $14-billion aid package offered to provinces to help them safely reopen their economies needs to include child care investments.

""We've been very clear that having access to child care is going to be critically important for us to get back to work,"" Morneau said in a news conference with reporters. ""Women have been harder hit through the course of this pandemic and our measures therefore need to consider that challenge.""

But a month after Ottawa put the $14 billion on the table, the provinces have not yet accepted Ottawa's requirements for getting access to that money.

There is also little information about how the government intends to try to level the economic playing field so the gaps that led to inequalities going into the pandemic are closed.

Morneau said for now the government is focused on the safe restart of the economy and the longer-term recovery plan is still in development.

Green MP Elizabeth May said governments have to make child care and safe school reopenings a bigger priority because without those things, parents — and most often mothers — are not going to be able to return to work.

""We know that's an economic blow we can't risk and we know that's a step back for women's rights we can't accept,"" she said.

May said the snapshot was ""exception"" for the depth of its gender-based analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on women. She said the answer to stopping the damage is three things: ""Child care, child care, child care.""

“The court has gradually resumed some regular operations, including trials, chambers applications and other hearings and conferences, many of which proceed remotely,” B.C. Supreme Court Chief Justice Christopher Hinkson said in a July 7 directive.

“While the court has expanded the scope of its in-person operations, counsel, parties, litigants and members of the public are discouraged from attending courthouses unless their personal attendance is necessary or the court so directs,” he said.

B.C. Court of Appeal

In B.C.’s high court, the suspension of service and filing deadlines for existing appeals and chambers applications started March 18 and has been extended to July 27. As of July 14, parties may now request that appeal hearings proceed in a courtroom or by Zoom videoconference.

The court registry is accepting filings in all matters. In civil appeals, electronic filing remains mandatory for lawyers and optional for self-represented litigants.

The time periods for filing cases remains suspended.

“You can wait without concern that the limitation period to start civil or family proceedings will expire,” a July 7 directive from Chief Justice Robert Bauman said.

“Persons in the courtroom are not required to wear masks, but everyone may of course do so, except when addressing the Court at the hearing,” Bauman said. “Counsel/litigants must bring their own water supply and present their arguments from their own table (individual lecterns will be provided). Furniture will be cleaned and disinfected between hearings.”



B.C. Supreme Court

Effective July 13, in-person registry services will resume at all Supreme Court registries and the interim process for requesting a hearing of an urgent or essential matter will no longer be available, Hinkson said.

In criminal matters, bail and bail review hearings, detention review hearings, regular fix-date appearances and regular pre-trial conferences, COVID pre-trial conferences and case management conferences will continue by phone, a directive from Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes said.

Those using registries are recommended to continue using electronic, mail or fax filings where possible.

For family law matters, parties are no longer automatically relieved of the requirement to attend a judicial case conference before making an application by written submissions but that can still be done via phone.

Judicial case conferences already scheduled to occur on or after June 1 will resume by phone.

Civil and family trials scheduled to begin on or after June 8 have resumed unless otherwise directed.

“The resumption of civil and family trials may be subject to change as a result of limitations on available facilities or public health recommendations,” Hinkson said.

Jury selections remain cancelled until September. In civil cases where a jury notice has been filed and served, if all parties consent to proceeding by judge alone, they may seek such an order at a trial management conference.

Effective April 15, a ministerial order suspended limitation periods and mandatory time periods for the commencement of a civil or family proceedings from March 18, 2020 to the date on which the last extension of the declaration of the state of emergency.

“Once this suspension is lifted, more directions will be provided by the court,” Hinkson said.



B.C. Provincial Court

Chief Judge Melissa Gillespie announced July 8, provincial court would return to receiving all filings at the applicable court registry either in-person or remotely.

The provincial court had already begun re-opening June 15 courtrooms on a limited basis outside hub centres of Surrey, Vancouver Victoria, Prince George, and Kelowna where limited in-person hearings began a week earlier.

As of July 8, 2020, registries will accept all family cases filings. Small claims filings will be accepted July 13 while urgent small claims matters will only be heard by telephone.

Among the student-volunteer positions advertised as available on the I Want to Help website are 1,500 spots with YMCA Canada to help create online exercise regimes for kids and seniors in their communities.

article continues below

Yet the YMCA says those positions were actually the brainchild of WE Charity, the organization originally tapped by the Liberal government to administer the Canada Student Services Grant, and that the YMCA never agreed to them.

Both the YMCA and WE blame a miscommunication as WE scrambled to get the grant program — through which students can get up to $5,000 toward their schooling if they volunteer the maximum 500 hours — up and running as quickly as possible.

WE has since withdrawn from running the program.

In an interview, YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale said his organization proposed hosting 391 volunteers through dozens of YMCA locations. They would focus on three areas: helping local branches with marketing and website design; data analysis; and assisting seniors with tech questions.

The YMCA arrived at the number after reaching out to branches across the country, Dinsdale said, after which the national office drew up a draft memorandum of understanding with WE to formalize the arrangement.

""We sent a draft in and they sent a draft back and that's when we saw these other positions and we asked to separate them,"" he said of the 1,500 positions for online exercise regimes. ""And they said great. And we haven't heard from them since all this has gone down.""

""These discussions (with the YMCA) took place quickly, given our short timeline for delivery, and some confusion arose around the two separate agreements,"" WE said in a statement to The Canadian Press.

""That confusion contributed to a misunderstanding on our part which led to one group of service positions being posted, rather than the other group of service positions.""

It nonetheless means those advertised positions are not actually available.

The status of thousands of other positions apparently created by WE to meet the requirements of the volunteer program remains uncertain.

Youth Minister Bardish Chagger's spokeswoman Danielle Keenan stood by the Canada Student Services Grant program on Wednesday, saying that while there will be delays in its rollout following WE's departure, the government remains committed to it.

""The Canada Student Service Grants program provides opportunities for students who want to help with their communities COVID-19 response,"" Keenan said in an email to The Canadian Press.

""Although the delivery of the program will change, our objective has not changed which is to ensure students, not-for-profits, and communities are supported throughout the pandemic.""

WE and the Liberal government announced last week that they were ending a sole-sourced contract to have the charity manage the grant program after questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the organization.

Dinsdale said the YMCA did not know the 1,500 positions had been posted, noting the agreement with WE was never signed. At the same time, the 391 positions that the YMCA does want to fill have yet to be advertised. Dinsdale said the YMCA is waiting to hear from the government on those.

""The 391 that we're actually putting forward, our Ys are ready and willing to engage in it and there are some really interesting opportunities that could exist for youth and our YMCAs and communities,"" he said. ""So we're certainly hopeful those go ahead.""

Thousands of other positions posted on the federal website involve the creation of online content or the mentoring of other students on such topics as COVID-19's impact on the environment, nutrition and cyberbullying.

Some of those are posted in huge batches, such as a call for 1,000 volunteers to be trained to hold one-to-one sessions with people on ""the impact of COVID-19 on food security in your community.""

Another seeks 1,250 volunteers to devise ""social-media assets"" such as captions, memes and videos, for local and regional awareness campaigns to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

None of those postings includes the name of a hosting organization: they're listed as ""supporting local non-profits in your community"" rather than with a specific agency.

WE did indicate that it was behind many of them as it sought to meet the government's requirement that in order to be eligible for the student grant, positions must be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The purpose of the CSSG was to engage tens of thousands of post-secondary students in service programs to assist with the impact of COVID-19,"" WE said in its statement.

""COVID-19 has been in Canada for a relatively short period of time and there are limited new service opportunities related to addressing (it). This is partly why WE was brought in (to) develop and co-ordinate service roles that fulfil the program guidelines and deliver a meaningful impact.""

Employment and Social Development Canada, which will now administer the grant program instead of WE, did not respond to repeated questions about the positions, including whether they would move ahead or not.

Conservative employment critic Dan Albas said the questions about the federal website underscore the need for answers when it comes to the student grant program, including how positions have been chosen or created and what benefit they are expected to have.

""To find out that perhaps hundreds of positions have been put forward and in good faith maybe people have applied for those positions without having a correction from the government?"" he said.

""This is public money. They need to come clean and clean up this program so that any dollar that is spent gets the maximum opportunities for young people and value for money for taxpayer dollars.""

The service industry — which includes businesses such as hair salons, schools, hospitals, gyms, hotels and restaurants — have racked up 104 orders out of 334 issued to up to July 3.

The next most common industry to receive an order as of July 3, is the manufacturing sector, which includes meat processing plants, which have been hard hit by COVID-19, including a poultry plant in Coquitlam, as well as breweries, sawmills and pharmaceuticals.

In mid-May, an outbreak at Superior Poultry was declared over, and the plant allowed to re-open after instituting safety protocols.

Still, WorkSafeBC reports that most employers are doing their due diligence when it comes to meeting industry-specific guidelines.

However, when employers aren’t taking measures to protect workers from COVID-19 exposure, they could be issued an order for health or safety violations.

For the most part, though, employers have been taking the proper steps to re-open their businesses safely during the provincial re-start plan.

“Overall, the vast majority of employers are taking health and safety very seriously during the re-opening. Our inspections are finding that businesses want to be in compliance, and our prevention officers are providing support to help them have an effective COVID-19 Safety Plan,” stated Ivy Yuen, media relations representative in an email to The Tri-City News.

Data is not broken down regionally, so it is difficult to ascertain how many Tri-City businesses were given an order to beef up health and safety protocols.

Since, June 26, WorkSafeBC has conducted more than 12,000 worksite inspections in B.C. related to COVID-19.

The focus of these inspections has been to ensure employers have a COVID-19 Safety Plan in place, according to Yuen, who noted: “This plan needs to assess the risks to workers, and implement measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace.”

Orders are usually issued as a result of an inspection or can be part of a follow-up activity.

Data posted by WorkPlace BC online shows that employers have a lot of questions about how to manage in the new pandemic reality. In recent weeks, it has has fielded 9,823 questions, 1,728 reports of potential violations and 21 workplace incidents.

There have also been 12,646 inspections, with the large service sector receiving the most at 4,615, followed by 2,988 for trade-related businesses, which includes supermarkets, retail stores and gas stations, 1,256 for the manufacturing sector, 886 for primary resource companies, such as oil and gas, 234 for transportation and warehousing, and 180 for the public sector, including government and law enforcement.

Other industries are being ordered to improve their safety protocols, according to the data.

Inspectors have issues 65 orders for the trade sector, 60 for construction, 18 for primary resources, three for public sector and two for transportation and warehousing, which includes taxis and ride hailing.",[]

Golf Canada reports that there were 17 per cent more scores registered with the national sport body this June compared to the same month last year. A total of 1,483,506 rounds were submitted to Golf Canada's handicap calculator last month compared to 1,271,782 in June 2019.

""It was a pretty big jump from last year, comparing 2019 numbers to this year,"" said Adam Helmer, senior director of golf services for Golf Canada, on Wednesday. ""We were expecting that as golf has emerged as one of the safest activities, where people can be physically distant and we've reduced touchpoints.""

The surge in June ended a streak of three months when recreational rounds played in Canada dropped precipitously due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As restrictions were lifted across the country in May, the number of scores registered increased.

In May, 165,026 rounds were registered between the 1st and the 15th but 265,480 scores were submitted in the final two weeks of that month. The May 1-15 numbers are a nearly 40 per cent drop from the same period in 2019 (211,809) but the May 16-30 numbers are just five per cent lower than last year (269,266).

Helmer said he expects the number of rounds submitted to Golf Canada to continue to climb through July and into August.

""We've heard anecdotally that a lot of newcomers have joined the sport, especially now that school is done we're going to see an increase in juniors too. We think the trend is going to continue,"" said Helmer. ""Golf has seen a pretty big lift and it's emerged as the sport of the summer.""

The upward trend comes even as Golf Canada had to cancel all of its amateur and professional championships due to travel restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

A shift in how scores are registered has also been seen, with most recreational players entering their scores online instead of in the course's clubhouse or pro shop, which have largely been closed this summer because of physical distancing protocols.

Golf Canada plans to launch an updated version of its scoring app later this month, helping to keep players physically distant and improve their game.

He cautioned Wednesday (July 8) some “hotspots” still remain in long-term care and some agricultural setting.

article continues below

The prime minister made the comments in a media briefing ahead of a scheduled fiscal update — or “snapshot” — from Finance Minister Bill Morneau later in the day.

Trudeau said he would leave the details of the snapshot to his finance minister, but added it was imperative for the federal government to have acted right from the outset of the COVID-19 crisis.

“The cost of doing nothing would have been far more,” he said, adding the pandemic has not been a time for “belt-tightening.”

He said the country has been able to slow down progression of the novel coronavirus significantly and parts of the economy have since been able to reopen.

Trudeau repeatedly touted the nation’s historically low interest rates, which he said would help pay off the accumulated debt.

“If the federal government hadn’t taken on significant debt in order to send money to Canadians to support businesses and households, what would Canadians have done?” he asked.

“They would have loaded up their credit cards, they would have scrambled to try and find ways to pay their bills, pay their groceries and figure out how to care for their loved ones.”

The prime minister said he’s confident about the federal government’s response to the pandemic, which has included hundreds of billions in spending, because of the reduced spread of COVID-19 over the past four months.

“This recession is very different from the last recession,” Trudeau said, adding the 2020 economic problems are related to a health crisis.

“There are going to be really important discussions and political debates about what our economy looks like in the coming years.”

He stated earlier in the briefing that his government was also at work at addressing racial injustices that have been brought to the forefront of conversation following the death of unarmed Black man George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.

Trudeau said fighting discrimination is a top priority and mentioned the need for more capital to help fund racialized entrepreneurs.

The prime minister also faced questions on his involvement in the government’s decision to award the handling of $900-million student grant program to the WE Charity, which has longstanding ties to Trudeau and his family.

“The recommendation to use WE to get opportunities out for young people was made by the public service, but as a cabinet we ratify those decisions,” Trudeau said, adding he did not recuse himself from any cabinet decisions related to the charity.

“I love long worked on youth issues both before I got into politics and since I’ve been in politics.”

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador are meeting in Washington, D.C., Wednesday to recognize the ratification of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaces NAFTA.

Trudeau had earlier declined the invite from Trump but he was quick to reiterate his concerns over the potential for the Americans to reintroduce aluminum tariffs on Canada.

He once again said the U.S. does not produce enough aluminum to fulfill domestic manufacturing needs and any tariffs against Canada imposed by the Americans would hurt the U.S. economy by adding additional costs to customers.

Trump originally hit Canada with aluminum tariffs in 2018, citing national security concerns.

Most recently, she worked full time as a server at the Chateau Victoria Hotel’s Vista 18 restaurant for two years before being laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 17.

article continues below

“Growing up in Victoria where the hospitality sector is such an important part of our economy, I always thought that this would be a safe industry to work in,” she said Tuesday during a rally for hotel workers at the legislature. “As long as I worked hard and provided good service, I never worried about the insecurity of losing my job, until now.

“Since being laid off I constantly teeter on what tomorrow’s going to look like with financial burdens and obviously emotionally it’s impacted me heavily, as well.”

Only a few people have been called back to work at Chateau Victoria since the pandemic started, Spiteri said.

“And there’s no word on when the rest of us are going to be brought back to the hotel.”

Spiteri was among about 60 people demonstrating for a legal right to return to their jobs as the recovery from COVID continues. Participants were from Victoria, Vancouver and other parts of the Lower Mainland.

Spiteri said the level of insecurity she is feeling is “overwhelming.”

“I’ve been on [Employment Insurance] for a really, really long time and at this point I’m barely scraping by.”

The industry will eventually improve, she said. “Why won’t the industry promise to bring us back? Why won’t the government make that guarantee for us?”

Spiteri said she and other hotel workers at the rally have built careers in the hospitality industry.

“These aren’t just jobs, they’re a vital part of B.C.’s economy.”

Unite Here Local 40 organized the rally. The union has 6,000 members in B.C., including 500 in the capital region working at establishments such as the Chateau Victoria Hotel and Coast Victoria Hotel and Marina, said Stephanie Fung, union spokesperson. They are among more than 50,000 hotel workers in B.C.

The B.C. Hotel Association is seeking support from all levels of government to keep its businesses — and its jobs — alive, at a time when hotels are not profitable, even if many are open.

Ingrid Jarrett, hotel association chief executive, said it is critical that province extend the temporary layoff provision past the Aug. 30 end date and for the federal government to extend the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit in tandem. It proposes that those supports last until the sector regains 70 per cent of its historic revenues.

The association wants B.C. to allow municipalities to grant property tax relief for hotels.

Without this kind of help, Jarrett predicts a third of B.C.’s hotels could shut down.

“It is a very, very dire time and we have very limited confidence that the summer is actually going to allow many of the businesses to survive.”

B.C. has 83,000 hotel rooms in 1,252 hotels. Of those hotels, 25 per cent remain closed, she said. Those that are open are running at about 30 per cent capacity.

More than 80 per cent of hotels in B.C. are small and medium-sized businesses, she said.

Jarrett would like to see B.C. opened to travellers from elsewhere in Canada this summer.

The association is proposing that B.C. allow meetings and conferences, possibility by fall. They would follow health and safety protocols, and allow attendees from elsewhere in Canada and from international locations where the infection rate is low.

Frank Bourree, tourism consultant and vice-chair of the South Island Prosperity Partnership, pointed to the relationship between jobs and a healthy industry.

“The problem is that very few tourism businesses are going to be up to full capacity in order to bring everybody back, even through the fall. So is there even a job for them to come back to?

“I think it is great that they [workers] are bringing profile to the loss of tourism jobs here but there has to be an employer there to employ them. And the industry is really precarious right now.”

Employees need to be supported until their jobs come back, Bourree said.

Another key factor is that when the temporary layoff period winds up, employers have to pay severance. “For the employers, if they’ve got a huge severance hit, that might push them right over the edge into bankruptcy,” Bourree said.

Tourism represents 10 per cent of the employment base in the capital region, Bourree said.

Greater Victoria hotels are running at about 25 per cent occupancy, down from 80 per cent a year ago, he said.

“Nobody believes that we are going to see international travel into B.C. for the balance of this year.”

Even when a hotel is open, it is unlikely to be profitable, Bourree said. Most open hotels are operating on a “shoestring,” he said.

The challenge locally and within the rest of the province, is that B.C. visitors stay on the weekends and not during the week, meaning the industry is not filling enough rooms. Travellers from elsewhere in Canada and internationally typically stay long and stay during the week, Bourree said.

It’s easy for Canadians to look southward and shake their heads in bemused smugness at the daily penchant of Americans to indulge in conspiracy theories and demonizing of disfavoured segments of society.



But I’m getting a whiff of that attitude here in Canada now. It serves as a reminder how easily irrationality and fear can spark reactions leading to full-blown witch hunts and targeting of the “others.”

The past few days I’ve seen multiple news reports of people reporting cars with U.S. plates. For some, the immediate reaction was to assume the owners of those cars have no right to be where they are, and then make the irrational link that anyone who comes from the U.S. must be dripping with coronavirus that will spread to anything they touch.

article continues below

These fears were stoked by some unfortunate remarks by the premier, which were fortunately walked back by more measured remarks by Dr. Bonnie Henry.

This jump to conclusions affects me personally. Last month, my wife and I moved to Victoria from California. It is a move we have planned for five years and was irretrievably set in motion a year before anyone ever heard of the novel coronavirus.

But now that we are here — thoroughly inspected and interrogated by both CBSA and provincial health officials at the border and after completing our 14-day isolation (which confirmed our symptom-free condition during the three months of lockdown in California) — we are now faced with a very un-Canadian attitude of guilt-by-association for anyone whose car (as does ours) bears U.S. plates.

Leave aside the fact that COVID-19 spreads generally by transmission of fluids during close (usually confined, indoor) contact with someone else; leave aside the fact that wearing a mask and keeping distance are the two most effective ways to avoid transmission, wherever the suspected carrier hails from; leave aside the fact that the incidence of mask-wearing in B.C. seems far below what my wife and I expected and practise ourselves.

The mere fact someone belongs to a “suspect group” (owners of cars with U.S. plates) does not make them public-health pariahs; that is the heart of the conspiracy-driven, fear-mongering in the U.S. we Canadians rightfully disparage.

The news reports invariably actually talk with the car owners and discover that they are here legitimately.

But they fear reprisal from the unthinking, who are quick to grab their pitchfork and call for a witch-burning.

I know my wife and I are concerned about that as well, wondering if our car will be keyed by some anonymous COVID-19 vigilante; that’s why I ask my name not be reproduced with this letter.

While we all need to remain vigilant and compliant in fighting the pandemic, turning on superficial scapegoats without knowing their full story is no solution and just imports northward a different epidemic we should work equally hard to keep out.

The CFL is reportedly looking at playing in a single hub or two hub cities to limit teams' exposure to the virus. But Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at Toronto General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, said positive tests remain possible and could threaten play — just like in other leagues.

article continues below

""The short answer is nothing in this era is going to be without risk,"" Bogoch said during a telephone interview. ""There are certain things we can do to minimize the risk but as with anything, there's going to be some element of risk of acquiring this infection.

""The league and players can work with medical professionals to make this as safe as possible but at the end of the day they'll have to sit down collectively and decide, 'Is this worthwhile.' As individuals they'll have to ask themselves, based on the protocols in place and individual risk perception, risk tolerance and risk threshold, 'Am I willing to play?'""

The CFL and CFL Players' Association continue to discuss amendments to their current collective bargaining agreement that would allow for a partial '20 season. The earliest action would begin is September, but commissioner Randy Ambrosie has said a cancelled campaign also remains possible.

In March, the COVID-19 pandemic forced a global shutdown of sports. In Europe, pro soccer has resumed while domestically Major League Soccer, Major League Baseball, the NHL and NBA are all attempting to either restart or open their seasons.

But it hasn't been easy as all four North American circuits have had players or team officials contract the virus. FC Dallas was forced to withdraw from the MLS is Back Tournament in Orlando after 10 players and one coach tested positive.

The NHL hopes to open training camps Monday and resume play in Edmonton and Toronto on Aug. 1. Players would stay in tightly controlled bubbles and play games without fans.

Teams can bring 52 personnel, with no more than 31 players, to their hub. Everyone in the bubble will be tested daily — including players, staff, hotel workers, food service employees and bus drivers.

Players and team officials will remain inside the bubble except in specific extenuating circumstances. That includes medical attention, the birth of a child or death in the family.

Anyone returning to the bubble will be subject to a minimum four-day quarantine with daily nasal swab tests for COVID-19.

The NHL and NHLPA have the ability to delay, postpone, move or cancel games due to a ""risk to player health and safety"" and/or chance that ""the integrity of the competition"" is in jeopardy, including ""an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.""

However, perhaps the biggest challenge the CFL faces is a financial hurdle. Unlike other major sports entities, it doesn't have a billion-dollar TV deal and thus isn't flush with money.

Ambrosie has stated often the nine-team CFL collectively lost $20 million last year. That hardly puts it in an ideal position to cover food and lodging costs for its teams as well as daily testing.

Bogoch said regardless of the measures taken in a hub or bubble, positive test results are inevitable.

""Oh, 100 per cent and there already have been,"" he said. ""If they do proceed, I think the leagues and fans should be aware that anything can happen.

""The leagues could come to a halt should there be an outbreak or safety concern, individuals or teams might be pulled out. Quite frankly, as much as we want to have high expectations we should really lower them. We're in the COVID-19 era, anything can happen.""

No league has said a specific number of positive tests will result in the cancellation of games.

Bogoch said hubs and bubbles are beneficial. With the exception of baseball, the other three North American leagues are going with hub plans.

""First, they reduce the probability of introducing infection within the bubble,"" he said. ""If (infection) is introduced, it really reduces the probability that it can be transmitted.

""If there's infection it will hopefully be rapidly identified because of the high frequency of diagnostic testing and symptom checks. Now, the best-laid plans can still have holes in them but what we've seen with basketball and soccer is these plans work in that they've identified positive cases and players have been isolated. That tells me the safety mechanisms are working and that's fantastic.""

But the mounting positive tests have prompted many to question sport's return before the discovery of a suitable vaccine.

""The key is ensuring if you're going to play pro sports, you're doing it in a safe and ethical manner,"" he said. ""Safety really means player safety, safety of the auxiliary personnel but also public safety as well.

""Ethical manner means you're not drawing resources away from the community in which you're playing. Can that occur while there's still an ongoing push to ensure safety across the country and develop a vaccine and develop programs? I personally think if it's carefully planned out, they can both be done very well.""

Bogoch, a Calgary native, is a recreational hockey player in his spare time. But he also watches at least two CFL games each year: The Labour Day Classic between the Calgary Stampeders and arch-rival Edmonton Eskimos; and Grey Cup.

""That (Labour Day game) is just ingrained in my DNA,"" he said with a chuckle. ""The Labour Day Classic is so quintessential Alberta, it's wonderful.

""There's something so Canadian about (the Grey Cup), it's 40 below in a blizzard and the guys are out on the field. It's just wild.""

While Bogoch appreciates sport isn't a priority for some, he said it can definitely provide a boost for others during a pandemic.

""When we step back and think about what's been happening the last six months and especially since our lockdown in March and throughout our gradual reopening, people have taken a tremendous hit,"" he said. ""We've taken financial hits . . . we've taken emotional and psychological hits by staying at home.

""While some people might say (sport) isn't an essential service and they're correct, I think we can also say professional and amateur sports and other forms of entertainment like the arts are extremely important to the psychological and emotional well-being of our society. This may help provide some intangible benefits as well.""

Mercifully, Bogoch sees light at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic tunnel.

""I think we'll gradually see this start to wind down as vaccines are developed and rolled out globally,"" he said. ""In the best-case scenario it could be as early as late 2020 . . . but more realistically needles will start going into arms in 2021.

""I think the key word there is globally because if there's an infection in one part of the world, there's a problem in all parts of the world. This thing is pretty contagious and people are mobile so we need this vaccine deployed on a global level.""

The economic and fiscal ""snapshot"" from the government today lays out the Liberals' belief that there will be a slow return to a new normal, with unemployment high and economic growth low through to at least the end of 2021.

article continues below

Even though the government believes the worst of the economic harm from the pandemic is behind the country, the document says a recovery can't begin in earnest until an effective vaccine or treatment becomes widely available.

Things could, however, get worse under two alternative scenarios the Finance Department lays out.

Should prolonged shutdowns stay in place, or restrictions not fully roll back, a return to normal activity for households and businesses will be uneven and slower than hoped for, leading to a more pronounced drop in economic output than is already expected.

And should the country be hit with a second wave of the novel coronavirus during the annual flu season, the ensuing lockdowns would cause what the Finance Department describes as a ""deeper and longer-lasting negative impact on the economy.""

The Liberals have repeatedly promised to use the federal treasury as a financial shield between Canadians and irreparable harm, and the cost of that promise is now at $231.9 billion in direct spending and a deficit comparable only to those seen in the Second World War.

Whatever the costs, they're worth it, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a news conference Wednesday morning, before the snapshot was released.

""As we measure the cost of helping Canadians, we shouldn't forget that the cost of doing nothing would have been far more,"" Trudeau said, insisting that this is not the time for belt-tightening or austerity.

The document tries to make that case, saying that the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which had paid out $53.5 billion in benefits as of late June, has covered Canadians' estimated $44.6 billion in lost labour income through the first half of the year.

The $2,000-a-month benefit is estimated to have covered the monthly housing, food, phone and internet costs for the bottom and middle thirds of households, according to Finance Department calculations.

Historically low interest rates mean all the hundreds of billions in borrowing comes with ""manageable"" costs, Trudeau said, and the alternative would be for individuals and households to load up with debt themselves to cope with months of no or little work.

Adding to the deficit is a $37.3 billion boost to the federal wage subsidy program to bring its budget to $82.3 billion, signalling an expansion and coming changes to the benefit that covers up to 75 per cent of wages to a maximum of $847 a week for eligible companies.

The Liberals expect more workers to move onto the wage subsidy and off the Canada Emergency Response Benefit as that $80-billion program winds down.

Those who fall through the COVID-19 financial safety net are expected to be caught by the employment insurance system that has been largely dormant since the CERB replaced it in late March.

Government officials admit there will still need to be policy changes to the EI system to help some self-employed workers qualify, and capture EI-eligible workers who, due to the pandemic, haven't been able to work the necessary qualifying hours.

For this calendar year, the government expects the unemployment rate to hit 9.8 per cent, dropping to 7.8 per cent next year based on forecasts by 13 private sector economists.

Although that's a bump from the record-high unemployment rate of 13.7 per cent in May for a labour force of just over 19 million, it is still almost double the record low of 5.5 per cent pre-pandemic.

The document doesn't contain the five-year forecast traditionally part of federal budgets owing to the uncertain path the pandemic will take and the state of the economy beyond that.

""Even when the pandemic is over, lasting consequences may cast a long-term shadow over economic developments, for example via more indebted businesses and households, persistent unemployment and substantial structural changes in the economy that have been accelerated through the crisis,"" the government's update says.

""In the coming months and as needed the government will announce measures to support the recovery.""

Opposition parties had wanted Morneau to provide a road map for reshaping emergency aid measures that are set to expire in the fall and keeping spending and deficits under control.

In his own morning news conference, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the Liberals mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic by being slow to close borders and by instituting too-rigid emergency aid programs.

Canada can't afford for the Liberals to mishandle the economy as well, he said, by keeping benefits in place that remove incentives to go back to work while the novel coronavirus remains a risk.

""Liberals put all their faith in government, Conservatives put our faith in people,"" Scheer said.

He said the Liberals should take up a Conservative proposal to offer a ""back to work bonus"" and send more money to the federal auditor general so her office can study the government's spending more closely.

Next week, the Bank of Canada is to again update its forecasts when it releases a monetary policy report along with a scheduled interest-rate announcement.

Last month, the central bank said it expected a decline between 10 and 20 per cent in the second quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. That is an improvement from the 15-to-30-per-cent drop in the quarter highlighted in the bank's worst-case scenario in April.

There were no new deaths and there remain 16 people in hospital, with four of those in intensive care units.

That makes 2,990 people who have tested positive for the virus that has caused a global pandemic since COVID-19 first appeared in B.C. in late January.

Of those, 183 people have died, 2,645 people have recovered and 162 people are still battling the disease. Most infected patients are self-isolating at home.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,013 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,576 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and the outbreak at Tabor Home has now been declared over,"" B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement on July 7.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Dix and Henry said.

""There has been a new community exposure event at Hotel Belmont bar and nightclub in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the premises on June 27 and June 29.""

B.C. is estimated to have a population of about 5,190,000 people so it has so far had about one case of COVID-19 for every 1,735 residents, or 0.576 people per 1,000 residents. That compares with Washington State's estimated population of 7,615,000 people and 36,970 cases, for about one case of COVID-19 for every 206 people, or 4.85 people per 1,000 residents.

B.C.'s death rate, however, at more than 6.1%, is slightly higher than other jurisdictions.

Washington State, with 1,384 deaths, has a 3.7% death rate for COVID-19 patients.

Johns Hopkins University's Centre for Systems Science and Engineering has recorded 11,712,663 COVID-19 cases and 540,582 deaths globally, for a death rate of slightly more than 4.6%.

The record high of 10,028 new cases in Texas served as another alarming new measure of the swift resurgence of COVID-19 nationwide and the failures of the country’s response. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas aggressively began one of America’s fastest reopenings in May but has begun reversing course in recent weeks, ordering bars closed and mandating face coverings.

article continues below

New York and Florida are the only other states to record more than 10,000 new cases in a single day. New York hit that grim total back in April, when New York City hospitals were overwhelmed and hundreds of people were dying every day. Florida topped 10,000 confirmed cases last week.

The record mark in Texas partly reflects a lag in testing results from the Fourth of July weekend, when newly reported cases were far below what Texas has seen in recent weeks. But Abbott said the numbers should still be ""an alarm bell for everybody"" who is skeptical about whether the virus is a threat.

""We have rapid spread of COVID-19 in the state of Texas right now,"" Abbott told San Antonio television station KENS.

Later in the interview, Abbott was noncommittal about whether he would attend his own party's convention next week in Houston, which the Texas GOP has remained bent on holding even as the mayor, doctors and businesses pressure the party to cancel. Houston has emerged as one of the nation's hot zones in the pandemic. However, Republican activists, some of whom have called the fears overblown, have resolved to press forward with the indoor three-day convention.

Texas surged past 8,000 statewide hospitalizations for the first time over the long holiday weekend — a more than quadruple increase on the past month. On Tuesday, the number of hospitalizations soared past 9,000. Texas also set a new high for deaths in a single day with 60.

Mayors in some of the biggest cities in the state and U.S. — including Austin, San Antonio and Houston — have warned that hospitals could soon become overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. Along the Texas-Mexico border, some cities imposed curfew orders in hopes of cutting down on large parties or social gatherings as cases have skyrocketed.

""Many of us are running at capacity and have created new wards,"" said Todd Mann, the chief executive officer at McAllen Medical Center, which on Tuesday had more than 130 coronavirus patients taking up more than half of the facility's beds. ""The physical space is obviously limited, and most of the hospitals are running out of that pretty quickly.""

The record count was reported on a day that also saw the State Fair of Texas cancelled for the the first time since World War II. Fair organizers said the event, which draws more than a million visitors to Dallas each fall, was not feasible during the pandemic.

It also came as President Donald Trump leaned on governors to reopen schools this fall, arguing that some are keeping schools closed not because of the risks from the coronavirus pandemic but for political reasons. Texas education officials announced Tuesday that face coverings will be mandatory for students older than 10 years old and that school districts must offer on-campus learning to any family that wants their child in a classroom.

Deaths remain lower in Texas compared to other big states. As of Tuesday, Texas has confirmed that at least 2,715 people have died due to COVID-19. But fatalities have climbed in recent days, and in addition to an alarming acceleration in new cases in Texas, the seven-day infection rate has climbed to 13.5%.

The number of infections is likely far higher because many people haven't been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick.

Two separate photos of the bare-faced party leader sitting comfortably in a waiting area circulated online but his office says he was wearing a mask for his trip.

A spokesperson said the photos must have been taken after he doffed the covering to take a call but before he put it back on.

Toronto's Pearson airport currently has a policy that masks must be worn at all times to curb the spread of COVID-19, with limited exceptions that include being at a food or beverage service location.

The photos shows Scheer in the lounge with several others, and while they are seated spaced apart, none is wearing a mask.

In April, Scheer was criticized for bringing his family on a government flight back to Ottawa for a House of Commons sitting, reducing the ability for the other two MPs on board to keep a distance from the Scheers.

He and other party leaders have been wearing masks around Parliament Hill. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also wears them during photo ops.

Scheer is the waning days of his leadership. The ballots to select his replacement go in the mail in the coming days and a new leader will be elected in late August.

Up to 90 centres across the country will gradually reopen in July, starting with 14 on Wednesday. Further openings are to be guided by public health advice as well as how many Canadians each centre serves.

The government has spent the past few weeks upgrading the centres to put up clear barriers at counters, signs to encourage physical distancing and reduce seating in waiting areas.

Personal protective equipment will also be provided to staff at centres that reopen.

Face masks will be offered to people visiting centres in provinces or municipalities that have mandated their use in indoor public spaces.

Anyone going to a centre that doesn't fall under any such provincial or municipal requirement will be encouraged to wear a masks and use hand-sanitizer.

While the newly reopened centres will handle queries for social insurance numbers, employment insurance and the Canada Pension Plan among others, the government says passport and biometrics services won't be available at first.

Days after public health authorities closed businesses and ordered workers to stay home to slow the spread of COVID-19, the Liberals closed the sprawling network of Service Canada centres.

Some of the offices, such as one tucked inside Ottawa's city hall, had already started to close before the official announcement in March as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased and workers were needed elsewhere, or resisted going in.

The government says an online Service Canada portal opened in response to the closures has seen more than 700,000 requests. That's about half the number of in-person visits Service Canada locations would see in the same period in normal times.

In a release, the government is still urging Canadians to use online services wherever possible, including to book appointments online for in-person help.

The network of 318 Service Canada centres, along with almost 250 more outreach centres, received about 8.4 million visits during the 12-month period between April 2018 and March 2019. The figure, noted in a recently posted evaluation of federal services, included over 1.9 million people walking in to use a self-service kiosk.

Central 1 says it expects home sales to recover marginally in 2020 and 2021 after tumbling by 55 per cent between mid-March and April.

article continues below

Deputy chief economist Brian Yu says despite values plunging to levels not seen since the early 1980s, home prices have stayed firm because fewer properties were available for sale.

He predicts median prices could rebound to about $710,000 before slipping to around $540,000 late this year or early in 2021.

Yu says unemployment, business and health concerns will further weaken the market, while population growth, which has traditionally propped up the sector in B.C., will slow to a trickle next year, dampening sales.

He says a second wave of COVID-19 has the potential to shave home prices by 15 per cent as more owners already hit by the pandemic's first wave are forced to sell during a second downturn.

The report released Tuesday notes positive developments as B.C. enters the third phase of its recovery plan including restarts in the accommodation, spa, film and television industries.

Vacancy rates could also climb as high as three per cent over the next year, writes Yu, ""providing an opportune time for renters to negotiate rental rates before the market tightens up again.""

Housing starts are forecast to slump 33 per cent in 2020 and remain flat in 2021, which ""set the stage for a housing supply shortage in coming years,"" the report says.

The timing of a second wave and its impact on the economy would draw out the effect on the housing market, potentially carrying into 2022, it says.

Summer is officially here, with sunny weather, full ferries, and a few statutory holidays thrown in for good measure. As much as it feels like the perfect time to relax and have fun, please continue taking every measure to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak on the Coast. We don’t have to look very far south to see what can happen if we are not careful, and we need to keep working together to keep our community safe.

While there have been some welcome changes with Phase 3 of our provincial Restart Plan, it is important to remember that all of the other personal and business recommendations from Phase 2 remain in place. Phase 3 is not a return to normal and we should all continue to act as though COVID-19 is still here.

This means that businesses should be following Public Health and Worksafe BC guidelines to ensure the safety of employees and customers. This includes limiting the number of people on premises at any one time, ensuring adequate spacing, and the use of masks and barriers when physical spacing is not possible. Please respect our businesses who are doing their very best to ensure the safety of everyone who enters.

In our local health-care facilities, visitors are allowed, but are restricted to essential visits only. For the hospital, each patient may have one visitor at a time for a maximum of two hours per visitor. For our long-term care facilities, residents may have one designated person who is able to visit. Virtual visits are allowed at all facilities, and tablets are available for residents and patients who do not have access otherwise.

For individuals, our recommendations remain the same:

• Maintain physical distancing with people outside of your household (or your very limited family/friend bubble), and wear a mask whenever you can’t maintain a distance of at least two metres.

• Wash your hands frequently, especially after touching high contact surfaces.

Do not touch your face unless you have just washed your hands, and make sure you wash your hands after touching your face.

• Avoid large groups if you can, especially indoors. If you do meet up with others, please meet up outside whenever possible and maintain physical distancing.

• Exercise extra caution if you are older and have high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease or other significant health issues.

If you do develop new cold or flu symptoms (no matter how mild), please stay home and self-isolate until you have been assessed. Do not go to work. Do not go shopping. Do not meet up with others. Do call your family doctor or the Respiratory Assessment Clinic (Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) to arrange for further assessment and testing, if indicated. The Respiratory Assessment Clinic can be reached by phone or text at 604-740-1252 or by email at coastrespclinic@gmail.com.

We continue to test everyone with possible COVID-19 symptoms, so please do not hesitate to call if you become ill. If you have more severe symptoms and believe you may need to be admitted to hospital, please go to the Sechelt Hospital Emergency Department. If you need an ambulance, please call 911. The Emergency Department is open and safe for anyone with a medical emergency.

With respect to non-emergent non-COVID-19 health issues, our local medical clinics remain open Monday to Friday, with virtual and in-person walk-in services available through the Gibsons Medical Clinic from Monday to Saturday. Please note that all of our family medicine clinics are currently booking people without a local family doctor.

In order to provide as safe an environment as possible for both patients and staff, the majority of medical care will continue to be provided virtually. This is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. If you have a medical issue that requires a physical assessment, an in-person appointment will be arranged.

Please check the Coast Reporter and The Local Weekly for periodic updates on COVID-19 in our community. As local parks, programs and facilities open up, please visit the SCRD, the Town of Gibsons, and the District of Sechelt websites for updates.

But just three weeks before Green and her family were set to fly from Edmonton to Sydney, N.S., on July 17, WestJet announced it was ending its policy of leaving the middle seats on its flights empty.

article continues below

""I was devastated,"" Green said, noting her family spends every summer in Nova Scotia with her 93-year-old grandmother who is suffering from severe dementia and another family member with an incurable form of cancer.

""We all knew it could very well be the last summer we would spend with them.""

When Green called WestJet to see if any accommodations could be made, she told the company she has a heart condition that puts her in the high-risk category for COVID-19.

Despite her pleas, Green said the airline told her it was unable to make any special accommodations, nor would it allow her to change the date of the flight to before July 1, when the rules were relaxed, without paying a fee.

And Green's not alone: as provinces begin to relax domestic travel restrictions, the cessation of physical distancing rules by two of Canada's biggest airlines — WestJet and Air Canada — is causing frustration and grief among some passengers.

Gabor Lukacs, head of the advocacy group Air Passenger Rights Canada, said he has fielded countless complaints from passengers during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which are related to the same issues: airlines refusing to offer refunds or accommodations amid the abolition of physical distancing rules.

While he acknowledges the effort to fill seats is due to airlines attempting to recoup billions in lost revenue, Lukacs argues the companies risk deterring customers from flying at all.

""The question is: do we allow economic considerations to override public health? We don't allow supermarkets to sell spoiled meat because it's cheaper. Are we going to allow doctors to skip disinfecting their tools to save the cost?""

There's some evidence he's right: a new poll conducted by Leger and the Association of Canadian Studies found 72 per cent of respondents say they are not comfortable flying now that Air Canada and WestJet have culled their seat distancing policies.

Only 22 per cent said they would be OK with flying under the newly relaxed rules.

In response to criticisms, WestJet forwarded The Canadian Press a statement from a July 3 blog post regarding changes to its seat distancing policy.

""The blocked middle seat was introduced at the beginning of the pandemic before the myriad of safety measures were put in place and mandated on board,"" the statement reads.

""Seat distancing was never intended to be in place permanently or throughout the pandemic.""

The post notes a number of measures WestJet has taken to help stop the spread of COVID-19 on its flights, including mandatory masking, pre-boarding questionnaires for all passengers, temperature screening, thorough cleaning of aircraft between flights, and the restriction of in-flight dining services.

However, the company has also denied it's putting passengers and staff at risk by filling flights up, pointing to other safety measures as mitigating the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Air Canada provided a similar statement, acknowledging the inconvenience the change may have caused to customers.

""While we would all like a single measure that reduces risk, we are left to use a combination of approaches to mitigate risk as far as practical,"" the airline said.

Yet some passengers report first-hand experiences in which masking protocols were not followed.

Maureen Isabel Green, 31, flew from Vancouver to Fredericton three weeks ago with Air Canada to visit her family, and said she was shocked by the lax use of masks by both airport employees and the passengers on her two connecting flights.

""I just think of all the people who are getting on a flight and risking their life, or risking the life of the people they're going to visit, because some people don't want to wear a mask for a few hours,"" she said.

Green, who is a health-care worker, said there were numerous instances on her flight from Vancouver to Montreal where a group of young, male passengers took off their masks when flight attendants were not present.

While at the Montreal airport, Green said a man was able to board a flight without wearing a mask, simply by telling attendants he had a medical condition that prevented him from doing so.

Air travel has been at the centre of several headline-grabbing incidents throughout the pandemic — particularly since travel restrictions have been eased in some regions.

On July 2, health authorities in B.C. warned the passengers of four separate flights that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Just a day before — on the exact day the airlines ended their social distancing policies — the Nova Scotia Health Authority warned passengers of a Toronto-to-Halifax WestJet flight from the previous week that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

And on Sunday, a Halifax man reportedly walked off of a St. John's-bound flight after learning he was the only passenger travelling within the so-called ""Atlantic bubble,"" sparking discussion about the effectiveness of airlines' COVID-prevention policies.

The YMCA Canada, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada and the Royal Canadian Legion are among those that say they are facing severe financial difficulties and been forced to permanently close some locations even as demand for their services has increased.

article continues below

A YMCA facility permanently closed its doors in Yarmouth, N.S., because of the pandemic while the Boys and Girls Clubs shuttered its operations in Edson, Alta. The legion has seen three halls close for good in Ontario and one in New Brunswick.

While the fear is those are just the beginning, the government is also being warned that failing to help now could cost more in the long run as organizations that provide child care, emergency food support and other social services disappear.

""The problem is the bill will come due later,"" said Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada president Owen Charters. ""Because as these organizations disappear, the social safety net becomes a tax burden where the government needs to step in and provide those services directly.""

The sector began to bang the drums with alarm at the end of March as Canadians started to realize the pandemic would last longer than a couple of weeks and donations and other sources of income such as the provision of child care started to dry up.

Dozens of charities signed a letter on March 25 asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government for financial aid to prevent ""irreparable damage,"" particularly at a time when more people needed their services.

Ottawa has since included the sector in some of its COVID-19 supports such as wage-subsidy and rent-deferral programs. It also created a $350-million fund for organizations to provide emergency assistance to Canadians during the pandemic.

While welcome, those interviewed say the already-announced federal programs and funding fall far short.

""What we need is direct supports to make sure Ys can survive the crisis,"" YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale said. ""There is a real need for sector stabilization. It's not just YMCAs in this country. It is Boys and Girls Clubs, the United Way. So many entities out there require support.""

The government has been told as much numerous times, with letters written and phone calls made. Yet those interviewed say there has yet to be a real response. That silence has sparked concern and frustration.

""We sent off two letters,"" said Royal Canadian Legion dominion president Tom Irvine. ""There was no acknowledgment of receiving the letters or nothing. So I'm pretty discouraged at this time, but still hopeful. This is a Canadian institution and if we don't do something, we could lose it.""

Social Development Minister Ahmed Hussen's spokeswoman Jessica Eritou on Tuesday praised the work of the charitable and non-profit sector and touted the $350-million emergency fund, which organizations say does not address the core of their concerns.

""We are continuing to look at ways to work with charities and non-profits supporting Canadians during the crisis,"" she added.

""We continue discussions with organizations to help support the important work they're doing in communities across the country and we will keep looking for the most effective ways to help Canadians during this unprecedented crisis.""

Cardus, a charity that does research on the non-profit sector, released a paper on Tuesday urging the federal government to start matching donations from Canadians to different organizations using money set aside to cover the costs of a tax credit for Canadians who donate.

But Dinsdale and Charters said matching programs will still leave many organizations struggling, and that the only real solution is direct federal support to help the sector weather the pandemic and continue providing essential services.

A lack of safe places for children to be while their parents work is an obstacle to economic recovery, economists have warned, particularly for women.

""While the federal government's been focused on macro-economic approaches like the wage subsidy, like CERB and other initiatives, they have ignored this sector,"" said Dinsdale, whose organization runs child-care centres across the country.

""And they've ignored this sector at the risk of not having the most critical social services available to Canadians as the economy reopens.""

The figure is the upper range of the scenarios the budget watchdog was asked to research as part of a report released Tuesday morning as policy-makers consider how to shape emergency supports set to expire in the fall.

article continues below

Planned federal spending to date on pandemic-related aid now tops about $174 billion, in a range of programs meant to provide a financial floor for individuals and businesses.

The idea of giving a government-guaranteed basic income to Canadians has gained steam as millions have watched their jobs or earnings evaporate in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau and other senior cabinet ministers have repeatedly been asked by senators and MPs about the concept. Advocates argue that it would be an expansion of the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit for workers who saw their incomes crash.

The CERB and a $45-billion wage-subsidy program are set to expire in October.

Providing six months of a basic income starting that month could cost between $47.5 billion and $98.1 billion, depending on how much of the benefit is clawed back from people whose other incomes increase.

Budget officer Yves Giroux's report says the average benefit to Canadians aged 18 to 64 would range between $4,500 and $4,800, with the number of recipients depending on the phase-out rate.

Sen. Yuen Pau Woo, who asked for the costing, said a basic-income program could fill in the gaps in Canada's social safety nets, a patchwork largely run by provinces, that have been exposed by the pandemic.

""It's a huge undertaking to launch a basic income for the whole country on a permanent basis. The costs are extremely high and the political resistance is likely to be fierce, but we are in a period where it is likely we will have to spend large sums of money on income support going into the balance of 2020 and into 2021,"" Woo said in a telephone interview.

""The question to my mind is how we spend it, and in what form.""

A basic income means different things to different people, but it is usually viewed as a no-strings-attached benefit that governments provide to citizens instead of various targeted social benefits.

Also known as a guaranteed minimum income, it can be delivered as a universal payment, or as a means-tested benefit that declines as a recipient's other income rises.

Giroux's report says the government could repeal $15 billion in tax measures to offset the overall cost of a basic-income program, which Woo added would likely have to wrap in existing measures to avoid duplication.

The overall cost of the program might be higher than the budget office estimates. The PBO's estimates rely on some Statistics Canada income data that doesn't include people living in the northern territories or in First Nations, or some military members.

Nor can the figures simply be doubled to determine a full year's cost because that might overstate the financial impact. The economy appears to be bouncing back slowly from a bottoming-out in April, and the cost of the program would depend on how many employees are rehired or find new jobs.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents small businesses nationwide, said Tuesday that about one-third of members responding to a survey reported being back at full staffing levels, but suggested many believe it will take six months to get back to normal profitability.

Statistics Canada is to release June's jobs report on Friday.

Projections released Tuesday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimate Canada's unemployment rate at 11 per cent for the second quarter of the year.

The 37-member international body predicted the national unemployment rate would decline to 7.7 per cent by the end of the year, or to 8.4 per cent should a second wave of the novel coronavirus force renewed lockdowns.

NDP finance critic Peter Julian said Tuesday that the uncertain economic path ahead requires the Liberals to say how the government plans to reshape emergency aid in Wednesday's fiscal update.

He said a more universal benefit, which the NDP has pushed, would have helped more people and cost less had the Liberals used it from the start.

""It makes more sense to make sure that everybody who needs the benefit can actually get it than the government's approach,"" Julian said.

The Liberals have said the update on Wednesday will provide an economic outlook, an accounting of spending to date and projections for the remainder of the fiscal year, including the expected deficit. The PBO and others estimate that to be at least $250 billion.

Seventy-two per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they're not comfortable flying since a decision by some airlines to relax their own in-flight physical distancing requirements.

article continues below

As of July 1, Air Canada and WestJet both ended policies blocking the sale of adjacent seats.

The measure was seen to align with a guidance document for the aviation industry issued by Transport Canada in April to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Among other things, the department had suggested passengers should be widely spaced when possible, though they did not make it mandatory.

Airlines, however, are required to make passengers and air crews wear masks.

Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said they're comfortable getting aboard with no in-flight physical distancing and a requirement to wear masks.

There's more to it to keep flights safe, WestJet said in a statement last week after critics attacked its plan.

""What makes an airplane, and the entire journey, safe is the layers of enhanced cleaning, the wearing of masks and the hospital-grade HEPA filters that remove 99.999 per cent of all airborne particles,"" the airline said.

""The hygiene standards we have now are world-class and backed by industry experts.""

Critics have also previously pounced on the airlines for another move: refusing to fully refund tickets for flights cancelled due to the pandemic.

Thousands of people have beseeched Transport Minister Marc Garneau to compel airlines to issue refunds, but he has refused, arguing that mandating reimbursements from a sector that's lost more than 90 per cent of its revenue would cripple the industry.

But 72 per cent of those polled say they totally oppose his decision.

In lieu of refunds, the airlines have offered vouchers but the poll suggests that it may take a while before people will rebook previously cancelled trips: 85 per cent of those surveyed told pollsters they have no plans to travel outside the country by the end of the year.

The survey polled 1,517 people and can't be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

Pollsters were in the field between July 3 and 5, a historically popular few days for Canadians and Americans to be on the move between the two countries, given the July 1 Canada Day holiday and the U.S.'s July 4 Independence Day.

But the border remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the majority of Canadians surveyed said they feel it needs to stay that way. The current mutual closure agreement is due to expire July 21.

Of Canadians polled, 86 per cent said they totally disagreed with re-opening the border at the end of July, allowing Americans back into the country.

Americans seem more eager both to head north and to welcome Canadians south; 50 per cent agreed the border should re-open and 36 per cent disagreed.

The potential for cross-border transmission of the virus has been a key factor in the decision to keep the border closed. Currently, rates of COVID-19 infection in the U.S. continue to climb, while in Canada the curve appears to be on a downward trajectory nearly everywhere.

Still, the survey suggests Canadians don't feel they are out of the woods. Thirty-nine per cent believe the worst is yet to come, while 35 per cent believe the worst of the crisis has passed.

In the U.S., 42 per cent of those surveyed felt the darkest days are ahead, 25 per cent believe the U.S. is in the middle of the worst part now while 21 per cent think that's already passed.

The spike in deaths includes one death in June but which only recently was confirmed to be a result of the COVID-19 virus, Henry said.

article continues below

""To lose six people, all in long-term care, over the last three days is a source of enormous grief,"" said BC Health Minister Adrian Dix.

There have been no new outbreaks in B.C. since Friday. There were 31 new confirmed cases since Friday, bringing the total number of cases to 2,978. Of that number, 2,629 people have recovered, leaving 166 active cases in B.C.

There are currently three long-term care facilities in B.C. with active cases of COVID-19, and one acute care facility.

Responding to a spike in cases in Seattle, and the question of whether public demonstrations may have contributed to the uptick, Henry was asked whether any cases in B.C. have been traced to large anti-racism public protests that took place in Vancouver in June. She said it appears those large gatherings did not result in any spread of the virus.

""Currently, we do not have any cases that have been associated with the protests that took place,"" Henry said. ""In talking with my colleagues in the U.S., they also have not seen surges related to those activities.""

The fact the protests were held outside may be one of the factors that limited the potential spread of the virus.

Henry, health authorities and long term care operators have been working together to relax the restrictions on visitations in long term care homes. Given the recent spike in deaths, Henry was asked if that did not raise concerns about reintroducing the virus into care homes.

She conceded that, once the virus is in a care home, the potential for it to kill elderly people is high.

""The good news is that we have reduced the amount of transmission in our community so much so that we have very people in hospital,"" she said. ""We have very few people who are transmitting in our community, and that's why we feel we're at that balance where we need to allow more people to go into long-term care.""

Here are today’s COVID-19 numbers for Monday, July 6, with numbers from Friday July 3, the last reporting period, in brackets:

New cases: 31 (13)

The league and its union announced Monday the two sides have hammered out a tentative deal on the return-to-play protocol as well as a memorandum of understanding on a four-year extension of the current collective bargaining agreement.

article continues below

The NHL board of governors, the NHLPA's executive board and full membership must now ratify the documents, which are tied together, in three separate votes. If the proposals get the green light, training camps would begin July 13, with the 24 teams set to resume heading to the two Canadian hub cities on July 26. Competitive game action would then commence Aug. 1.

The league has yet to announce the two hubs for its return-to-play plan this summer, but Toronto and Edmonton are the destinations, a person with direct knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the league and the NHLPA have not released this information. The person said the league is in part being cautious and allowing itself flexibility in the event of potential spikes in COVID-19 infections in not yet determining which cities will host the conference finals and Stanley Cup final.

Hashed out in the shadow of unprecedented economic conditions brought on by COVID-19 — and viewed as crucial for a resumption of play — the proposed CBA would bring at least 14 consecutive years of NHL-NHLPA harmony after lockouts wiped out the 2004-05 season, and cut the 1994-95 and 2012-13 campaigns to 48 games.

While details of the CBA, which would last through the 2025-26 season, weren't made public Monday, it's believed the salary cap, escrow payments from players to owners, and Olympic participation all figure prominently. Escrow, which guarantees a 50-50 split of hockey-related revenues, was a thorny issue for players before the pandemic significantly impacted the league's bottom line when the schedule was suspended March 12.

Getting back to the Olympics has also been a priority for players. The NHL, which would still have to negotiate with the International Olympic Committee, skipped the 2018 Winter Games after participating in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The league and players unveiled the 24-team format for a resumption of play in late May.

The plan to resuscitate the season calls for players to be segregated from the general population in tightly-controlled ""bubbles"" — games will be played without fans — in hopes of keeping the coronavirus at bay. The NHL, which will test everyone inside the bubble daily, has consistently maintained one or more positive results wouldn't necessarily derail the restart.

The NHL and the NHLPA outlined extensive health and safety measures for training camps and resumption of play Monday — referred to as Phase 3 and Phase 4, respectively, of its return-to-play plan — in two documents totalling 47 pages.

Teams will be allowed to bring 52 personnel, with no more than 31 players, to its hub. Every person in the bubble will be subject to daily testing, including players, staff, hotel workers, food service employees and bus drivers. Every team member/player inside the bubble will be expected to remain there except in specific extenuating circumstances, including medical attention, the birth of a child or a death in the family.

Anyone returning to the bubble will be subject to a minimum four-day quarantine with daily nasal swab tests for COVID-19.

While the league is encouraging physical distancing at all times, players won't be required to wear masks when exercising or on the ice. The same goes for coaches behind the bench and off-ice officials. Masks are required to be worn inside the bubble by any individual not in their hotel room.

The NHL and NHLPA have the ability to delay, postpone, move or cancel games in the event there's a ""risk to player health and safety"" and/or a chance that ""the integrity of the competition"" is in jeopardy, including ""an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.""

There is not, however, any specifics as to what would constitute ""an uncontrolled outbreak.""

Individuals leaving the bubble without permission may be subject to consequences up to and including removal from Phase 4. Teams could also be hit with steep punishments, including fines and/or loss of draft choices.

Players are allowed to opt out of Phase 3 and Phase 4 without penalty, but have to notify their team this week.

Vancouver, Las Vegas, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis/St. Paul were the other cities originally in the running to be hubs.

The NHL is looking to restart its season with a blueprint that includes eight best-of-five qualifying round series before pivoting to the typical 16-team playoffs. It's hoped the Stanley Cup, which has been awarded all but twice since 1893, will be handed out sometime in the fall.

Las Vegas was viewed as a hub front-runner because its massive hotel complexes could be more-easily secured in a bubble scenario until a recent surge in COVID-19 cases across large swaths of the United States — the death toll there currently stands at more than 130,000 people — likely made the destination far less appealing.

But despite Monday's good news, there remain difficult waters to navigate.

The league and NHLPA will not quarantine players during training camp, but instead ask they stay home when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and July 6 during voluntary workouts as part of Phase 2 protocols, 23 results — in the neighbourhood of six per cent — came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in Phase 2.

The Tampa Bay Lightning closed their practice facility last month after three players and additional staff members tested positive for COVID-19. Of the 24 teams poised to resume play, 18 are located in the U.S., including current virus hot spots like Florida, Texas and Arizona.

Four clubs previously confirmed 10 positive tests in the spring, with five coming from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche, and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins.

As travel editor at the Vancouver Courier newspaper, vice-chair of the B.C. branch of the Travel Media Association of Canada, and a member of the Society of American Travel Writers, travel is a big part of my life, which meant I already had the contacts in place to get started.

Now with some destinations looking to slowly reopen, and, in an effort to catch a glimpse of future travel trends, I’m continuing to reach out to travel experts and tourism bureaus across Canada and the globe for answers to five similar questions.

And while no one can predict the future, all are hopeful travel will soon resume. But, how exactly that will look is anyone’s guess.

If you are part of a destination management organization or represent a property and want to share your thoughts, please drop me a line at writersblock5@hotmail.com.

Five questions with Lessner Gomez, director, Cuba Tourist Board, Toronto office.

How did COVID-19 impact tourism in Cuba?

Like other tourist destinations around the world, Cuba closed to international travel because of the Corona Virus. Cuba is now ready to slowly open to visitors.

In order to control and isolate any possible infection, Cuba has reopened its doors in Cayo Largo, Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, Cayo Santa María and Cayo Cruz effective July 1.

Cuba is beginning to reopen to tourism. Who are the first international visitors Cuba will be expecting?

Cuba is looking forward to welcoming travellers from Canada and Europe. We have enjoyed a special relationship with Canada for over forty years.

We look forward to welcoming Canada back to our beautiful beaches.

How important are Canadians to tourism in Cuba?

Historically Canada has always been the biggest international inbound market for Cuba.

What does the future hold for Cuba and are there any trends we can look forward to?

As with the rest of the world, the future is hard to predict, but we are very positive.

Cuba enjoys a world class health system with particular expertise in the treatment of diseases of the lungs. In fact, throughout this pandemic we have offered medical support to countries around the world.

We believe we can offer tourists from Canada the confidence to return to our wonderful destinations and we look forward to welcoming them.

We believe that by opening gradually, tourist will feel comfortable with our planning and slowly we can begin to open other parts of our country.

What enhanced safety measures have been put in place to ensure visitors to resorts, hotels and attractions will be safe?

Over the past few months, the Cuban government has focused its efforts on the battle against the pandemic.

During this time, government officials took steps to improve all hotels and tourism infrastructure. Hygiene and sanitary protocols were put in place in order to ensure the safety of the Cuban people and its international visitors, as tourism activities are reactivated.

Hygiene and sanitary protocols will be practiced from the first phase, for example:

In order to operate, tourist facilities must obtain government certification called: Most hygienic and safest tourism (T + HS).

Workers with respiratory symptoms will not be allowed on resort premises and anyone with symptoms will be immediately directed to a health center.

International tourist circulation will only take place at the cayos (islands) where tourists enjoy their holidays.

Excursions will be offered only at the cayos for the international market.

The nautical activities and operations at international marinas of tourist centers approved for international tourism are reactivated.

As approved by the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, in the second phase, foreign tourists will undergo the PCR test free of charge upon their arrival in the country.

Bonus question

Where do Americans fit into the scheme of things in Cuba right now?

There are no changes on the Cuba-US relations and related travel restrictions.

The ferry company announced July 3 that starting on July 10 two round trips would be added to the schedule on Fridays and Sundays – a 4:20 and 6:40 p.m. departure from Langdale and a 3:15 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. departure from Horseshoe Bay.

article continues below

BC Ferries is also adding more trips on other busy routes, including Horseshoe Bay-Nanaimo.

The addition of more sailings comes as local governments are calling for a return to a full summer schedule and travellers continue to voice frustration online.

In a lengthy post on her Facebook page July 3, Sechelt Mayor Darnleda Siegers asked residents upset with the current level of service, short-notice schedule changes, and problems rebooking reservations to “cut [BC Ferries] some slack.”

“Behind the glitches and the mistakes are humans just like you and I and they are trying as best they can,” she wrote.

But Siegers is also urging Coasters to lobby the province and the federal government for more financial support for BC Ferries.

“BC Ferries needs financial assistance from the provincial and federal government as they are using their capital funds, previously earmarked for the Langdale ferry upgrade and our second ship and other capital expenditures, to cover off their operating costs,” said Siegers.

Siegers also called the $180,000 the provincial government has already committed to keep sailings from being cut on minor routes, including Earls Cove-Saltery Bay, “a drop in the bucket.”

“There is some money earmarked for B.C. from the federal government that will be provided within the next while,” she said. “I’d like to see some of it go to BC Ferries.”

The money Siegers is referring to is part of a $14-billion “safe restart agreement” between Ottawa and the provinces.

West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country MP Patrick Weiler has also suggested that agreement could be the source of funding to backstop BC Ferries against the financial losses caused by the sudden drop in ridership in the early phase of the pandemic.

“I believe that one of the areas that they want to make sure that funding is going to go towards is transit, which has been very much hit hard by the pandemic similar to BC Ferries, which could also be an option for that funding,” Weiler said during a June 23 update for the Sechelt and District Chamber of Commerce.

In response to Coast Reporter’s inquiry to the premier’s office about the status of the discussions on the safe restart agreement and whether some of the money would be used to support a return to normal service levels on BC Ferries, officials with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure replied that the government is “pleased to see the federal government agreeing to provide much-needed support for a variety of important provincial issues.”

“However, the number and size of programs that have been included in this list is substantial,” the email from the ministry continued. “So we look forward to seeing the details to make sure it can adequately support our recovery efforts.”

On the specific issue of BC Ferries the ministry said, “We know ferries are vital for maintaining the critical supply chain for food, goods and medicine, and for people who live and work on our coast, and continue to work with the federal government on solutions.”",[]
635,burnabynow,https://www.burnabynow.com/covid-19/public-gets-inside-access-at-gibsons-library-for-first-time-since-pandemic-hit-1.24165700,Public gets inside access at Gibsons library for first time since pandemic hit,['Sophie Woodrooffe'],,"As of July 6, people wanting books from Gibsons and District Public Library will no longer have to order them like pizza – for the first time in four months, they can walk inside and browse the shelves themselves.

“We’re looking forward to it,” said library director Heather Evans-Cullen an hour before Monday’s official 10 a.m. opening. “If I could have a ribbon cutting or slab cake, I would.”

article continues below

At least five people had already arrived before opening hours, she said. Hours of operation are now Monday to Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Doors may finally be open again but operations are far from normal. For the first two weeks, a maximum of 20 patrons will be allowed inside at any given time, “to make sure we can maintain distancing,” said Evans-Cullen.

The layout has been modified and Plexiglas installed to maintain physical barriers, returned books are quarantined for 72 hours and staff wear face shields.

The library has been closed to the public since March, when public health restrictions due to COVID-19 took effect. In late May it began offering curbside pickup and drop-off services on site, but patrons weren’t able to enter the building.

The curbside “takeout” book service is still being offered and access to digital media “contactless services” such as audiobooks, ebooks and databases, remains available.

About 65 per cent of the Town of Gibsons residents are patrons of the library, far higher than the provincial average, said Evans-Cullen. “I think it’s a special relationship this community has with this library.” With the opening, “they’re coming back home a little bit.”

And with the opening, two other important services will now be available to the public: computers and washroom facilities. “Our washrooms will be open. That’s been a huge limitation for people who may be homeless or not have sustainable housing,” said Evans-Cullen, adding that washroom access was something B.C. provincial health officer Bonnie Henry had asked libraries to provide, if possible.

Takeout delivery remains in place at the Sechelt Public Library. Interim library director Leianne Emery anticipates opening the doors to the public to browse shelves by the start of August, but an exact date will depend on a potential building envelope project, “which will affect the library interior,” she said in an email.

In the meantime, three major interior construction projects are underway and protective glass is being installed. Those projects should be completed by July 20, at which point the library will begin adding limited public computer access and in-person tech help to the other services it is already providing, including offering materials for “takeout,” providing online and phone tech help, exam invigilation, photocopying and faxing services and reciprocal borrowing between Sechelt and Gibsons libraries.

The Sechelt library is aiming to have outdoor “under the tent programming” up and running for small groups within the next couple of weeks. And children can pick up their reading logs at either the Gibsons or Sechelt library for the Summer Reading Club.

The Roberts Creek Community Library has been open to the public since June 19 but with modified hours.

In July, the library is open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Sundays from noon to 2 p.m., Tuesdays from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. and Wednesdays from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Safety conditions apply and instructions are available at the library’s entrance. Only one patron and child are allowed inside the building at a time.

A return to in-person services kicked off quietly at the Pender Harbour Reading Centre on July 2, according to board chair Karen Dyck. It is now open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and will be fully staffed with volunteers until the end of August. As with the Roberts Creek library, only one person is allowed inside at a time with some exceptions for children. Masks are required for borrowers and volunteers. And because people have been dropping off materials throughout the COVID-19 epidemic, “we have lots of books on the shelf,” said Dyck.

Over the course of the pandemic, no orders have been issued by the provincial health officer requiring libraries to close.

A May 7 letter from Vancouver Coastal Health’s (VCH) deputy chief medical health officer Mark Lysyshyn stated that VCH “believes that the risk of COVID-19 transmission in these environments can be mitigated and consistent with B.C.’s Restart Plan, that it is possible to safely operate these facilities at this time.”

Libraries must operate with a COVID-19 safety plan in place that draws from WorkSafeBC protocols.",[]

Representatives from Teamsters Canada, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada and Unifor point to the dozens of retail and warehouse workers who remain sickened with COVID-19 and a report Monday from CTV News in Windsor, Ont. that two workers had just tested positive in the border city.

article continues below

Some of those previously sickened have returned to work. A few workers have died from the novel coronavirus disease.

Speaking to a House of Commons committee Monday, the union leaders recommended stricter labour standards and oversight for the sector, beyond getting to the bottom of why the pay premium was abruptly rolled back by some of the largest grocery chains.

Unifor national president Jerry Dias said the fact two more workers now have COVID-19 ""is probably proof positive"" that the pandemic premium for hourly workers shouldn't have disappeared.

When the pandemic struck Canada in March, major grocery chains said they would boost front-line workers' wages on average about $2 per hour.

But late last month, one after another, the chains announced they were ending the pandemic pay bump because the pace of business had eased, giving the unions short notice about the decision.

MPs on the industry committee agreed to look into the matter and will have a chance to question retail executives at the end of the week.

""Look, the argument is nonsense and every one of us on this panel understands that and I will argue they understand that as well,"" Dias said, referring to grocery-chain executives.

""So this had nothing to do with somehow the pandemic, 'Oh we're seeing a pot at the end of the rainbow,' this was a decision made about money.""

Paul Meinema, national president of the food workers' union, said the federal government should play a more active role in boosting wages for workers in the sector.

Grocery stores were among the businesses governments deemed essential services that didn't have to close as public health restrictions forced companies to cut operations to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The pandemic pay was supposed to recognize that workers were being asked to come in to help feed a population ordered to stay home. Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner said she wanted to determine how to properly compensate workers who are being put in that situation.

Spending on things like gasoline and travel fell but spending on groceries has gone up — one of the few areas of the economy where things appeared positive during the lockdowns of April and May.

NDP MP Brian Masse, who represents a riding in Windsor, Ont., said the industry needs more oversight, calling the committee probe ""the first dive at this.""

The byelection is expected to fill the seat of Nick Volkow, an eight-term councillor who recently died of brain cancer. According to provincial laws, a byelection is required to fill a vacancy that opens up prior to an election year.

To kick off the byelection, the city is supposed to appoint a chief election officer, but city staff is recommending that be put off for now, citing concerns around COVID-19. For instance, strict rules on large congregations of people could put a chill on voter turnout, while lifting those rules would create a potential hazard for voters.

According to a staff report to council, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs has deferred byelections in Victoria, Rossland and Lytton, as well as a referendum in Kamloops, to protect residents from COVID-19.

The staff report noted city clerk Kate O’Connell reached out to the ministry to ask about guidelines for votes held during the pandemic. In response, the ministry indicated it was in the process of developing those guidelines and recommended the byelection be deferred.

Staff passed that recommendation on to council ahead of Monday evening’s regular meeting, saying it is “not practicable” to hold a byelection without the guidelines.

The election guidelines are being developed by Elections BC, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, the Local Government Management Association and the Union of B.C. Municipalities, according to the staff report, and development is still in early stages. Staff noted there is still no clear timeline for when those guidelines are expected to be completed.

Options to do so are now on the table as members of Parliament and hundreds of behind-the-scenes staff begin to plan for what their headquarters could look like come fall, to the extent they can.

article continues below

""Is it better to meet in person or virtually come September?"" House of Commons Speaker Anthony Rota said to the procedure and house affairs committee Monday.

""COVID has been changing so drastically along the way it's very difficult to predict what will happen in a month and a half or two months from now.""

But in the meantime, a mobile app could be deployed to allow MPs to vote whether they're on Parliament Hill or off, Rota said.

The app is fully bilingual, meets accessibility standards, and is secure, including providing administrators the ability to know where MPs are when they vote and authenticate their identities.

""The proposed approach for an electronic voting system respects several key principles,"" Rota said.

Finding a way for MPs to vote while limiting the risk of COVID-19 transmission has been a sticking point for the Liberal government as it has faced pressure from the Opposition Conservatives to allow for the full resumption of Parliament.

MPs have grappled with how they can do their jobs ever since Parliament, like much of the rest of the country, shut down in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Several compromises have been reached along the way, including a hybrid model that allows MPs to participate in person or virtually in debates or committee meetings.

Those debates and meetings have been limited in scope and the Opposition Conservatives have pressed for a full return to business that would expand the powers MPs have available to press the government and get more information.

Right now, Parliament is expected to resume sitting full-time on Sept. 21, though there is a single sitting day scheduled for this week.

Summer sitting days were among the concessions opposition parties won as they've fought for greater accountability.

The virtual voting plan is best to be rolled out come fall, Rota said, citing the time needed to get the right system in place.

In addition to an app, he's presented MPs with the option of a video-conferencing approach that would piggyback on the hybrid arrangement in place now.

Rota's report, however, raised several concerns with that, including unstable internet connections, the amount of time it would take, and the sensitive issue of MPs not being present to vote.

A video-conferencing approach would need to name each MP in turn to double-check an MP isn't on mute or having trouble with the connection.

""The absence of members would be highlighted to the public, to the media and to other members of the House, contrary to current practice,"" the report said.

Conservative MPs have come under scrutiny in recent weeks for their absence from the current special COVID-19 committee of MPs that replaced the normal House of Commons sitting.

Unlike in regular sittings, for the committee it is possible to see exactly who attended, and tallies have suggested many Tories haven't shown up regularly.

When it comes to virtual voting, the Conservatives have largely opposed the approach, citing a resistance to anything that keeps MPs off the Hill.

They argue it is possible to adjust regular procedures to allow for physical distancing, and had asked for a look at how voting could take place in person.

Pandemic-safe options could include lining up outside the Commons chamber to vote, voting in shifts or voting by proxy, Rota's analysis suggested.

Among the issues in-person voting raises is the question of time and resources needed to keep the chamber clean as well as how long the votes themselves would take.

The MPs are aiming to have their recommendations in place later this month.

The league says 23 of 396 players checked for COVID-19 at team facilities have tested positive since voluntary Phase 2 workouts began June 8 — a rate of just under six per cent. In that same time period, the NHL added it is aware of 12 additional positive test results.

article continues below

That's an increase of eight players in Phase 2, and one from outside the NHL's testing system, over the last week.

The NHL says it has administered more than 2,900 tests at team facilities.

Ten additional players were confirmed to have tested positive in the spring — five from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins. That brings the total number of NHLers with confirmed positive tests to 45 since the schedule was suspended in mid-March.

The league is no longer providing details on the players or clubs with positive tests. There was no word on the health status of the 35 players in question, including whether or not they experienced symptoms or have recovered.

""All players who have tested positive have been self-isolated and are following (government) protocols,"" the NHL said in a statement released on Twitter.

The league and NHL Players' Association on Sunday night agreed on protocols to start training camps and resume the season. That includes daily testing once games get under way for players, coaches and staff.

Resuming is contingent on each side approving an extension of the collective bargaining agreement and the return-to-play protocol.

The central bank's business outlook survey suggested about half of firms foresee a rebound in their sales within the next year as COVID-19's effects recede, but the expectations of a return to pre-pandemic levels often depend on lifting government-mandated restrictions.

article continues below

The survey report published Monday suggests many service-sector and energy companies don't expect a return to pre-pandemic employment levels.

The worry among workers about losing their jobs rose to the highest level seen in the bank's regular survey of consumer expectations, released alongside the business outlook report.

Workers' expectations of how easily they could find new work dropped to the lowest level in the survey since the 2015 oil-price shock as the country faces a different and far deeper economic crisis.

Lockdowns and stay-at-home requests from governments put the economy in a deep freeze in mid-March, with the thaw beginning in recent weeks as restrictions began to be rolled back.

Nearly half of all businesses reported an outright decline of their sales in the past 12 months because of COVID-19, low energy prices and the uncertainty both wrought.

More than half of businesses expect their total sales over the next 12 months to be lower than they were in the last year, with future sales indicators at record lows.

About half of firms expect their sales will ""mostly recover"" within the next year as COVID-19's effects recede, but the expectations of a return to pre-pandemic levels often depend on lifting government-mandated restrictions. Some companies said they could get back to normal operations within a month of public health restrictions being lifted.

""Overall, while the economy is on the mend, it's still early days and both businesses and consumers will continue to grapple with uncertainty over the foreseeable future,"" TD economist Ksenia Bushmeneva said in a note.

""This will manifest in lower spending by households and weak investment plans by businesses, both of which will weigh on the pace of economic recovery.""

Consumers' expectations for wage growth were below what they anticipated for inflation, while the outlook for growth in household income dropped to its lowest level in the survey's history.

The consumer survey said spending expectations have tumbled, which the bank says suggests consumers have become more cautious due to the economic impact and health risks related to the pandemic.

The bank said consumers expect to spend mostly on essentials and less on durable goods like cars and furniture, as well services that involve face-to-face interactions like eating out, travel or going to the movies.

A Royal Bank report Monday estimated the drop in economic output and sharp rise in spending could put the federal deficit at $265 billion this fiscal year.

The report said deficits could be close to double those the Liberals predicted just over six months ago as revenues drop — not including an expected need to spend more to help the economy recover.

""If they needed to extend some of the (aid) programs to ensure that the economy wasn't going to be ... more meaningfully impacted, they're in the fiscal position to do so,"" said RBC economist Colin Guldimann, who co-wrote the report.

""Of course, there is a position when some spending becomes too much spending and it's really hard to know where that is.""

Federal spending on fighting the pandemic and its effects, by the government's most recent figures, amounts to about $174 billion.

About one-third of service and energy companies told the Bank of Canada they have tapped a federal wage subsidy to reduce or avoid layoffs. Other firms looking to rehire or hire new staff cited an emergency federal benefit for workers as a hurdle to their plans.

The latest figures from the federal government show the $45-billion wage subsidy program has paid nearly $17.1 billion to 245,160 companies as of June 29. Meanwhile, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, or CERB, has paid $53.53 billion in benefits to 8.16 million people as of June 28, since it was introduced in late March.

David Macdonald, senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, argued in a research note Monday that the Liberals shouldn't make deep cuts to their aid measures.

He calculated that households will have a surplus in their budgets by $202.9 billion due to Ottawa's deficit spending, while corporations would see a surplus to the tune of $37.1 billion.

""As federal deficits can create surpluses in other areas, the opposite is also true,"" Macdonald wrote. ""Federal surpluses, through cutbacks and austerity, must force another sector into deficit by the same amount.""

Think you might have symptoms? Take a self-assessment

On this page

Symptoms of COVID-19

Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include:

new or worsening cough

shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

temperature equal to or over 38°C

feeling feverish

chills

fatigue or weakness

muscle or body aches

new loss of smell or taste

headache

gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)

feeling very unwell



Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes.

In severe cases, infection can lead to death.

Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19.

Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who:

have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)

never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)

While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.

If you or your child become ill

If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, reduce your contact with others:

isolate yourself at home for 14 days to avoid spreading it to others if you live with others, stay in a separate room or keep a 2-metre distance

visit a health care professional or call your local public health authority call ahead to tell them your symptoms and follow their instructions



Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the advice for caregivers. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.

If you become sick while travelling back to Canada:

inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer

advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms this is required under the Quarantine Act the Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow



Check if you have been exposed

Have you been on a recent flight, cruise, train, or at a public gathering? Check the listed exposure locations to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Take care of your mental health

The COVID-19 pandemic is new and unexpected. This situation can be unsettling and can cause a sense of loss of control. It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or worried in a crisis. Make sure to care for your mental and physical wellbeing and to ask for help if you feel overwhelmed.

Diagnosing coronavirus

Coronavirus infections are diagnosed by a health care provider based on symptoms and are confirmed through laboratory tests.

Treating coronavirus

Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own.

If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.

Vaccine, therapeutics and medical devices

At this time, a vaccine and therapies to treat or prevent this disease have not yet been identified. But research and development are underway. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global review of therapies that may be used to treat or prevent the disease.

Health Canada is fast tracking the importation and sale of medical devices for use in relation to COVID-19.

Flu vaccine

If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses, but will help prevent the flu. Getting the flu could make you more vulnerable to other infections.

Getting the flu vaccine will not increase your risk of illness from coronavirus. For more information, please refer to this recently published Canadian research study.

About coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.

COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.

There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans. These are the:",[]

Limit contact

Only one healthy person should provide care.

Do not share personal items with the ill person, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices.

Use a separate bathroom from the ill person, if possible. If not possible, the ill person should put the toilet lid down before flushing.

Some people may transmit COVID-19 even though they do not show any symptoms. Wearing a mask, including a non-medical mask or face covering (i.e. made with at least two layers of tightly woven fabric, constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can help protect others around you.

Prevent contact with animals, as there have been several reports of people transmitting COVID-19 to their pets.

Protect yourself

If possible, people who are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 should not care for someone with COVID-19. These people include elderly persons, those with chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) or compromised immune systems.

If you need to be within 2 metres of the ill person, wear personal protective equipment: a medical mask disposable gloves eye protection

Wear disposable gloves when touching the ill person, their environment and soiled items or surfaces.

Avoid re-using medical masks or gloves.

Clean your hands often for at least 20 seconds, especially after contact with the ill person and after removing gloves, face masks and eye protection.

Dry your hands with disposable paper towels. If not available, use a reusable towel and replace it when it becomes wet.

You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Wearing masks Medical masks are recommended for COVID-19 patients in the home and for protection for those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home.

N95 respirators must be reserved for healthcare workers and should not be used for caregiving at home.

If medical masks are not available, non-medical masks or face coverings (i.e. constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can be worn by the ill person, if tolerable. This will cover their mouth and nose, and may prevent respiratory droplets from contaminating others or landing on surfaces.

A non-medical mask or face covering may also be worn by those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home. However, wearing a non-medical mask or facial covering in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it.

Strict hygiene and public health measures, including frequent hand washing and maintaining a physical distance of at least 2 metres from the ill person, will reduce the chance of being exposed to the virus.

Non-medical cloth masks should be carefully removed when soiled or damp, laundered in hot water and then dried thoroughly.

Hands must be cleaned before and after putting on and removing a mask.

Keep your environment clean

Place used medical masks, gloves and other contaminated items in a lined container, secure the contents and dispose of them with other household waste.

Place possibly contaminated laundry, including non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings, into a container with a plastic liner and do not shake. Wash with regular laundry soap and hot water (60-90°C), and dry well. Clothing, linens and non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings belonging to the ill person can be washed with other laundry.

At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch often, such as toilets, laundry containers, bedside tables, doorknobs, phones and television remotes.

Use only approved hard-surface disinfectants that have a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A DIN is an 8-digit number given by Health Canada that confirms the disinfectant product is approved and safe for use in Canada.

When approved hard surface disinfectants are not available, for household disinfection, a diluted bleach solution can be prepared in accordance with the instructions on the label, or in a ratio of 5 millilitres (mL) of bleach per 250 mL of water OR 20 mL of bleach per litre of water. This ratio is based on bleach containing 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Follow instructions for proper handling of household (chlorine) bleach.

If they can withstand the use of liquids for disinfection, high-touch electronic devices (e.g. keyboards, tablets, smartboards) may be disinfected with 70% alcohol (e.g. alcohol prep wipes) at least daily.

Monitor yourself for symptoms

If you have always used the recommended precautions, then monitor yourself for symptoms for 14 days following your last close contact with the ill person.

Quarantine (self-isolate) at home for 14 days from your last exposure and contact your local public health authority if you have no symptoms but: cared for a person who has COVID-19 without the recommended personal protective equipment live with or had close physical contact (e.g. intimate partner) without using the recommended personal protective equipment live with or have had regular close contact (within 2 metres) with a person who has COVID-19 up to 48 hours prior to symptom onset or while they were symptomatic and not isolating had direct contact with the body fluids of a person who has COVID-19 (e.g. were coughed or sneezed on) without the recommended personal protective equipment



If you start to develop symptoms, isolate yourself as quickly as possible and contact your local public health authority for further instructions.

Maintain these supplies

Medical masks if available, or non-medical mask or face covering

Eye protection (face shield or goggles) for use by caregiver

Disposable gloves (do not re-use) for use by caregiver

Disposable paper towels

On Tuesday July 14, 2020, Dr. Bonnie Henry, Provincial Health Officer and Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, announced 13 new cases of COVID-19 in the province for a total of 3,128 cases in British Columbia. Of the total COVID-19 cases, 14 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,015 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. There are no new community outbreaks, but there have been several exposure events particularly in the Kelowna area. These occurred when a group of people from different areas including the Okanagan, lower mainland and Alberta got together. To date, 17 of these individuals have tested positive for COVID-19. Dr. Henry says as people become more active and travel, we will see more cases. Public health teams are actively working to manage cases and clusters as they emerge and keep new cases low and slow. Of note, the first incubation period since Canada Day is now complete.



Economic and fiscal update for 2020-21

The British Columbia government is forecasting a $12.5 billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The provincial budget for 2020, tabled just months before the global pandemic, predicted a budget surplus of $227 million for 2020-21. Carole James, Minister of Finance, says the pandemic has exposed underlying gaps in our economy and society, and reminded us of the need for strong public services and supports. Government has supported people and businesses with $6.26 billion in COVID-19 supports to date. That includes the $5 billion in supplementary spending for B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan supports, such as workers benefits, rent supplements, income and disability assistance supports and economic recovery funding. These are in addition to $1.26 billion in other tax and relief measures for people and businesses, including the one-time increase to the climate action tax credit and property tax reductions for businesses.

Warning about calls appearing to come from Squamish General Hospital



Vancouver Coastal Health is warning the public not to provide personal information over the phone if they receive an unexpected call that appears to come from Squamish General Hospital. Someone claiming to be a hospital employee is calling people and asking for their full names, social insurance number and date of birth. This is in no way associated with Vancouver Coastal Health, and appears to be a phishing scam, where people are tricked into providing personal information that can be used fraudulently. RCMP have been advised.



Testing

Anyone in the VCH region with cold, influenza or COVID-19-like symptoms, however mild, can now be assessed for and get a COVID-19 test. Contact your physician or nurse practitioner's office, or a local community collection centre to arrange for a test. Phone numbers and locations of collection centre can be found by visiting: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing or by calling 8-1-1. In Vancouver, the City Centre and REACH urgent and primary care centres can provide testing as well as the St. Vincent's drive-up location at 4875 Heather Street. The Richmond Assessment Centre is located at 6820 Gilbert Road, in the parking lot of the Richmond Tennis Club. On the North Shore, testing is available at the North Vancouver Urgent and Primary Care Centre. If you think you need testing, please call ahead before visiting your doctor, urgent and primary care center or health clinic.



VCH Medical Health Officers, our provincial partners and the Public Health Agency of Canada continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic.

Life is Still Funny: Comedy for Cozmos is a virtual night of stand-up comedy that’s taking place on Friday, May 29. The online comedy show will bring together seven stand-up comics in support of Cozmos Café + Bistro in North Burnaby.

article continues below

It’s being brought together by Ray Morrison, a Burnaby resident who’s been running a monthly Cozmos Comedy show at the eatery for the past year.

“These have been extremely successful, well-attended shows,” he said in an email. “As with all restaurants, and many other small businesses, the owners of this restaurant are going through some difficult times these days. As they have been great supporters of stand-up comedy, we would now like to pay them back for their generosity.”

Audience members who want to check out the comedy show (which will be live on Zoom) can pay $5 for the show only, or they can pay $10, $20 or $50 towards a gift certificate from the restaurant that they can use in the future – with the comedy night thrown in.

“This will be a free show for most, with a delicious meal at their convenience to come,” Morrison explained, noting it’s a win for the local business. “The restaurant gets the guarantee of some up-front money and future business to come. All money taken in will go to the restaurant.”

Morrison, who just marked his 65th birthday, says he had always intended to put all of his focus on his comedy from here on out – but the pandemic just changed the form that will take.

He’s hoping to see the comedy series turn into a weekly event that will help a different cause each week, with a focus on helping local business.

“As I do not see masses of people feeling comfortable reverting immediately to the old habits, many of these businesses will have a long road ahead,” he pointed out. “They need our support more than ever.”

Life is Still Funny: Comedy for Cozmos is set for Friday, May 29. Showtime is 8 p.m. For details and to buy your tickets, see the listing on Eventbrite.

The popular neighbourhood art event in North Burnaby is back after a one-year hiatus – and this time, it’s heading into cyberspace in response to COVID-19.

Living Room Art in the Heights: the Virtual Edition is coming on Saturday, May 30.

“For years, Living Room Art in the Heights has been bringing the community of Burnaby North together through art,” said a press release from artists and organizers Yunuen Perez Vertti and Grant Withers.

In past editions, artists would convert a house into an “art gallery” for an evening, where local artists could invite their neighbours in and share their work in a variety of visual and performing arts disciplines – painting, sculpture, photography, film, storytelling, dance, music and more.

“In the current situation, although not able to share the same physical space, we aim to bring a similar experience of connectedness through an online/virtual space,” the organizers said. “We hope to convey the same celebratory spirit and inclusivity our audience has come to expect from a Living Room Art event.”

The event will use online meeting software and run about an hour-and-a-half.

To simulate the previous live, in-person Living Room Art experiences, there will be different “room” sessions available via separate links, and each artist will host a session. Audience members will be able to jump from one session to another within the length of the event.

What exactly those links will look like will vary depending on the artist. Some will offer virtual tours of their studio spaces, while others will have site-specific art installations or digital visual art displays via screen sharing. There will also be performances and art workshops, and the audience will be able to interact with the artists through question-and-answer sessions.

About 10 artists from North Burnaby will be sharing their work with the community.

Participants lined up so far are photographic artist Grant Withers, painters Sheila Chowdhury and Dianne Yard, photographer Carolyn Sullivan, textile and mixed-media artist Dawn Livera, visual artist Tami Cline and flutist Keri Povall. Other performers include Leith Davis and Marilyn Noort, who will offer up Irish music in one of the virtual “rooms,” and a small group of students from the Burnaby North Secondary School music production program – Julia Ramsey, Kalyan Rath and Haleluya Hailu – who will perform original compositions they produced while in the program..

The event is being funded by a Vancouver Foundation Neighbourhood Small Grant.

Living Room Art in the Heights: Virtual Edition is set for Saturday, May 30. It starts at 7:30 p.m. and will run until 9 p.m.

It’s free and open to the public. See livingroomarttheheights.wordpress.com for all the details and a link to the event on the night. You can also follow Living Room Art in the Heights on social media (@artroom_Heights on Twitter, @livingroomartheights on Instagram, @artintheheights on Facebook) to keep on top of the news.

Now the North Burnaby foursome is out to prove they’re one of Canada’s most talented families.

They’ve been chosen as semifinalists in Canadian Family’s Got Talent, a new contest that’s being run by Citytv’s Breakfast Television and America’s Got Talent.

Families across the country were invited to submit videos showcasing their particular talent – from music to dance to magic – and semifinalists are being featured on Breakfast Television out of Toronto each morning until May 13. The Maddocks were featured on May 5.

Entering the contest happened on a bit of a whim.

Maddock notes the family has been jamming together pretty much every day since the COVID-19 pandemic hit, when both Maddock and Olesen found their lives as professional musicians put on hold.

“Gigs just can’t happen right now,” Maddock pointed out. “Even if I was scheduled to be performing with a duo or a trio in a small café, not even that can happen. … I have a lot of colleagues in the musical theatre industry whose shows have been cancelled; entire seasons have been cancelled.”

Their lives as choral singers have also been put on indefinite hold. Maddock currently sings with the 12-voice professional ensemble musica intima; Olesen is on leave from the same group.

But musica intima, as with all other choirs, is also on hiatus – and possibly for an extended period of time.

“The Vancouver choral community is reeling right now,” Maddock said, noting a recent international webinar that explored the near-term future of group singing and came to the conclusion that choral singing is one of the most effective ways to spread COVID-19.

“Singing is one of the worst things you can do,” Maddock pointed out. “You’re emoting all these droplets while you sing.”

Though musicians have continued to make music virtually, using a variety of online tools to merge individually recorded parts, it’s not like making music together.

“The problem with online is there’s no web conferencing platform, Zoom or Facetime or Skype or whatever - there’s no platform that allows you to do things from different locations in real time without there being latency and time lag,” Maddock pointed out. “People can’t play music together in real time.”

That, he said, has been hard on people in the music world.

“A lot of musicians are really hurting,” he said. “There are a lot of heavy hearts right now.”

Take all of that as a backdrop, then add in the fact that the household has two teenagers at home – 13-year-old Kai, who’s about finish his elementary school career at Montecito Elementary, and 18-year-old Aubrey, who’s set to graduate from Burnaby Mountain Secondary.

“Neither one of them get to really enjoy the grad festivities,” Maddock said. “It’s been a real drag for our kids in that way. They’re doing their schooling online. It’s going OK, but even Kai is saying, ‘Man, I really wish I could just go back to school and have things the way they were.’”

Their saving grace? Music.

“We’ve done little family jam sessions from time to time, but as soon as the quarantine isolation started, we were doing something almost on a nightly basis,” Maddock said. “We would just kind of take turns playing different instruments and singing.”

He’s been whipping up arrangements of a variety of songs for those nightly sessions and then recording them on his phone. One of those videos was an arrangement of the Louis Prima jazz classic Banana Split For My Baby, featuring Maddock on piano and lead vocals, with backing by Olesen and Aubrey, and percussion by Kai.

Maddock shared it to Facebook, thinking family and friends might get a kick out of it – and, overnight, it unexpectedly “kinda exploded” on his page. Friends of friends of friends were sharing it, and in no time it had 1,000 views.

People Maddock doesn’t even know were commenting on the video, with a whole host of comments along the lines of: “Please post more of these; you have no idea how you have affected my day” and “That was three minutes where I didn’t have to think about the fact that I’m not working or how I’m going to pay my rent.”

The reaction was a reminder to Maddock of the incredible healing power of music – and of people’s yearning for positivity and hope in a world that’s full of negative stories.

“It made me realize, with the climate right now on all the social media platforms, people are just aching for live content and anything that’s going to give them even a brief diversion from all the anxiety and uncertainty and all the gloom and doom,” he said.

When a Facebook friend alerted him to the Canadian Family’s Got Talent contest, Maddock decided, “Why not?”

So he sent in the video, and within a couple of days, he’d heard back from a Breakfast Television producer in Toronto inviting them to appear on the show.

Their video is now live online with the other semifinalists’ entries.

Starting May 14, audiences across Canada will have a chance to vote for their favourites, and three finalists’ videos will be seen and judged by none other than Simon Cowell of American Idol and America’s Got Talent fame.

Maddock has never been a big follower of the reality talent shows, so he knew of Cowell’s curmudgeonly persona only by reputation. But if the family could hit the finals and have their video judged by Cowell?

“It’d be fun to get to that point and be able to hear what he has to say, for sure,” Maddock said.

Regardless of the outcome of the contest, though, he wants his family to keep making music together.

“Once COVID is over and we get back to whatever the new normal is, … I hope that my family continues to have these regular jam sessions in our living room,” Maddock said. “It’s definitely been good for us.”

In recent days, both the Arts Club Theatre Company and Vancouver Opera have announced efforts to help out through the pandemic crisis.

article continues below

Arts Club Theatre Company, which temporarily closed its doors on March 17, has announced that it’s repurposing its spaces at the BMO Theatre Centre to aid in the COVID-19 response efforts.

The rehearsal studio space is being turned over to the Vancouver-based open-source medical technology initiative COSMIC (Collective Open Source Medical Innovations for COVID-19) Medical. COSMIC will be using a studio to build and showcase their novel design solutions, including ventilators and respiratory equipment.

The space is being loaned out free of charge.

“At this time, with the temporary closure of our theatres, we couldn’t think of a better use for our facility than to provide free space to the COSMIC team,” said artistic director Ashlie Corcoran in a press release. “As a Vancouver theatre company dedicated to the development of local storytelling and voices, collaborating with COSMIC to showcase their exciting medical innovations is a perfect way for us to continue to celebrate local talent.”

COSMIC sought out the Arts Club’s studio because of its capacity to support media and videography. The group aims to use the space to demonstrate the use of their products, which include a clinical respiratory support system that’s being developed as a low-cost approach to providing care for COVID-19 patients.

“When a crisis brings together collaboration, creativity and commitment at this speed, it brings out the best in us all,” said Dr. Christopher Nguan, co-founder of COSMIC Medical, in the release. “COSMIC not only has an overarching mission to prepare for COVID-19 and future pandemics, but we are challenging one another and collaborating with groups like the Arts Club to come up with creative solutions to improve health outcomes and, we hope, save lives.”

The venue’s costume shop has also been repurposed during the pandemic.

Staff from the Arts Club’s costume and production departments – some of whom were laid off due to COVID-19 and then rehired as a result of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy – go into the shop one by one to sew masks and scrub caps for a local initiative called Protect our Frontline Vancouver. The group is on a mission to build a supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line workers and health-care professionals.

So far, the Arts Club team has sewn 110 scrub caps and more than 300 masks, and recipients have included Vancouver General Hospital and East Vancouver’s Lakeview Care Home.

“With the ability to hire back most full-time employees through the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy program, it has been inspiring to see our staff come together for the good of our community and provide these services to care facilities in need,” said executive director Peter Cathie White.

A similar effort is underway at Vancouver Opera’s costume shop, which is also now working backstage to build masks for the community.

Tom Wright, Vancouver Opera’s general director, noted in a press release that Vancouver Opera was eager to find a way to help workers in essential and vulnerable positions who were unable to access masks.

“Our goal is to get these into the hands of those who need them as quickly as possible,” he said. “With the cancellation of our season, our employees began to research ways they could help, which include how to build non-surgical-grade masks. We found most of the resources needed were already here in our costume shop.”

The charitable program is being led by Autumn Coppaway, Vancouver Opera’s technical director, and Parvin Mirhady, head of costumes.

They work together to ensure all steps of the project are done with proper social distancing and hygiene. Once materials are dropped off to members of the sewing team, completed masks are picked up and delivered directly to organizations by Coppaway.

“We, as artists, are so diverse and passionate because we expose the greatest and weakest of humanity,” Coppaway said in the release. “In these moments of darkness, art reminds us that we each can be that light. Though our stages are dark, our hearts and spirits are not, and we still have stories to tell. And this is our story and Vancouver Opera’s small contribution.”

Vancouver Opera will be donating non-surgical-grade masks to community organizations including the Kettle Society.

It’s accepting donations to support the effort; they can be made online at www.vancouveropera.ca. Donations of $25 help provide five masks; $100 provides 25 masks.",[]

The Vancouver-based choir has joined the Lower Mainland choral community in cancelling the rest of its 2019/20 season – but it’s still making music.

At the end of March, the choir released its Coronavirus Rhapsody parody video, which became an online and social media hit.

Earlier this month, the choir decided to return to the world of online music-making with a new video: a parody of Billy Joel’s For the Longest Time, with new words written for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Singers (choir members and alumni) recorded their individual parts at home in their own spaces, accompanied by a “click track,” and then sent in the videos for editing and compilation.

The magical end result has just been revealed and is now available on Youtube – and it seems certain to also be a social media hit.

Rosemary Siemens is offering a Sunday hymn sing-along at 10 a.m. on Sunday, April 12.

“A lot of churches are closed, so it gives people a chance to hear music they love and hopefully sing from the comfort of their homes,” Siemens wrote in an email.

She’ll be offering up a variety of hymns, by request, on piano, and viewers can sing along from wherever they are watching from.

Siemens’ Easter Sunday offering is an extension of her ongoing Sunday Hymn Serenade on YouTube, where she releases a new video of herself performing a hymn every Sunday morning, followed by an inspirational story. Through taking hymn requests and sharing those stories, Siemens has gained more than 10,900 subscribers in her first six months of the series, with more than 2.7 million views on her hymn videos.

“When I launched my Sunday Hymn Serenade YouTube series, it was specifically to achieve my goal of bringing hymns back into churches, but I never imagined it would turn into a global music ministry,” she said in a press release.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Siemens said, she’s been hearing from people around the world thanking her for sharing a message of faith and hope in troubling times.

With the huge response to her Sunday Hymn Serenade, Siemens has also launched a new Worship Wednesday series on her YouTube channel. Every Wednesday edition features her performing a song, with an inspiring and timely story to follow.

The Sunday Hymn Serenade and Worship Wednesday both happen at 7 a.m. Pacific (10 a.m. Eastern).

The Easter Sunday sing-along event is at 10 a.m. Pacific (1 p.m. Eastern).

You can check out more at Siemens’ YouTube channel or follow Siemens on Facebook.

Siemens recently took home two awards in a ceremony presented online by Gospel Music Awards Canada on March 21: one for Children’s Song of the Year, for You and Me, a song she wrote with Jaylene Johnson for her son, Theodore; and the other for Instrumental Song of the Year, for a duet rendition of Lauren Daigle’s hit You Say. That was recorded by Siemens and her husband, saxophonist Eli Bennett, who perform together as SaxAndViolin.

Siemens and Bennett had originally been scheduled to perform at the Gospel Music Awards Canada ceremony in Langley. Instead, the whole family accepted the awards during the online awards ceremony that brought together Christian artists from across Canada in virtual format.

“It was so special to not only win the Gospel Music Award for Children’s Song of the Year for the song I wrote for Theodore, but to accept the award together with him and my husband Eli was just a blessing,” Siemens said in a press release. “Theodore was on my lap while we were giving the acceptance speech, and because this was his song, having him be a part of it just meant so much to us.”

He’s a prop and costume maker (www.panda-props.com) who does work for the cosplay world, for collectors and for the film and TV industry.

It was a social-media post of the friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend kind that made him realize his skills could come in very handy as the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was a simple post: a nurse looking for some kind of “ear-saving” device that could be worn to help prevent ear chafing from wearing a face mask for long hours.

“I thought, ‘OK, I could make those,’” said Chui, a Burnaby resident.

It’s not a new concept, he noted, but hospitals don’t tend to purchase them because they’re not seen as a mandatory part of personal protective equipment but rather as an accessory – and therefore an extra expense. And, in the usual course of things, most health-care workers don’t wear masks for hours on end so they’re not really necessary anyway.

A health-care worker uses one of the Ear Savers donated through a new campaign. - contributed

These days, however, with so many health-care workers putting in long shifts in masks – in some cases even in double masks – there’s a much greater call for an ear-saving device.

“People have been making them out of paper clips, plastic bags, surgical tubing. They were trying all these make-do solutions,” Chui said.

Such devices already existed, but Chui decided to model his own – with a bit of a twist. Instead of just a simple band to stretch across the back of the wearer’s head, he’s incorporated a number of motivational phrases. “Stay strong,” “You can do it” and “Hero at work” are among the offerings. And, because he’s a cosplay guy, he also had to throw in some fun, nerdy phrases – so you’ll find “Boldly go” for the Star Trek fans and “Expecto patronum” for the Harry Potter crowd, among others.

“I wanted to keep it positive,” he said. “I think right now we need something that’s light and fun and positive, too.”

The devices are simple and adjustable so they can be worn with any hairstyle, short or long, up or down, and they’re made of lightweight PLA (polylactic acid, a vegetable-based plastic material) that’s just over a millimetre thick.

Chui started by printing them on the 3-D printers in his own workshop, and then he put the call out among members of the 501st Legion, a Star Wars charity costuming group he’s part of.

Now there are a dozen or so printers working on the project, and volunteers were close to distributing 1,200 of the Ear Savers as of Monday, April 6. (And, yes, everyone is following strict hygiene protocols, including cleaning printers with alcohol, wearing gloves while handling them and placing the product straight into Ziploc bags once they’re completed.)

Chui has had volunteers deliver loads to hospitals across the Lower Mainland and the Fraser Valley, and the Ear Savers immediately became popular with health-care workers.

Terry Chui's Ear Savers come with a variety of inspirational and fun sayings. - contributed

“The stories that have been coming our way are amazing,” Chui said.

He tells the story of one nurse who, at the end of a long shift, tried to go and buy groceries but found a giant lineup awaiting her. She got in her car and broke down and cried – and then she looked down at her Ear Saver, which said “Stay strong.”

“She just bawled her eyes out, and then she just sucked it up,” Chui says, adding she told them she just needed to see the words in that moment. “She said, ‘I’m gonna keep this (Ear Saver) forever.’”

The project is being conducted on a strictly non-profit basis. All the Ear Savers are being given away for free; donations are being accepted on a limited basis just to cover the cost of materials. Anything that’s left over will be donated to charity, likely to B.C. Children’s Hospital.

Chui is even making his models available so that other folks who want to 3-D print their own to give away can do so. There are only two requirements: one, that no one charges any money for them; and two, that they check in advance with any health-care facility they want to donate to, because there may be specific protocols to follow.

Chui has been running his own printers basically 22 hours a day to keep the supplies coming.

“Today has been my fifth day staying up till about three in the morning printing this thing,” he said with a laugh.

He’ll keep the effort going as long as he can, he said, and as long as it’s required. Chui noted the B.C. government has issued calls for all kinds of products required in the COVID-19 fight, but those efforts require larger production runs than can happen with home hobbyists.

Not too far down the road, he said, the effort to create such devices will likely be taken over by larger companies that can fulfil huge orders for them.

“What we’re doing is we’re providing a stop-gap measure,” he said. “At least we can kind of fill that niche right now.”

Chui is just sorry that he can’t go see health-care workers himself to say thank-you in person for their efforts.

“I would love to meet these people and shake their hands,” he said. “I want to thank them for doing what they do. They’re doing the hard part, health-care workers; for me, this is what I can do right now.”

Burnaby’s arts community, as with arts communities across the country, is facing unprecedented challenges in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

If you’re an arts lover sitting at home wondering how to help, here are a few ideas:

MAKE A DONATION

This one’s an obvious one: For those who are financially positioned to do so, a donation to the arts group of your choice will be more welcome than ever.

KEEP THOSE TICKETS

If you have tickets to a performance that’s been cancelled, why not hang onto them? Rather than seeking your money back, you can check with the organization to ensure you can keep the tickets and use them for any future scheduled performances. Or, simply turn the cost of the tickets into a donation to the organization.



BUY GIFT CERTIFICATES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS

Although theatres have gone dark, it doesn’t mean you can’t buy tickets – for yourself, or as a gift. Many organizations (especially larger groups such as Arts Club Theatre Company and the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra) offer subscription packages. You can buy now, and whenever shows are up and running again, you can enjoy the show.

SHARE THE LOVE

Many arts groups and artists are still active on social media. Follow them, and interact with their posts. Amplify their voices by sharing their posts to your audiences on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Start discussions about theatre, about art, about music, about literature – keep favourite memories alive and share plans for the future.

LISTEN ONLINE

Love music? Search out a local performer’s YouTube channel and watch their videos. Listen on Spotify. Better yet, buy an album. Musicians will keep on making music – you can play your part as an audience member by encouraging them to do it. Then follow your favourites on social media and, as above, share the love.

VIEW ONLINE

Love visual arts? You don’t have to go to a gallery to find art. Search out artists online – and, if you can, buy a work of art. You can make connections to local artists through websites such as www.burnabyartistsguild.com and 100braidststudios.com.

TAKE PART IN FUNDRAISERS

It’s early days yet, but as artists and arts groups organize to start fundraisers, it’s a great way to support the arts and enjoy some entertainment in the comfort of your own home. For instance, local musical theatre performers are taking part in Do You Hear the People Sing? A Quarantine Cabaret to raise money for the Arts Club Theatre Company. See more here.

We’ll continue to follow local fundraisers and will bring you details as we learn about them.

PLAY YOUR PART

Help bring this whole COVID-19 pandemic to an end earlier rather than later by playing your part and observing all the now-familiar directives. Stay home. Go out for essentials only. When you must go out, be sure to preserve social distance by leaving at least two metres of space between you and other people. Wash your hands often and avoid touching your face. If you have any symptoms, stay home.

The sooner we can help to “bend the curve,” the sooner we’ll all be back to enjoying our local arts scene again.

The Vancouver-area men’s choir will share the livestream on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.

The Inside Chor Leoni Livestream will be hosted by artistic director Erick Lichte, from his home, and will include high-quality concert videos from the past seven years of filming at the choir’s shows.

The choir will also be creating new video content from its albums, pairing its music with artwork from local artists in an effort to reach out and help all artists as much as it can at a time that’s challenging the entire arts and cultural sector.

The livestream will also include a weekly guest – a locally or internationally recognized music luminary, with an interview and video.

Viewers will also be able to interact within the live comments section.

Lichte underscored the importance of choral music, especially at this time of global uncertainty.

“I believe that choral music has a unique healing quality,” he said in a press release. “It can offer serenity, beauty and can connect with people in ways I don’t even understand. We want to pair this music power with the fun wrapping of a show in a way that is very Chor Leoni.

“Choral music is, for me, the ultimate way in which people can come together. This show won’t replace the community we share as a choir and with our audience, but hopefully it will move us from our current reality to the day we can again bring our voices together and they can be heard.”

For the April 1 livestream, the guest is conductor Ethan Sperry, talking about Translations, his new recording of the works of Latvian composer Eriks Esenvalds on the Naxos label.

The show will also premiere the first video for the album’s recording of Esenvalds’ In Paradisum, paired in video with paintings by renowned Vancouver artist Tiko Kerr.

Bailey, who’s an actor, singer and private music teacher, watched as her musical theatre friends, one after another, posted on social media about shows – and their professional working contracts – being cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bailey, who’s still able to continue one-on-one teaching – virtually – with her students, realized how fortunate she is to have work.

“I just kinda felt like, you know what? For once I’m not wishing I was on a contract. I’m teaching; I have something a bit solid right now,” Bailey said. “I’m really, really feeling for the other artists.”

So she started thinking: What could she do to help those other performers?

Bailey realized that all the performers she knows tend to put out videos and share them on social media. That inspired her to think about bringing some of those videos together as a fundraiser and a way to support artists.

The result is Do You Hear the People Sing? A Quarantined Cabaret, an ongoing virtual fundraiser for the Arts Club Theatre Company. Musical theatre performers are recording their own videos from the safety of self-isolation, then uploading them to YouTube. Audience members can watch and enjoy – and make a donation to the fundraiser if they’re so inclined.

“Musical theatre people tend to keep making music wherever they are. When we’re scared or sad, we don’t stop singing,” Bailey noted. “I kinda thought maybe there’s a way to bring all those videos together and have a GoFundMe link.”

Bailey admits it wasn’t easy deciding who the effort should raise money for. Her first thought was to create a fund for individual artists, but with so many people in need, who would she help?

She realized, talking it over with her musical theatre colleague and co-organizer Andy Toth, that the answer to helping individual artists was to help a larger cause.

“The best way for me to actually do that was to try to help the largest employer of artists in the city, and that’s Arts Club,” she said.

Bailey noted that upwards of 250 people have had their livelihoods affected by the Arts Club’s temporary shutdown – not just performing artists under contract, but the more than 120 people employed in other capacities by the company.

Bailey’s official GoFundMe goal is $1,000 – an amount she admits is relatively small.

“It’s likely a bit symbolic,” she said.

But, even more than the money, she wanted to offer up the Quarantined Cabaret as a community-building exercise – to let all performing artists in the city know that there’s a place for them and to build solidarity at a difficult time.

“We weren’t sure how much money would come from this,” she said. “Mostly we wanted to find a way to bring the community together.”

Any musical theatre performers interested in taking part can find all the guidelines on the Facebook event page (search out Do You Hear the People Sing? A Quarantined Cabaret).

All performers are being asked to choose songs that speak to the themes of the pandemic crisis.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Mario Canseco is president of Research Co.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians.

That’s the recipe that’s made WINGS a stand-out success in the restaurant industry in recent years, no small feat in a field known for being highly competitive, ever-changing and fast-paced.

WINGS currently has 13 locations, including its headquarters here in Burnaby and a restaurant on Kingsway, with an eye to opening more throughout Western Canada in the near future.

“The WINGS concept is unique,” said Jeff Perham, director of marketing and business development. “We are more of a family-friendly sports bar and we really encourage all locations to create an atmosphere where everyone is welcome.”

Their menu is known for their trademark wings available in 27 flavours as diverse as Bangkok Chili and Lime, New York Dill Pickle, Cairo Kicker, Canadian Maple Bourbon, to name just a few. But their offerings go far beyond the wings menu, with salads, sandwiches and plenty more.

“Many people think WINGS is a regular wing joint, but we have a large variety of offerings besides wings – great pastas, vegetarian options such as cauliflower wings for example, a kids menu and a really awesome happy hour.”

No matter the location or the customer, the goal is always the same: to give each person that comes through the door a great experience with fantastic food and top-notch service. In fact, their motto is “Absolutely is the Only Answer.”

“We want a guest to have fun while at a WINGS restaurant,” he said. “Each guest that comes into WINGS is treated like family and our staff go the extra mile to ensure that a guest feels special and leaves wanting to come back the next day.”

Perham notes that their menu is known for its quality and quantity while also being competitively and affordably priced, and that they are always looking for new ways to innovate and offer the best options for customers.

“We want to focus on what we do really well and continue to keep up with trends,” he said. “We want to be leaders, so our teams are always looking for, and predicting, what may be the next hot thing down the road.”

Perham notes that they don’t want to just be known as a great destination for food and fun – but also as an integral part of each city they’re in.

“We really have a focus on helping our communities,” he said.

This has included running an annual BCSPCA fundraiser, the Say it with WINGS partnership with the Amanda Todd Legacy, a Free Lunch for Veterans program, ongoing support to the BC Children’s Hospital and a variety of other sponsorships.

“We are always looking for ways to give back to the community and to be able to give back.”

Perham says its an exciting time for the organization as they look at expanding, both in terms of being able to offer their unique offerings to more customers but also about bringing on new team members across all levels of the organization.

“WINGS is all about family, which includes the head office teams, our staff, managers, operators and of course, our guests.”

The CSF is part of the public education system in British Columbia and uses the same curriculum in its schools as is used in every other public school around the province.

The student population at CSF has been growing steadily over the last five years in both the elementary and high school grades.

""Compared to other schools in the Vancouver area,"" says Claude Martin, principal of l'école Jules-Verne, a CSF high school in Vancouver, ""we're ahead of the game when it comes to students graduating with two languages. The big advantage of being bilingual comes when they leave school. There's a great demand for bilingual employees.""

M. Martin and his colleagues at other CSF high schools challenge the assumption that students in the French school district lack English language skills and/or vocabulary. In fact, students at CSF high schools consistently score higher than their unilingual counterparts in mandatory English language tests.

""A benefit of a student graduating with both French and English languages,"" says M. Martin, ""is that students can earn two certificates: the Diplôme de fin d'études secondaires in French and the Dogwood Diploma in English. They can go on to the university of their choice – whether that is a French or English university, here or abroad – and their opportunities in the job market are much better. Every year I have government representatives coming to my school to talk to the Grade 12 students. Bilingual students are in demand.""

Another benefit of a CSF high school education is the opportunity to graduate from an International Baccalaureate (IB) program. This internationally recognized diploma is accepted by many universities worldwide.

""Apart from the academic achievement,"" says M. Martin, ""the IB program teaches students work habits and life skills. Armed with an IB diploma, students will find the first year of university easier because of the exceptional work habits the IB program gives them.""

The business offers two different services. The first is 26,000 square feet of event and co-working space, which includes boardrooms and meeting rooms that can be rented. There is also a 10,000-square-foot tech lab space. The second arm of the business is the incubator program where a team of engineers and marketers support inventors in developing their business ideas. “We’re trying to be like a tech hub in the Lower Mainland for inventors who are just starting out with a new project,” says Gyles.

Considering their focus on all three of these areas, it comes as no surprise that HUB International has built an incredible reputation over the years, including being awarded the 2019 Business of the Year by the Burnaby Board of Trade.

HUB is a full-service insurance brokerage offering coverage and protection for businesses and individuals, from liability and property coverage, to home, auto, travel, marine, life, employee benefits, and risk services.

With more than 400 offices across the US and Canada, HUB’s local region is headquartered here in Burnaby and covers 13 offices in Richmond, Surrey, Abbotsford, Aldergrove, Maple Ridge, Coquitlam, Burnaby, and Vancouver.

Dave Terry, the president of HUB International Canada West, says the company’s extensive network, structured around regional hubs and satellite offices across the continent, is part of what gives them an edge in helping customers by pairing the resources and influence of a global broker with the personalized expertise of a local provider.

“Most of our clients come to us for liability and property coverage for their businesses, followed by home and auto coverage for individuals, and employee benefits coverage for a variety of organizations,” he said. “We believe most HUB customers want complete, convenient insurance protection under one roof. Our clients are looking for options and alternatives, and trust us to make informed recommendations for them.”

He adds that a large part of their success has stemmed from developing “specialty practices” in which specialists in a variety of sectors can offer unique expertise for a variety of needs.

It’s all part of a consistent focus on providing top-notch customer service.

“Excellence for us means to operate with the utmost integrity, leading and conducting one’s self in a manner that exemplifies this trait,” said Terry. “Clients trust us to find the right insurance solutions for their particular needs, and when they’re served by a HUB insurance advisor, they know they’re dealing with knowledgeable insurance experts.” As their reputation has grown, so too has the organization itself both through new clients and adding local offices to the HUB network.

“When it comes to expanding our business through acquisitions, we are highly strategic; ensuring a new broker partner is a good fit for our corporate culture and has the same client focus as HUB is key,” he said. “Our customers recognize great service and the word-of-mouth advertising we get from our clients has been a tremendous help within the communities we operate in. I believe our entrepreneurial spirit, something we look for in all our employees, has been a driving force that allows us to stand out amongst our competitors.” As well, they continue to grow their areas of specialty as needs change and evolve – while also keeping an eye on the fundamentals.

“One of the most exciting things is that we’re involved in every industry – many of our employees are specialists in areas like real estate and property management, transportation, cross border and multinational companies, employee benefits, and emerging risks such as cannabis. We’re passionate about what’s important to our clients,” he said. “It is of utmost importance to us at HUB that we deliver on our promises to our clients.”

That’s the message local counsellor Nicole Jenkins has for those impacted during the current Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home advisories.

article continues below

Help getting through the anxiety of decreased social contact and an uncertain future is merely a phone call or videoconference link away.

“There are a lot of losses people are experiencing, which is bringing out strong emotions they may not know how to manage,” says Jenkins, who has been working as a counsellor since 1994.

A prominent factor is the social isolation many are encountering as social distancing has kept them away from their friends, loved ones, and regular social support networks.

“The pressure of isolation and multiple losses, whether it’s losing people you know or your job - if you don’t have really strong skills and practices in place for managing your feelings, which most people don’t have, then you are going to find things difficult because all of a sudden you’re facing these strong emotions, isolation, and, perhaps, even financial loss,” Jenkins says.

In a regular setting, Jenkins said she’d see clients dealing with childhood issues, grief and loss, anxiety, perfectionism, parenting and relationship issues, family and workplace stress.

The Covid-19 pandemic however, presents a whole new list of challenges.

“Collectively, we are facing many types of loss, not just loss of life,” she said. “It’s an especially important time to know how to grieve and process your feelings so you can stay healthy and avoid depression.”

It’s like a perfect storm of conditions where there are no hard and fast answers, she adds.

“We are all immersed in this unprecedented level of uncertainty. And the emotion that comes up from that is hard to focus on.”

Fortunately, there is help.

“It’s important for people to find support during this difficult time,” Jenkins says. “The burden many are facing is much more than what we are used to, and the assistance to get through this period requires special skills that mental health workers can provide.

“But the truth is the situation we are in now will change,” she explains. “It’s not permanent. But since we can’t see the end, because we’ve never been here before, we don’t know what that change will look like.”

To help encourage those requiring help to make contact during the Covid-19 pandemic, Jenkins is offering a free, 30-minute initial online counselling session.

The foundation has been the fundraising organization for Burnaby Hospital since 1982, helping to fund new and upgraded medical equipment and technology at the local facility and in its related programs.

And while it continues to celebrate astounding successes – such as $650,000 in recent upgrades to the Fellburn Care Centre, and funding for new equipment ranging from ventilators to ultrasounds – it is always looking ahead to the future, too.

This last year, the foundation has been focused on efforts that will continue to build connections in the local community. The new Chinese Ambassador Society (CAS), for example, is helping to grow and strengthen relationships between the foundation and the sizeable Chinese communities in Burnaby and East Vancouver.

It has already proven remarkably impactful, recruiting passionate new volunteers who are keen to see the foundation succeed in its ongoing efforts. In fact, CAS has already raised nearly $90,000 in only a handful of months.

“Here in Burnaby we have a very active and generous community that is eager to be more involved with Burnaby Hospital’s great work,” said Chris Dong, the CAS vicechair. “We have already received tremendous support through local organizations and community groups, private donors, and even youth who have volunteered their time at events. It’s been a wonderful experience bringing our

community together, and we look forward to even greater achievements in the future.”

Burnaby City Councillor and founder of CAS, James Wang, notes that the early success of the new initiative can help foster continued growth.

“The members of CAS want to be an inspiration; to show other members of the community how they can play a direct and vital role in the health of people in Burnaby,” said Wang. “It also allows the foundation to learn more about potential donor interests and priorities, as well as identify opportunities for the foundation to support local Chinese events and celebrations.”

It’s a unique time for the foundation as it looks ahead to its 40th anniversary in 2022 and the community continues to change and shift, as health care and technology evolve simultaneously.

One of the many goals for the foundation currently is to fundraise for a variety of high-priority equipment needs; a key item at the moment is a second CT scanner to reduce the waitlist for patients, and meet rising demand. Other areas of focus include funds for a mental health and substance use zone to address the growing mental health crisis, and continued outreach into the community to improve health care at all levels.

Foundation CEO Kristy James notes that the enthusiasm and generosity of their volunteers makes all the difference and the new program is a great example of community leadership.

“Our Chinese Ambassador Society, made up of passionate volunteers, supports Burnaby Hospital Foundation because they understand that health is the most fundamentally important aspect of any prosperous community,” she said. “They want their fellow citizens to understand that while there are many worthy causes, supporting community health care – and particularly Burnaby Hospital – is the best way to make a direct impact for hundreds of thousands of people every year.”

“People think bamboo is eco-friendly because it grows really quickly,” says Byron Saracoglu of Metrotown Floors + Interiors. “But there is a lot of glue used in putting the bamboo sheets together; and it also travels far. On top of that, Bamboo might have to be replaced sooner than other woods, and when it does, it’s just going into the landfill.”

article continues below

For Saracoglu, health, comfort and safety of his customers are his priorities, so he is very selective in the companies he deals with and learns everything he can about how the products are made.

Europe has higher emission standards than in Canada, for example, so Metrotown Floors + Interiors imports European flooring as part of its product line.

Here are some of the factors Saracoglu advises his clients to keep in mind when they’re thinking about choosing eco-friendly products:

Distance: How far does the product travel? Local products are “greener” because less fuel is used in the supply chain. Emission standards: Does it come from a region that has strict emission standards, such as Europe or California? Toxins:Is it made with a lot of glue, such as plywood, laminates, synthetic carpets and other glue-based products? The glue might be made with formaldehyde, which is toxic in high doses. Durability: Is it long-lasting? Bamboo and cork floors are considered “green” because they are easily grown in large quantities, but they are also softer, which means they will have to be replaced sooner. Tile and stone are often a better solution due to their durability. Use of natural resources:Most man-made carpets, such as nylon and polyester, are oil-based, using non-renewable resources. Wool is a hypo-allergenic, natural alternative. Dyes and treatments:If the carpet has been coloured, was the dye natural? Cost: Often people go for a cheaper product without thinking how long it will last. If it has to be thrown into landfill in five years, it’s not very sustainable. A durable hardwood floor might be more expensive, but it’s far greener in the long run.

Eco-friendly flooring is not hard to find; you just need to know where to look and the right questions to ask.

“Our practice is very client-centric,” he says, “and we work hard to make sure every client is wowed, every time.”

With a background in both the financial services and law, Mr. Oduoza chose real estate transactions as a preferred area of service for his small Burnaby law firm.

“I was the Vice President of a major financial institution,” he says, “and as a licensed lawyer with a Business background, I can appreciate complexities of real estate transactions from both business angles and from point of law.”

“Real estate can be a complex business,” he notes, “At the centre of any real estate transaction are loan and collateral agreements. It’s important that documents are accurately prepared and filed. There are deadlines to be adhered to, and missing those deadlines could be disastrous for both the client and the financial institution.”

With his experience as both a lender and a lawyer, Mr. Oduoza believes he understands the psychology of both parties.

“At Vincent Mark Law Office,” he says, “we understand the needs and requirements of both parties. This includes the loan and collateral agreements and the property transfer documents. My background helps me in any real estate transaction, whether for residential or commercial purchases or sales.”

Believing that communication is the key to the successful outcome of any transaction, Mr. Oduoza makes sure that all parties, and especially his clients, are kept updated on the steps of every transaction.

Mr. Oduoza and his colleagues at Vincent Mark Law Office offer initial consultation for potential clients seeking advice on any kind of real estate transaction.

“We’re back to communication,” he laughs. “Before entering into a real estate transaction, we invite clients to come and meet us, explore out skills and competences, and discover how we can help them.”

""With so few vacancies in the Lower Mainland, it’s even harder because landlords have so many applicants they usually don’t choose to rent to people who have struggled with homelessness.""

Through a program called A Key of Her Own, EFry helps women who have been homeless for more than six months or who are repeat shelter users, to access housing. Part of a federal government initiative called Housing First, the program also supports women in becoming successful long term tenants and connecting to local community supports.

article continues below

The program is making a significant difference in the lives of women struggling with homelessness.

“I would have been lost without this support,” one woman writes on her program evaluation form. “I now feel stable both in my housing and emotionally. It has improved my life dramatically. I now have hope that I can obtain my goals.”

A significant portion of A Key of Her Own clients are seniors or mothers with young children. The first step in supporting vulnerable women is getting to know them.

""During our intake process, we ask questions to prompt each woman to tell her story,"" says Susan. ""When women have been traumatized, they have a hard time with trust so they might not openly say, “I have health issues” but based on their answers, we can usually figure out what struggles they’re facing.”

""A Key of Her Own is more than just finding a woman a place to live,” says Susan. “We provide ongoing support for up to two years that greatly improves a women’s ability to deal with common barriers such as hoarding, mental health issues, physical issues or addiction.

""For example, we have clients who, without help, wouldn't remember to pay their rent on time and find themselves being evicted as a result. We meet with women on an ongoing basis, once a week, twice a week, whenever they need support in their community or in their home. By doing this we can help deal with the issues as they come up rather than after they have become a crisis.”

Most women connect with A Key of Her Own through referrals from community agencies, EFry drop-in centres or EFry’s shelters.

“It is very rewarding speaking to women who now have a home of their own and a life they are proud of,” says Susan.

Rob Uppal first started working at White Spot at the age of 13. In 1994, when the business started franchising, he saw a good opportunity to get involved with a company he enjoyed working for.

“When I first became a franchisee, I was working day and night. It was a lot of hours, but it felt good to see the results of all the work I was putting into it,” Uppal says.

Since then he has been running the Metrotown White Spot franchise for 26 years.

Uppal feels the longevity of the restaurant says a lot about the brand and the relationship B.C. locals have with the restaurant.

“We treat our guests the way we’d expect to be treated. With genuine and friendly hospitality,"" Uppal says.

With 91 years of B.C. born business under their belt, Uppal thinks the beauty of White Spot is that many of their guests have grown with them.

The restaurant menu caters to diner’s morning, noon and night with a strong emphasis on locally sourced fresh produce.

“Our fresh Kennebecfries are grown right here in Delta,” Uppal says.

Famous stars like Michael Bublé and Michael J. Fox have also praised their burgers, and even the Prime Minister is a fan.

The beauty of the Kingsway location is its accessibility, which is situated just a few blocks away from the busy hub of the Metrotown mall. With over 55 parking stalls available, front and back, Uppal thinks nobody else on Kingsway can match what they offer their customers. The restaurant can seat 200 guests and has an outdoor patio and a large lounge area for customers to watch the latest sporting events.

“We understand that everyone in the world today is chasing youth—that in the moment, we tend to think we will live forever,” says Liina McNeil, the counsellor at Burnaby Hospice Society. “We’re trying to show people that if they can understand their predicament, they can deal with it better.”

In its 30 years of service in the not-for-profit sector, Burnaby Hospice Society has helped thousands of families in the local community through the end-of-life journey, supporting individuals in palliative, hospice or bereaved states along the way.

But for Burnaby Hospice Society, the biggest challenge rests not in helping families overcome grief but in seeing people take the first step, says McNeil.

“Quite often people are too shy to ask for help,” says McNeil, who is quick to point out that Burnaby Hospice Society’s new seed grant initiative, made possible by the BC Centre for Palliative Care, is designed to educate families on the end-of-life process.

“When things change,” she says, “we end up juggling a lot of different feelings and needs. And because it’s typically our first time having to deal with something like this, we’re completely unskilled at it.”

According to McNeil, the best thing to do in that situation is to talk about it and ask for help.

“Just do it,” she says to anyone who is thinking of reaching out. “There are others who have been through the end-of-life process before—and they can help.”

The drawback? Price: The preconception is that anything made just for you must be substantially more expensive than an off-the-peg product.

DiamondNet, a 40-year-old family business, is turning that idea on its head by providing bespoke jewellery at wholesale prices. How it works: Visit the company’s downtown Vancouver office. There, you can check out all of the brand’s inventory – and it’s a lot. “We have hundreds of stones at any given moment, where a jewellery store might have five or 10,” says owner Felix Bockstette. “We can line them up in front of you so you see what the different colours, clarity grades, cuts and sizes look like. It’s a unique experience in Vancouver.”

Once you’ve selected your stone, you share your design with the team – inspiration can come from photos or even a sketch you’ve made yourself. DiamondNet’s master goldsmiths and jewel setters will turn your idea to reality. “We create a lot of custom engagement rings, but we can also make bracelets, necklaces and other custom jewellery featuring gemstones too, and we have a selection of ready-made jewellery too,” says Bockstette. “Everything is sold at wholesale pricing, so the experience really is very affordable.”

You don’t miss out on the usual protections and guarantees of buying retail. All diamonds are sourced ethically, in accordance with the Kimberley Process, and from sources that are members of the professional diamond trade. There’s a refund policy, repair and servicing, and if you want to upgrade to a larger diamond, you can trade yours in and get 100 per cent of the value back. Most of all, you still get the care and experience you’d receive from a retailer. “We’re not a big corporation – we’re a family business and so we’re approachable, accommodating, and build relationships with our customers,” says Bockstette. “It’s all about creating a stress-free, hassle-free experience that delivers something unique, perfectly tailored to you.”

“We love to talk to people in the five years leading up to retirement, because a lot of decisions that people make in those five years can have a significant impact on financial outcomes and cash flow.”

article continues below

Sea Glass Wealth Advisory Group is part of Harbourfront Wealth Management and offers investment planning and goal setting for the retirement years, whether retirement occurs as planned or earlier than expected.

“Envisioning what you want your retirement to look like,” Tracey explains, “is one of the things we do when we discuss your investment portfolio.”

Tracey and her colleagues, Kristina Thomas and Sheryl Thomas, have found that retirement tends to come in two waves. First, there’s usually lots of travel. After a few years, clients tend to settle down and find rewarding things to do, such as volunteer work.

“Retirement always seems to cost a lot in the beginning, when we’re living our dreams of being able to travel more,” Tracey notes, “and then again at the end, when medical expenses become a worry. One of the questions we get asked most often is ‘will I outlive my money?’ We identify all the sources of income, including equity in the home, and try to give clients peace of mind about the financial aspects of retirement.”

Those income sources can be government and private pensions, personal savings as well as equity in their home.

“If people decide not to downsize,” Tracey says, “part of the process is to identify all the possible solutions to unlock the equity in your home. After identifying the options, we analyze the client’s situation and formulate a personalized recommendation.”

Flexibility is key, as is building liquidity into a plan.

“Don’t lock yourself into a situation that you can’t change,” Tracey advises. “We need to build flexibility and liquidity into your plan in order to take care of any unforeseen circumstances.”

Since that time, George Lee Law Corporation has grown to include four lawyers and a full support team that boasts a long, successful track record of assisting immigrants and investors from Asia through a full spectrum of legal issues.

Over the years, George Lee Law Corporation has been listed as the Best Chinese Law Firm in Vancouver and voted as Top 10 Best for Family Law, Immigration Law and Criminal Defense in Burnaby, BC on Yelp.ca.

It was also voted as Top 3 “Best Immigration Lawyers in Burnaby, BC” on ThreeBestRate.ca.

In 2016, George Lee Law Corporation was awarded the Most Innovative Law Firm in Canada by the Acquisition International Magazine based in U.K., and won the ACQ Global Awards 2016 for Canada (BC) Regional Family Law Firm of the Year and Canada (BC) Regional Immigration Law Firm of the Year.

“Three important factors differentiate us from other practices in Burnaby,” George says. “First, we are located in the community, not downtown. Second, we speak a variety of languages including English, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Korean. And third, we devise flat rate legal fee arrangements.”

George explains that the last point is important, because Asian clients are unfamiliar with the hourly fee rate structure prevalent in Canada.

“The hourly rate system has been passed along from the British legal system,” George says. “Clients in general and Asian people, in particular, don’t like it. They like the certainty of knowing what their legal fees are going to be. Even if it’s a complicated or lengthy case, we can offer a flat fee for each stage of the litigation process.”

George and his team at George Lee Law Corporation specialize in dealing with issues involving Asian countries and their citizens. He’s aware that the legal system in Canada is radically different from that in Asia.

“China, for example, does not have a legal system like ours,” he notes. “The evidence rules are totally different. Clients come to us because they don’t understand the rules here. They find it difficult to locate a lawyer who is fluently bilingual and who understands the laws and the cultures of both countries. That’s why clients retain us.”

Mr. Oduoza is the founder and principal lawyer with Vincent Mark Law Firm in Burnaby and welcomes family law issues.

“Family is very important to me,” he says. “As a member of the Catholic faith, I obviously have a bias against divorce and I disclose this to my clients right away. However, if there is no way to save the marriage or both parties are adamant that divorce is the answer, I can help with the technicalities. But I believe in mediation and communication first and foremost.”

article continues below

As part of his mediation training, Mr. Oduoza realized the importance of trying to reach a mutually agreeable informal agreement rather than escalating issues to the courts.

“If the issues between the parties are very big,” he says, “we go back to the beginning and look for a constant. With both parties consenting, we may mediate, talking first to one, then the other, and then both together. Whatever the issue is, very often it’s too small to destroy what they have, particularly if it’s been a long relationship. But if divorce is inevitable, so be it.”

Mediation is particularly important, Mr. Oduoza believes, when children are involved.

“Then, we are no longer talking about the lives and wishes of two adults. Children get caught up in a situation over which they have no control and for which they are not responsible. This can have very far-reaching implications for the children. Whatever the issue, whatever the outcome, we want to facilitate communication between the parties and reconcile differences. We’ve found that for about 75 percent of our clients, we can avoid going to court. It’s a very good success rate.”

His legal background and training has also prepared Mr. Oduoza for communicating with other legal representatives.

“Sometimes,” he explains, “both parties do not want to use the same legal representative. At Vincent Mark Law, we can help by representing our client and discussing the issue with the other party’s legal representative. It’s a similar process to mediation, but with an extra layer. We still believe that we can help facilitate a satisfactory outcome even when working with other lawyers or representatives.”

“Advance fee loans, the second riskiest scam in Canada for 2019, continues to wreak havoc for B.C. residents in a financial bind because of the pandemic,” according to the BBB, which is warning consumers, who may be urgently trying to acquire funds, to be on “high alert” to avoid losing money and exposing their personal information.

article continues below

The BBB says that the reports its received from victims across the province show consumers are extremely susceptible to the scam.

As part of the scam, the BBB says consumers may receive an email or phone call, or – as in the case of more recent reports to the bureau’s Scam Tracker – a pop-up ad online or find a website while searching for a loan company.

In this con, scammers disguised as loan brokers and other lending institutions advertise and promise loans to those in a financial bind. The loan, which is guaranteed regardless of credit history, comes with upfront charges labelled as “taxes,” “insurance” or “processing fees.”

However, when the charges are paid, the loan never materializes and the applicant is left with larger debts. The BBB says that requiring advance fees for loans is illegal in Canada

“Typically, the scammers will ask you to pay a fee for a seemingly legitimate reason,” said Karla Laird, the BBB’s manager for community and public relations.

“Oftentimes, they require that payment to be made by wire transfer, bitcoin or some other hard-to-recover method. However, once the fee is paid, the phony loan company stops communication and the consumer cannot get a refund.”

Vancouver man loses nearly $1,500

In one instance of the scam, which was reported to the BBB, a Vancouver resident lost nearly $1,500 to a company he found online with an Ontario address on its website.

The company told the Vancouver man his loan was approved for $10,000 at the rate of seven per cent for four years, however, the company needed a three-month advance payment in order to release the funds – a total of $718.

The health authority added the outbreak of C. difficile to its list of current outbreaks on July 14.

article continues below

According to Health Canada, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes mild to severe diarrhea and intestinal conditions like pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the colon). C. difficile is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitals and long-term care facilities in Canada, as well as in other industrialized countries.

C. difficile bacteria and their spores are found in feces. People can get infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with feces, and then touch their mouth. Healthcare workers can spread the bacteria to their patients if their hands are contaminated.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and abdominal pain/tenderness.

For healthy people, C. difficile does not pose a health risk. The elderly and those with other illnesses or who are taking antibiotics, are at a greater risk of infection.

Fraser Health asks all visitors to use our hand hygiene stations when they enter and exit its facilities, particularly if there is a reported outbreak.

If you have any of the following, please do not visit at this time:

Vomiting or diarrhea

Cough or flu-like symptoms

Fever

Rash

If you are visiting someone who is located on an outbreak unit, visitors may be limited to two people at a time. Fraser Health asks that you do not visit other patient rooms or common areas on the unit such as the lounge and patient kitchenette. It also recommends you don’t visit public areas in the hospital such as the cafeteria and gift shop.",[]

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

Sedation may be right for you,[],,"It’s not uncommon for people to feel anxious prior to visiting the dentist. For many, fear of the dentist’s chair started in early childhood when everything about the dentist was unfamiliar. For others, it’s tied to a longer, more involved procedure they require, such as wisdom teeth extraction or dental implant placement.

If you count yourself among those who fear the dentist’s chair, you can relax. Sedation dentistry is a safe and reliable way to ease both fear and discomfort.

“Oral sedation is very safe,” explains Dr. Karim Lalani of Madison Centre Family Dental in Burnaby, which offers state-of-the-art sedation dentistry. “The patient’s vital signs are monitored carefully and the patient can freely communicate with us the whole time.”

In fact, the patient doesn’t lose consciousness during the procedure.

“The patient will feel sleepy but they maintain their normal reflexes,” says Dr. Lalalni. “It’s a great way to allow patients to relax. And it makes the procedure less stressful on the body and mind.”

Dr. Lalani, who operates six Family Dental Centres locations throughout the Lower Mainland, says patients often find that procedures end up feeling easier than expected.

“With oral sedation, they can let us know if they have pain,” he says. “What’s more, patients tend to feel well rested after, and a lot of times they are pleasantly surprised when we tell them it’s over.”

For situations that require a stronger level of sedation or for those who find that the oral method isn’t effective, Madison Centre Family Dental has a practitioner that specializes in intravenous sedation. According to Dr. Lalani, patients who have been sedated intravenously tend to feel a lot better after procedures such as wisdom teeth extractions.

With sedation options available to virtually everyone (provided there are no underlying health issues) there is no reason to let fear stand in the way of good dental health!

“It’s very beautiful,” Knapman says. “It’s been updated, and it’s very stylish and comfortable.”

According to Knapman, the cemeteries are the most centrally located large properties in the Lower Mainland that still have space available.

“We certainly get a lot of people from Burnaby because they’ve grown up around us and they know us,” Knapman says. “But we get people from all over.”

Both cemeteries are also conveniently located next to the funeral homes, he adds.

The funeral homes honour events such as Mother’s Day and Father’s Day by holding an open house where families can light a candle and gather in the reception lounge for coffee and tea before visiting the cemetery. On Remembrance Day, the funeral homes offer small Canadian flags for those who wish to place them on veterans’ graves.

The funeral homes belong to the Dignity Memorial network. Dignity Memorial®’s parent company, Service Corporation International, received the J.D. Power Award for its dedication to service excellence this year.

While some choose to relocate to cities like Victoria, Kelowna or Prince George, many others wish to remain in the Lower Mainland to stay close to their jobs, families and friends. One of the most attractive and yet under-sought places is New Westminster. With five SkyTrain stations servicing the city, New West is a quick and easy commute from the downtown Vancouver core. The city itself is extremely family-oriented, with over 45 parks, 12 schools, the Royal Columbian Hospital and several post-secondary institutions. The steady influx of families has shown that New West is the new place to be.

Parents want to ensure that their children’s schooling needs will be met. They will be reassured to learn that New West is home to a growing private school with a new facility being built just steps away from Braid SkyTrain Station. Urban Academy, established in 2001, is building a new, larger campus for students in Junior Kindergarten through to Grade 12. The new building will be five storeys tall and have over 50,000 square feet of space for students to learn, play and explore. Taking advantage of its convenient location, just steps from Hume Park, the school serves families from all over New West, the Tri-Cities, Burnaby and beyond.

Says Cheryle Beaumont, Head of School at Urban Academy: “The community has really responded to and enjoyed having a secular private school available to them as a choice. The new school in particular makes it really accessible for residents of Port Moody and Coquitlam and makes it easy for New Westminster residents to attend as well.”

Moving to a new community can be a challenge, especially if you don’t know anyone. Parents who are looking to get involved in the community are encouraged to participate by way of the parent volunteer program. Urban Academy’s various committees, including the Parent Auxiliary, ensure a strong conduit of community, allowing parents to get to know each other, while banding together to benefit the school and the children.

Beaumont continues: “All of our parents commit 35 hours of volunteer time to the school community every year. They can do that volunteer service in many ways. One committee is parent auxiliary where they provide services to the school like the hot lunch program and uniform sales. They also do an amazing job every year of a great community gala.”

Anyone with fears about beating rush hour traffic after work to pick up their child from school can also rest easy. Urban Academy’s Out of School Care program runs from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. throughout the school year, allowing parents and caregivers the ultimate flexibility when it comes to balancing work and home responsibilities. For families who are unable to drive or take transit, the school also offers a morning bus service with multiple pick-up locations running from North West Burnaby to the school.

Hospitalized on three occasions, the 76-year old Coquitlam resident is grateful to Royal Columbian Hospital for helping her manage her illness with medications and continue to live independently.

She was first hospitalized in the late 1960s, when she had what she describes as a nervous breakdown. “I had anxiety attacks. They were bad, and I went to see my doctor,” Joyce remembers. “He said I should be in the hospital.”

article continues below

She was diagnosed with schizophrenia and given a prescription that Joyce says helped for more than 40 years. But then, around the time her husband passed away, Joyce says the medication stopped working.

She ended up in Royal Columbian Hospital’s emergency department, where she was admitted to the Sherbrooke Centre. Psychiatrist Dr. Hem Phaterpekar put her on a new medication.

“Unfortunately, that is a reasonably common occurrence, where medication after some time may not have as good an effect as it did before,” explains Dr. Phaterpekar, who has a specialty in geriatric psychiatry. “Also, when a person ages, his or her body change significantly in its metabolism.”

Three years after that short stay, Joyce was again brought to emergency. “My podiatrist had come to my home, and she realized there was something that wasn’t right,” says Joyce.

This time she was admitted to the Sherbrooke Centre for a month. Her medication dosage was adjusted again. “The staff was so caring, and that made a big difference,” she says.

After being discharged, she followed up with the local community mental health centre and is now using her family doctor as her first point of contact.

“Our goal is always to have short hospitalizations where people can begin to recover,” explains Royal Columbian Hospital Psychiatry department head Dr. Anson Koo, “and where we can establish appropriate services and care in the community so people can continue their recovery in the community.”

These days, Joyce says she feels good. “I can cope. I am out almost every day. I socialize. I’ve got lots of good friends,” she says.

“We start by telling clients to put the issues of profit and money aside,” he says. “When you do the right thing, money will come. I want to understand your business objectives, values, your ethos.”

article continues below

Business objectives, values and ethos are important to Mr. Oduoza. Graduating with a degree in law in Nigeria and then originally called to the Bar in Ontario, Mr. Oduoza also has a degree in executive leadership from the prestigious Harvard Business School.

“I want to know what is important to you,” he continues. “For example, if you tell me that you feel very strongly about family, and you have a spouse or a grown up child, I will suggest that you incorporate your business. That way, if anything happens to you, your business can exist in perpetuity. Of course, we would also need to discuss the tax and cost implications and these may affect your business structure.”

Sole proprietorships offer the flexibility of operating on your own with no interference, but lack the perpetual continuity of a corporation. “When you pass on,” says Mr. Oduoza, “you will have no control over how the business carries on and who runs it.”

After a discussion about the structure of an enterprise, a consultation with Mr. Oduoza will typically turn to other practical matters.

“Is the client going to have a website?” he asks. “If so, perhaps they need help with legal disclaimers on the site or how to comply with privacy legislation, local licenses, registrations, trademarks, etc. There is so much more to starting a business than just hanging a shingle outside your door and welcoming customers. We can guide the client in the right direction.”

Mr. Oduoza recommends visiting Vincent Mark Law Office for an initial consultation before deciding to proceed.

“The initial consultation is very important,” he says. “That’s when we discover the client’s needs and how to meet them.”

It’s not just a great night out – the money raised goes to an incredible cause. “All proceeds go directly to support and raise awareness of Burnaby Hospice Society and its hospice palliative care and bereavement support programs,” says Lee.

“Proceeds will also go to expanding our services as there is an urgent need for more volunteers in care homes where many seniors are alone and die alone. With the support we receive, the Burnaby Hospice Society can continue our critical work of providing compassionate care to individuals during the end-of-life journey and bereavement support to their families and friends.”

The flagship property of Gateway Casinos & Entertainment, the 300,000-square foot facility includes nine distinctive food and beverage outlets, the Delta Hotel and Conference Centre with 189 hotel rooms, six luxury suites and over 12,000 square feet of meeting space, along with a casino complete with 64 table games, 11 poker tables, 1,200 slot machines, and VIP gaming areas.

All told, it’s an all-encompassing destination for food, gaming, entertainment, travellers, and business that has been garnering rave reviews on every front since it opened. And with the recent completion of $15 million in upgrades, Grand Villa is making a milestone statement as it marks its first decade in operation.

“I can’t believe it’s been ten years already. The venue and offerings have evolved so much and continue to develop as we keep pace with the market,” proudly states Stan Ma, assistant general manager. “I have seen a lot of impressive growth and with that continuous upgrades and additions. For example, the addition of CHOW Lucky Noodle Bar, our flagship restaurant Atlas Steak + Fish, and our expanded poker rooms and VIP gaming.”

These significant investments are all part of the Grand Villa’s mantra of providing the most unique ‘resort and entertainment experience’ in the Lower Mainland. Whether it’s for a night of live entertainment, a dining occasion, or mixing business and pleasure, it’s a one-stop complex covering all your needs.

“We get really excited when we consistently receive compliments like: I can’t believe I’ve never been here before, this is such a beautiful property and I had a great time,” said Ma, noting that they often get feedback about the variety of options, the customer service, and attention to detail, with visitors saying it’s on par with Las Vegas.

That’s a sign that the company is achieving its goals, but they’re never content to rest on success – there’s always new ways to innovate and improve.

“We try to express excellence in everything that we do, as our goal is to be the premier entertainment destination in the Lower Mainland,” he added. “To do that, we strive to go above and beyond the expectations of our guests and most importantly to listen carefully to what our guests are asking us for.”

That requires a committed team and Ma describes the staff of more than 1,200 as incredibly dedicated and focused on shaping the guest experience.

“Their authentic commitment each and every day is what drives our success,” he said.

Ma himself began with Gateway nearly 20 years ago and has diligently progressed through more senior positions, from table games dealer to his current role.

“I like to use myself as an example of Gateway’s commitment of investing in their people – I never imagined there would be so many incredible opportunities,” he said. “The amazing thing is that I am only one of many similar stories within the organization.”

Ma says he encourages anyone who’s never been to Grand Villa to come experience the resort.

“This amazing but somewhat best-kept-secret has something special for everyone,” he says, adding those options run the gamut from a romantic dinner or a glass of wine, to gaming or live entertainment, dancing and more.

“Come in and let our team pamper you,” he said. “Grand Villa is the place to be.”

The central location off Highway 1, along with free covered parking in attached parkades, make it an easy choice for local visitors and travellers alike.

This could be new immigrants, single moms and dads, or people who might be in a low place right now. We help them find that connection and open doors.”

The Burnaby Neighbourhood House “South House” is pleased to have a home in a purpose built facility in Metrotown. The new space was arranged through a density bonus arrangement with the City of Burnaby. Although the space is provided at a 50% discount off of the market rent it is expensive to operate and each year the Neighbourhood House must fundraise close to $100,000 to support its core operations and keep its doors open. Programs are operated with funding from provincial and federal government in addition to United Way and several other cooperate foundations in the form of grants. In addition, the not-for-profit charity hosts key fundraisers such as its annual Diamond Ball gala every February. The themed event includes an auction, dinner, show, and diamond draw.

Fundraising is key to keeping the doors open in South and now even more so at their new location in North where the organization is looking for space to relocate the North House as its current location is being developed in the Fall of 2016. “We pay special attention to make sure people find what they need at the Neighbourhood House,” says Beck. “We believe the House belongs to the community.”

Every year, the Diamond Ball gala seeks volunteers to help organize the event and business sponsors to provide financial support. In turn, the Neighbourhood House promotes its sponsors through advertising during the event and community referrals throughout the year.

Other fundraising includes an annual raffle whereby participants and supporters help to sell tickets. At the North House a committee of volunteers have committed to organizing an annual IQ event which is a foot race through the Burnaby Heights that provides a day of fun and community building while raising funds to operate the North House.

“As the Neighbourhood House does not receive any core funding, much of these funds go to basic operating costs and sustaining programs that are severely underfunded but very important supports within our community,” says Beck. “Our daycare operations are fee based program as we have professional staff working within them. We strive to offer quality care at an affordable rate. However, if there’s a family struggling to pay the fee, the funds we raise allow us to offer them an internal subsidy. This is very important for us to do as affordability is often a barrier to access.”

BOSS Business Centres primarily has five types of clients, according to Julian, such as the professional, the entrepreneur, the counsellor, the satellite office and the non-profit or government agency. Each of these clients has different needs – the counsellor or therapist needs comfortable furniture to meet with clients, dimmed lighting and a quiet and private environment, whereas the professional needs the full range of high-end office support and services to run their business.

That’s one reason why posAbilities, an agency providing services to those with developmental disabilities and their families, has developed a special program called LINK!, to address a possible shortfall in education.

article continues below

“We recognized there were a lot of questions around sexual health and education and there wasn’t anywhere for people to go get this information for youth and adults with diverse abilities,” says Becky Roth, clinical supervisor and sexual health educator with posAbilities’ Laurel Behaviour Support Services.

Last April, staff began exploring ways of delivering vital information on sex, sexuality and sexual health to groups and individuals, as well as their families and caregivers. And last September a curriculum was established.

LINK! is comprised of two mandatory sessions and eight electives. The mandatory sessions include subjects such as public vs. private, anatomy, consent, the law and peoples’ rights, which provide a foundation to address more specific topics in the electives.

“Those include discussions about online safety and pornography, safer sex practices, learning about contraceptives and STIs … the list goes on, making it relevant for people and their particular situations,” Roth says.

“We were finding that, previously, people didn’t really know what questions to ask, so they weren’t getting the information they needed to explore their sexuality and relationships of an intimate nature,” Roth says. “As a result, we were also seeing folks engaging in inappropriate sexual behaviour, as well, due to a lack of education.

“We often work with people who have been, or who could be in really vulnerable situations.”

For example, Roth says that a recent training participant shared that he didn’t know that “maybe” was not the same as “yes” when it comes to consent, and that he is more comfortable speaking to women since taking the course.

“There just weren’t a lot of positive outcomes because people were not getting the proper information to make informed choices,” Roth adds.

Now, that’s all changing, thanks to LINK!.

“One overwhelming comment that kept coming up from people enrolled in LINK! was that they finally found an environment where they felt safe and comfortable to ask questions - questions about their bodies, about consent, what they should or shouldn’t do, and sexual practices,” Roth says.

Concurrently, assistance is provided for the families of those using LINK!

“We have adapted training for caregivers, staff and parents,” Roth says. “That way, if questions came up at home, or a support setting, caregivers or family would be better equipped to have a discussion or provide resources to get more information to help to navigate sexuality, which is a complex and involved topic in and of itself.”

Along with her colleagues, Kristina Thomas and Sheryl Thomas, Tracey offers personalized investment planning and goal setting advice to Sea Glass Wealth Advisory Group clients.

article continues below

An important part of those goals can be charitable giving. Tracey offers a few reasons why philanthropy can be a rewarding way to give back to the community while making sense to a financial plan.

1. Reaping the tax benefits

“There are many ways to donate that are beneficial from a tax point of view,” Tracey explains. “and this forms part of our planning process. Donating securities that have appreciated in value, for example, can be a way to get some tax relief on the capital gain.”

A point to keep in mind, though, is the capacity of the organization chosen to be a recipient of the donation.

“Some charities obviously have more ability to accept sophisticated instruments as donations than others,” Tracey notes. “It’s important to keep the organization’s need s and resources in mind too.”

2. Supporting a cause you care about

“At Sea Glass Wealth Advisory Group, planning for philanthropy means matching our client’s values to a charity’s mission,” Tracey says. “First, we identify a number of charities that our client might find interesting and rewarding. There may be several and after discussion with the client, we narrow it down to two or three. That’s when the research comes in.”

The research involves making sure that the organization is a reputable non-profit with a proven track record of achieving goals that the client finds important.

3. Establishing a Private Giving Foundation

“Another option that people often don’t think about is a Private Giving Foundation,” says Tracey. “It’s a vehicle designed for donating to a number of charities over a longer time frame.”

Setting up a Private Giving Foundation requires just $10,000 capital to start, and it often involves the whole family.

“We’ve seen clients set up a Private Giving Foundation and have their kids and even grandkids sit on the foundation’s board, helping to make the donating decisions. It’s a wonderful way to involve the younger generation and give them the philanthropic experience together with learning new skills.”

What is overfunding?

article continues below

According to Bridge to Prosperity, a unique business and wealth management firm servicing Vancouver, The Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island, when you over-fund a life insurance policy you deposit above and beyond what your regular premium is supposed to be, up to a predetermined ceiling amount.

These extra amounts will accumulate within the policy, tax-deferred, and create a cash surrender value, which will immediately enhance your estate’s worth.

In addition, you can use the accumulated funds for any purpose, such as going on vacation, buying a car or even supplementing your current or future income, without potentially having to pay these funds back.

This strategy should be considered when developing a comprehensive financial plan for you and your loved ones as it provides for:

Increased - tax-free - inheritance for beneficiaries when personally owned

The ability to transfer accumulated corporate retained earnings to beneficiaries with minimal tax consequences when corporately owned

Possible non-taxable withdrawals in the event of critical illness, disability or loss of independence

The ability to choose investment structure and allocation

""It's just not true. Those temporary baby teeth are very important because they hold a space for the permanent teeth and help guide them into the right position. If the baby teeth are lost prematurely, it can lead to the adult teeth shifting forward and become crowded.""

article continues below

According to Dr. Katz, another reason to make sure your little one visits the dentist on a regular basis is for the early detection of cavities.

""Cavities are caused by bacteria,"" explains Dr. Katz. ""Bacteria doesn't just cause damage on one tooth—it affects multiple teeth and areas in the mouth. This is especially true for children, because they're not always as diligent about dental home care as their parents would like.""

The result is that cavities begin to spread around the mouth as the bacteria gain a foothold.

""The first permanent teeth erupt at about six years old,"" Dr. Katz says. ""Between the ages of six and about 12, the permanent teeth are sharing the arch with baby teeth. If the baby teeth develop cavities that are not restored promptly then the decay can spread to the permanent tooth. The key to avoiding this situation is to instill good dental habits in your children and to introduce them to the dentist early.

""If we see children regularly, we can nip this issue in the bud and put a filling in the baby tooth in a timely way so that the cavity doesn't spread to other teeth,” says Dr. Katz. “We want kids to have as few problems as possible with their permanent teeth, because they need to keep them for the rest of their lives.""

Part of children's dental care is educating the parents.

""We explain to parents how they can help keep their kids' teeth healthy,"" says Dr. Katz, ""They're doing their best, giving fruit rollups instead of candy and fruit juice instead of soda. But there's still a lot of sugar in those items. Water down the fruit juice and control the amount of sticky fruit rollups a child eats. Or better yet, try to prevent your child developing a sweet tooth in the first place.""

Sound advice not only for teeth, but also for your child's overall general health.

With Invisalign, orthodontic patients receive clear plastic aligner trays that fit over the teeth and gently shift them over time. The trays can be popped in or out easily, and most people won’t even know you are wearing them. Best of all, the trays have little to no impact on speech.

article continues below

Dr. Karim Lalani of Madison Centre Family Dental in Burnaby is not only a big proponent of Invisalign, he uses the trays himself.

“From a lifestyle point of view, Invisalign doesn’t limit you at all,” he says. “You can eat whatever you want – you just pop out the trays. They are very discreet.”

Dr. Lalalni was so impressed with Invasalign, in fact, that he uses the advanced technology for his own teeth.

“People can’t even tell I am wearing them,” he says, “whereas with traditional braces, you’re announcing to the world, ‘I’m getting orthodontics.’ Those who choose Invisalign tend to be some of my happiest patients, because they see such good results.”

The Invisalign process begins with the creation of a 3D clinical model of the patient’s mouth using a state-of-the-art iTero digital scanner, which produces images the patient can see right away.

“As a dentist, I like the fact that with Invisalign, all the planning is done digitally,” says Dr. Lalani. “We can show the patient what the end result will be and even give them the chance to customize how their teeth will look. It’s a very interactive experience.”

According to Dr. Lalalni, the aligner trays are easy to clean and patients can brush and floss as they normally would, without having to worry about metal wires and brackets getting in the way. Invisalign is also great for athletes, who can simply remove their trays whenever they need to insert a protective mouth guard.

And posAbilities- which provides a broad range of services across the Lower Mainland to persons with developmental disabilities and their families - helps make those impactful connections.

Ten-year-old Gio Julian is proof of that. When he was younger, Gio was diagnosed with autism in his native Philippines, where he lived with his older brother, Gian, and was cared for by their grandparents.

The boys’ mom, Minette, had previously moved to Canada, settled and then reunited with her sons in 2017. Moving to a new country, new schools and a different way of life was a steep challenge for both boys, especially Gio. And Minette knew she needed some help for him to adjust, particularly in his social and eating behaviours.

So, after a short while on a waiting list to link up with a behavioural consultant from Laurel Behaviour Support Services, which operates under the umbrella of posAbilities, Kelly Riccardientered Gio and his family’s lives. The impact was far-reaching.

“Kelly was so good with Gio,” Minette said, adding the two connected well.

One of Kelly’s aims was to help improve Gio’s eating habits, developed by his well-meaning grandparents in the Philippines who allowed him to not stray from favourite foods that, by themselves, were not conducive to a healthy diet.

“Gio liked fried chicken, fries, and other types of meats all the time,” Minette said. “He didn’t want to eat vegetables and other healthier foods.”

Gio also preferred not to sit with the rest of the family at the dining table for meals, and his mom would feed him while he watched TV or played video games. Minette knew that had to change, and Kelly had a plan.

It was a rewards-based program called “First and Then” that tapped into Gio’s love of math.

Part of the process involved giving Gio a specific number of bites per meal to help him finish his new foods in a way he could relate to. After finishing a certain number of bites from his new dishes, Gio could then eat some of his favourite foods as a reward. It was a success.

“He is now eating with the rest of us at home and with his classmates at school, which provides him with regular opportunities to be included with his peers,” Minette said. “It’s been a wonderful change.”

So, how can you tell if Retirement Living is the right solution for you or your loved one? According to AgeCare’s Retirement Consultant, Joel Grigg, there are a few key questions that you should be asking:

· Are you struggling to keep up with household tasks - such as grocery shopping, cooking and cleaning?

· Are you feeling overwhelmed by the upkeep that your property requires?

· Do you feel isolated? Or struggle to socialize with friends and family?

· Are you passionate about maintaining your independence, but want the peace of mind that help is on hand if you need it?

“Retirement living at AgeCare Harmony Court Estate allow seniors to continue to live a socially active Retirement lifestyle, with the reassurance that support is there should they need it,” Joel says.

“Residents live in their own spacious private suites, surrounded by their own furnishings and decorated how they like. Meals, cleaning and other household chores are all taken care of, allowing them to save their energy for doing the things they love to do, helping to maintain a healthy mind, body and spirit.”

The answer sounds obvious right? But according to Stuart Lloyd, from Burnaby-based Lloyd Hearing Solutions, hearing aids do more than just help people to hear again. In fact, they have the power to help change lives.

As the owner of a family business that’s been serving the local community for more than 47-years, Stuart knows what he’s talking about. So aside from the obvious, we asked him to share just some of the ways that better hearing can change peoples’ lives.

1. Improve relationships - Communication is an essential part of any relationship, so it’s understandable that hearing loss can have a huge impact on our ability to relate to our family, friends and co-workers. Frustration is a common side effect of untreated hearing loss, and people often find that their relationships can begin to break down due to the stress involved with even the simplest of conversations.

Hearing aids can help you to rebuild those relationships. Whether they enable you to have intimate conversations with your loved ones again, share stories with friends, or simply hear your children laugh - getting your hearing back can put your relationship back on track.

2. Tackle depression - Studies have shown that people with hearing loss are more susceptible to social isolation and depression. Whether it’s through depression, frustration, or embarrassment, people with untreated hearing loss can cut themselves off from the people, places and activities that were once mainstays of their everyday lives.

These are all vital to maintaining good mental health, and a hearing aid can help you to become part of these conversations again and re-engage with your life.

3. Help at work - Work can be stressful enough at the best of times, now imagine what it must be like if you are suffering from hearing loss. What if you miss a crucial piece of information, or you have to ask a client or co-worker to continually repeat themselves? Your hearing problems could have a very real impact on workplace relationships, or even the success of the business itself.

Hearing aids can alleviate these issues however, helping to not only ensure that your existing professional relationships thrive but that you are able to continue to make new ones for years to come.

“I really think growing up [in Burnaby] made me well-rounded,” says Sharma. After being born and raised in Burnaby, Sharma made his way to SFU for a Kinesiology degree, and then to UBC to become a dentist. After graduating, he moved north to Yellowknife where he lived and worked for five years.

The small town allowed him the opportunity to practice dentistry in a hospital, jail and a private clinic setting, all of which he credits with making him a very experienced and diverse dental practitioner, as well as being able to help an underserved population of our country.

Now, Sharma is back in Burnaby for good, and has set up his own practice just five minutes away from the public library and community centre he used as a child. He says that a huge part of moving back to his hometown was to “give back to the community that raised me.”

Sharma says that with this in mind, he and several other health practitioners have joined forces to offer their services on the same block on Gamma Avenue – next to his dental office will be a medical clinic focusing on family medicine, internal medicine and cardiology, a pharmacy, as well as a daycare centre.

“Our whole model is holistic dental health, how your mouth connects to your body, and how the two interact and influence one another, so it made a lot of sense to be working with others offering similar services,” he says.

The different health care professionals will work cooperatively to make sure their patients get the wraparound care that they need and deserve. It is all part of Sharma's plan to help his community get healthier.

Technology is also a major part in his plan to get Burnaby in a healthier state.

The new dental clinic boasts the latest state-of-the-art instruments, including intraoral scanners that show 3D models of patients’ mouths (no more sticky, messy impressions), an oral cancer scanner, massaging dental chairs and 4K televisions.

Clients will also have a wide array of dental services from family dentistry to Invisalign braces to Botox, which is used for teeth grinding and clenching.

In order to get the community on board, he first has to meet its members. That's why Sharma and his staff have been hosting free barbeques outside of their office, as well as giving back to the community by partnering with a number of local charities.

“We work with the Companion Animal Advocacy and Rescue Effort Society and give money to that animal shelter each time we get a new patient,” he says.

Sharma also helps out the Burnaby Neighbourhood House, a non-profit that helps families who are new to Canada learn what resources are available, and how to get health care.

Overall, he is thrilled to be back home and helping out.

“I think Burnaby was a great place to grow up,” he says. “And now, it's an even better place to see patients.”

But home care isn’t just about medical care, in fact it’s as much about helping seniors keep their independence for longer.

“For us, senior home care is about caring, not just health care,” Susan and Wendy Scott from Nurse Next Door say. “In our experience, once a senior begins to lose their independence, their happiness starts to disappear too, so we do everything in our power to help keep them in their own home as long as they want to remain there and can so safely.”

article continues below

Here the Scott’s draw on their experience with seniors to share the four keys to happier aging.

1. Play: Seniors with a full dance card of hobbies and passions are much less likely to fall foul to the pitfalls of social isolation that we traditionally associate with old age. However for a variety of reasons seniors can find themselves drifting from passions that were once a key part of their lives. A good caregiver’s job involves helping seniors to continue the pursuit of their passions, helping them to maintain hobbies and interests that encourage them to remain active both socially and physically.

2. Connections and relationships: No matter what age we are, personal connections with our friends and families remain crucial to living happy and healthy lives. Research has shown that those people who maintain their interpersonal connections live longer than people who are isolated as they get older. As well as making us happy, maintaining these relationships can also impact our health, boosting things like our immune systems, lowering blood pressure and alleviating depression.

3. Learning: We’ve all heard the saying “It’s never too late to teach an old dog new tricks” but did you know the same applied to us humans too? Indeed ongoing learning, even in the later stages of our lives, has been widely proven to help boost health and longevity.

4. Travel and adventure: Whether it’s soaking up some Vitamin D on a pristine beach or venturing off of the beaten track, everyone has dreams of travelling. And these don't just stop as we start to get older. Many seniors have had to shelve their dreams and aspirations due to family commitments, work, or financial constraints. But those dreams never fade and just because you are getting older doesn’t mean that they cannot become a reality.

Kelly and his team at The Caterer can accommodate any meal and any dietary preference. Choose from the simplicity of a Chopped Egg Salad sandwich, excite the taste buds with the Vietnamese Port Bhai Mi, or pick the vegan Quinoa Falafel Wrap from the lunch menu. Salads, wraps, canapés, cheese and veggie platters as well as a variety of desserts are all on offer.

The key, according to Kelly, is the local ingredients.

""We only buy fresh ingredients,"" he says. ""I know every ingredient in everything we make. We make just about everything on site – our own salad dressings spices, sauces, everything.""

Classically trained in Ireland and France, Kelly has worked in prestigious restaurants and catering businesses all over the globe. The Caterer's menu selections have a distinct Asian influence, thanks to his time spent travelling in Indonesia and Asia.

""I love Asian ingredients and the different taste experiences you can put together from them,"" Kelly says.

In his first year in business The Caterer attracted more than 50 corporate clients.

""They give me more business,"" he says, ""and recommend me to other clients. People are comfortable with me because they know that I can plan a menu for them that will be healthy, fresh and delicious.""

In addition to corporate menu planning, The Caterer also supplies weddings, wedding showers, and buffet-style family events.

""We can cater to most dietary preferences,"" Chef Kelly says. ""I've travelled the world cooking for dietary needs of all kinds, so nothing is off the table. ""We can help you take your event to the next level with delicious gourmet food and exciting new flavours.""

In the Metro Vancouver area alone, over 44 million pounds of clothing were thrown out last year and sent to landfills. There, many of the items containing plastic will take anywhere from hundreds to thousands of years to decompose.

By way of contrast, Green Inspiration wants you to know just what happens when you deposit your used textiles in one of their green bins. Green Inspiration BC has over one hundred collection locations scattered around the Lower Mainland and Greater Victoria area. Last year, they diverted over 1,200 tonnes of clothing from landfills. ""Over 90 per cent of what we collect is recyclable,"" says Pavel Lalev, a manager with the company.

""Fifteen to twenty percent of it is resellable here in North America, and the rest goes to countries like Chile, Ukraine or Pakistan,"" he continues.

The best quality items are sent to thrift stores in those countries where they are sold to locals in need at affordable prices. The rest of the more worn items are given to non-profits, where they are distributed amongst those who are most in need. After this, the very small amount of clothing left over finds new life as rags, the stuffing of car seats, and many other repurposings.

Lalev notes that there are things you can do to make your clothing purchases more ecologically sound. Buy gently used or recycled clothing whenever possible, avoid purchasing clothing with plastic content (such as acrylic, nylon, spandex, and polyester, as it is harder to recycle) and repair clothing whenever you can. He adds that brand-new cotton and rayon are also not very eco-friendly, as cotton needs a lot of pesticides to be processed (think 1/3 a pound of pesticides per T-shirt), and rayon depends on clearing forests to grow bamboo. In this way, we can all help take care of our planet.

""It feels nice to be a part of something good,"" says Lalev. He notes that his company contributes each month to its local partners the Boys and Girls Club of South Coast BC and the BC/Yukon Command of the Royal Canadian Legion.

Still others are about creating a family legacy, or about seeing a vision come to life. For Jim Ball and his team at Reliance Insurance, it’s about all of that and more.

“I started at Hastings and Boundary in a little hole-inthe-wall office, 500 square feet, in 1985,” he said. “We’re still on Hastings – about 13 blocks east – but now we have our own building, 16,000 square feet, and more than 100 employees.”

The general insurance agency provides a spectrum of insurance products, including commercial insurance for a variety of businesses in the region; and home, automobile, and marine insurance.

The company has grown in part through building a rocksolid reputation for customer care, integrity and quality, but also through careful and strategic expansion.

“We’ve made 17 acquisitions over the years. I bought this building and we all came together here. This was always my dream, to have everyone under one roof.”

Ball calls Reliance a family business, and he means that in more ways than one – his own son and daughter are key figures in the company, but the sense of family extends to the whole team.

“We like to consider everyone who works here as part of the family. Many of our employees have been with us for well over 10 years, bringing a wealth of experience to our clients,” he said. “When you all work together for the same goal, with the same vision for what your company is about, that’s family. It’s important to me that Reliance continues to be a family business.”

Ball notes that the insurance industry, like so many other fields, is fast evolving to keep pace with technology and customer needs.

“This is the future,” he said. “E-commerce has and will change business in many ways and you have to always be changing to stay ahead of the curve.”

Regardless of the technology, Ball says it will always come down to people, on both sides of the desk – customer and staff.

“We have a team with a lot of knowledge and expertise, a wonderful group of people,” he said. “And our job is to take care of the customer, every time.”

When a situation occurs that requires an insurance claim – be it a flood or a house fire – the most important thing is to be able to give a customer peace of mind.

“When something happens, we want to be able to say: don’t worry, you’re covered,” he said. “Our motto is Protection Beyond Insurance®, and that sums it up.”

He says educating people about insurance is also important, as it’s something many people don’t think about until they need it. “We help people understand that insurance is really risk management – looking at ways to minimize your risk,” he said. “There are things you can’t insure against, like loss of reputation, but we may be able to educate and guide people to other resources that can help.”

Reliance has expansion operations in Ontario and Quebec, but the heart of the business is here in Burnaby – and they plan to keep it that way.

“This is a great community and we love it here,” he said. “The neighbourhood is wonderful, it’s central and many of our customers are Burnaby residents. This is our home for a long time to come.”

A plan of Kelly's is to highlight his local suppliers at his T-Bird Café to bring awareness to the rest of the community.

""I want to take a head shot of each of our suppliers and show them on the walls of the café with a little blurb that recommends them to our customers. I want to give back to the locals as much as they're giving to me. I plan on organizing a summer market and inviting all our suppliers. We'll stand shoulder to shoulder and say, 'Local is where it's at here!' We need to get that vibe created.""

Offering catering services for corporate, family, and wedding events, Kelly and his team at The Caterer make just about everything fresh on the premises.

""I know every ingredient in everything we make,"" he says. ""There are no preservatives. And I've travelled the world catering for different dietary preferences, so nothing is off the table. Just let us know what your preferences are.""

His passion for fresh, local food is only matched by Kelly's passion for teaching kids how to cook.

""My long-term plan is to open a cooking school in Burnaby with a conference space above it. There'll be a variety of rooms, but one will feature 10-12 cooking stations. I can see us inviting high school kids to come in and work for one week in the year and teaching them how to cook good, nutritious food.""

Indeed, a big part of Kelly's business is to support his local community in learning how to cook with the great flavour in local food.

""We've an abundance of farms between here and Abbotsford,"" he says. ""And we're hiring a cordon bleu trained chef to support us in setting up cooking classes in Burnaby, North Vancouver, and other local areas so the community can see and appreciate the fabulous food we have locally.""

729,burnabynow,https://www.burnabynow.com/standout/considering-dental-implants-dr-stuart-katz-discusses-the-process-1.2350156,Considering dental implants? Dr. Stuart Katz discusses the process,[],,"Gone are the days when your only option for replacing lost teeth was ill-fitting dentures. Although dental prostheses have come a long way since your grandmother's time, many people find dentures uncomfortable and difficult to wear.

One option is the dental implant. At his practice located in Burnaby Square, Dr. Stuart Katz offers the option of dental implants to his Burnaby and New Westminster patients.

article continues below

""The benefit of dental implants,"" explains Dr. Katz, ""is that you can have one or many. The procedure involves placing a small post, rather like a screw, made from titanium into the jawbone. Then we put an artificial tooth on top of it, if it's for a single tooth replacement. With 2 to 3 implants we can stabilize a lower denture that can often be difficult to wear. With 5 – 7 implants, you could conceivably have a full arch of replacement teeth.""

Dr. Katz is quick to add that the best approach is to make sure that you don't lose your teeth in the first place.

“There are subtle differences between natural teeth and implant supported teeth, but both serve to preserve the bone that surrounds the teeth. In most cases, a dental implant is the best way to replace a missing tooth.”

""No matter how good the implant or the dentures are, they're never as good as your own healthy teeth,” he says. “Teeth have ligaments attaching them to the bone. When you clench your teeth, for example, the teeth will move up and down supported by the ligament. Dental implants won't do that. The implant is screwed into the bone and it's fixed.""

To be a good candidate for dental implants, you should be in good overall health, with healthy gums with enough bone to support the implant. If you're lacking sufficient bone, a bone graft might be needed.

""It used to be that we could only place implants where the bone was,"" Dr. Katz says. ""Now, if the patient is otherwise considered to be a good candidate for implants and a bone graft, we can place the implant where it's needed. As dentists, we're learning to manipulate not only the soft tissue, but also the hard tissue.""

What might be a drawback for dental implants?

""Usually the price,"" notes Dr. Katz. ""The procedure is usually not covered by insurance to the same degree that other forms of tooth replacement, and the fee is definitely higher.”

Dr. Katz and his team offer informational sessions on dental implants and a thorough consultation to make sure their patients are fully informed about both the procedure and the potential cost.

""I will place and restore straightforward cases to keep the costs down for patients,"" he says, ""We have a 3D scanner here in the office for treatment planning that saves the patient travelling elsewhere.""

Walaa Zeidan, founder and owner of Remedi, set out to create a place where people could step away from the everyday stresses of the world to focus on self-care – and she has succeeded, in spades.

The medical spa offers a spectrum of services and treatments that go far beyond the surface including a team of medical doctors, naturopaths, medical estheticians and more.

“I have a strong belief that everything that happens in the body is connected, so we’re not just treating symptoms but root causes,” she said. “Skin conditions, hormone issues, female and male health, we look at a person from that holistic perspective, to find out what’s going on. One of my favourite parts is when we sit down and have a consultation and talk about what are some things that are going well and where are some areas you could use some support and help?”

Zeidan notes that Remedi has the most medical devices of any spa in Western Canada, all cutting-edge technology that lead the industry standard.

“We follow a medical model here, across the board, no matter what the service is,” she said. “We’re very serious about what we do, we ensure that everything we have is the absolute best quality, that our products are medical grade, that our staff are the best at what they do and that we ourselves never stop learning through education.”

This attention to quality and excellence goes beyond the treatments and technology. The space itself is designed in every way to be welcoming, and allow people to relax, feel comfortable, and enjoy a quiet moment in their busy lives.

Zeidan’s background in management consulting with a focus on feng shui and energy work helped her bring her vision and dream for Remedi to life.

“I really wanted a sense of harmony and well being for everyone who comes into contact with Remedi, with me and with my staff,” she said. “I wanted a hidden oasis here right in the heart of Burnaby. It’s not flashy and dramatic from the outside but when you come in you feel that five-star touch. We have thought of everything, heated floors, slippers to wear while visiting here, a built-in alkaline water machine.”

The facility also includes a beautiful 600-square foot enclosed patio – an oasis inside an oasis – with a firepit and loungers, for clients to relax or meditate.

“It was important to me that the space makes people feel as good as the services they receive,” she said. “It’s really about the art of self-care. I want to teach people that self-care is not a luxury, it’s a necessity. The most important relationship you have is the one with yourself.”

Her efforts have paid off: Remedi’s reputation has grown by leaps and bounds, with new clients coming through the door all the time. And while the growth and success is a positive sign for any business, it’s not the priority for Zeidan.

“It’s not about volume, about being busy – I want to see a change and make a difference in people’s lives,” she said. “Excellence is really about consistency, caring, taking pride in your work and everything you do. It’s about doing the right thing because it’s the right thing to do, and to be the best possible versions of ourselves.”

This, however, was not to be.

Some governments refrain from giving too much freedom to its population.

Even today, most governments love censoring content in their respective countries. Some block websites. Others block certain types of apps or services.

The Great Firewall of China is one example of restrictions as thousands of websites are blocked each year.

Elsewhere, you may be surprised to learn VoIP services offered by WhatsApp and Skype don’t work in the UAE.

You cannot access Netflix, and other streaming services in Iran because of government censorship.

WhatsApp was banned in Brazil for not providing chat data to the government. Twitter was blocked in Turkey because the government didn’t like some tweets being shared.

If these restrictions were not enough, private brands also started blocking websites in many countries. This usually applies to services such as HBO Now, Hulu, and Amazon Prime.

Even channels available in other countries offer limited libraries to users because of a practice called geo-licensing.

These licences restrict streaming channels from sharing content outside their respective regions.

Internet security has also been a major issue.

Gone are the days when thieves looted banks or your wallets to earn money. Today, they plunder from the comfort of their laptop.

They have learned the art of hacking into people’s devices by looking for loopholes to exploit. When found, they hack inside a device or account and steal data that can be used for blackmail or sold on the dark web.

Most victims are those who use public Wi-Fi in coffee shops or hotels. In case you’re not aware, public Wi-Fi is unsecure.

Even with a password they can be hacked.

How can a VPN help?

VPN is a network of servers spread across the world. Connecting to any of them changes your IP address. This is helpful so you can enjoy complete Internet freedom.

Moreover, VPNs offer encryption against online threats, is unbreakable, and can’t be bypassed by hackers or cybercriminals.

Even major surveillance agencies, including the FBI, cannot break through.

Before choosing a VPN find one with the largest server network and impressive security features.

PureVPN is recommended because it offers a server network of more than 2,000 servers in 140 countries, and has encryption and dedicated Wi-Fi security.

PureVPN can be configured on various devices such as iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, routers, Smart TVs, etc.

Yet clients often tend to sign standard form contracts and enter into agreements without carefully reading the small print or fully understanding the consequences.

""Whether you are a first-time homebuyer or an experienced real estate investor,"" says Cynthia Lam, a real estate lawyer at GBC Law, ""there are a lot of details to be taken into consideration when purchasing a property."" While clients can, for the most part, rely on the advice of a good Realtor™, they should take the time to consider the key terms.

For example, one of the common terms in standard real estate contracts is “Time is of the Essence”.

""Not many people truly understand the importance of this seemingly insignificant provision,"" says Cynthia. ""It can potentially cause a lot of issues and stress for some buyers or sellers. For example, parties often agree to certain dates for completion, possession and adjustment in the Contract of Purchase and Sale, without fully understanding what these dates mean.""

Buyers may be surprised to learn that a seller can rely on the ""Time is of the Essence"" provision to terminate a Contract if the buyer fails to deliver funds or satisfactorily execute the closing documents by the completion date.

""In a stable or 'flat' market,"" Cynthia explains, ""buyers and sellers tend to be more agreeable to amending terms or dates in the Contract of Purchase and Sale. However, in a market that is constantly fluctuating, there is an increased risk that one party may not be open to such flexibility.""

""At GBC Law,"" Cynthia adds, ""we always recommend that clients take the time to understand their obligations under the Contract. This is especially important since it is common practice for the Contract to be completed and executed without having it reviewed by a lawyer.""

Gregory J. Greiner, founder and principal lawyer of GBC Law, notes that commercial real estate dealings are more complex. ""In many commercial real estate purchases,"" Greg says, ""even though the dollar amount is smaller than the typical million dollar Burnaby home purchase, the contract can be considerably more complicated and there are more opportunities for good planning and preparation.

You feel healthier: the beauty of farmers markets is that you can see and learn about where your food comes from. You meet the farmers and learn about the nutritional benefits their food has to you. It’s better for the environment: when you buy food that has been grown nearby, you save the energy, petroleum and fossil fuels it takes to ship food around the world. Buying locally helps support those who need to be supported: buying from your local farmer means you are supporting local agriculture and buying from a local artisan means you are supporting a small business entrepreneur and you can definitely feel good about that. Fresh local food: farmers, like those at Peace Arch Farms, Floralia Growers, Stein Mountain Farm, Rockweld Farm, Snowy Mountain Organics, Leah Lake Farms, The Apple Man and many others provide seasonal, ripe produce, which can increase your overall health. Connect with others from the community: meeting your local farmers and artisans and talking to them about their food not only teaches you more than you’d learn in a grocery store chain, it helps build a stronger community. The food tastes better: taking a bite out of that heirloom tomato or crunching on that spicy radish will never taste as good as the ones grown by local hands. Get easy meals from local artisans: homemade soups from Kiki’s kitchen, savoury pies from Chef Enrick Food Corp and ravioli and dried pasta from Cowichan pasta are just some of the prepared foods that are available Find the perfect gift: shopping local has never been easier! From jewellery to pottery and craft liquors to clothes, there is the perfect gift for everyone at the Burnaby Artisan Farmers’ Market. Enjoy a fun family day:if weekends are your prime-time for errands, bring the whole family and shop while enjoying on-market and nearby family activities. On-market events include everything from food demonstrations to zucchini races. Deer Lake Park’s activities are also next door. Support a non-profit society:the organizers of the Burnaby market, Artisan Farmers’ Market Society, is a non-profit dedicated to supporting local agriculture and entrepreneurs and also donates to local charities such as the annual Run Up for Down Syndrome at SFU.

Burnaby Artisan Farmers’ Market is open on Saturdays from May to October with fresh and local produce, preserves, treats and great artisan gifts! Learn more at www.artisanmarkets.ca. Follow them on Facebook for their Saturday 9:30 am Facebook Live. You can also find them on Instagram and Twitter.

With a mandate that enables seniors to stay close to home and become involved in their community, the non-profit organization strives to assist groups of the community that are traditionally underserved.

For over 75 impactful years, New Vista Society has enriched countless lives by serving the heart of Burnaby. This multi-faceted healthcare and housing facility helps both low-income families and seniors by providing housing and care homes. They take pride in actively engaging the seniors they care for with the world around them. “Social interaction and being around people in the community is one of the biggest things seniors can do for themselves,” said Leslie Karmazinuk, the chief operating officer at New Vista Society. “The fact that we get to play a role in bridging these people, who are typically isolated and lonely, is really important to us.”

Karmazinuk has been working at New Vista Society for seven years. She says one of the biggest challenges older generations face is seclusion. “As we age the TV should not take the place of personal relationships and social interaction. However, with social programs that exercise both brains and bodies, New Vista Society engages seniors in a new way that they do not get at home. With happy hours, choirs and sing-a-longs, and physical therapy sessions led by in-house nurses, Karmazinuk said New Vista does a lot more than renew social lives – they restore dignity, too.

What started as one man opening his home to people in need during the Second World War has evolved into one of Burnaby’s bastions of community support. The legacy of Ernest Winch, the founder of what is now New Vista Society, has proven to transcend time. As the demographics and needs of the surrounding population have evolved, so has the focus of the Society. Seventy-five years later, Ernie Winch’s advocacy for social welfare and his commitment to the community persist and continue to grow with New Vista.

Rest Your Head: Set on an expansive double lot in a community nestled on the hill overlooking Gibsons Marina, The Seasalt Cottage is a quiet home base from which to explore Gibsons Landing and the nearby towns of Sechelt and Roberts Creek. The owner, Michele, has lovingly renovated the two guest suites—one on the ground level and one on the “Upper Deck,” in the complex in which she resides with her adorable French bulldog, Chloe.Each suite is bright and stylishly decorated with plush furnishings and marine-inspired décor touches (think seashells and a white and blue pastel colour scheme). Both guest units boast soaker tubs, TVs/Netflix, wifi and kitchenettes which are perfect for those wanting to stay for more than a couple of nights (and who wouldn’t want that when this adorable pup is one of your hosts?).

article continues below

While the interiors are pristine and calming, the exterior space at The Seasalt Cottage is truly spectacular. Both suites have their own private patios where guests can enjoy a glass of wine while relaxing and enjoying the refreshing sea breeze. These terraces extend onto a huge garden filled where undulating pathways winding past lush bushes, vines and flowers.

Michele has created a few different seating areas nestled within the garden where guests can while away summer afternoons swaying in one of the suspended rocking chairs while taking in views of the sparkling sea and listening to the sound of water trickling from the fountains installed throughout the garden. Guests can also make use of the communal barbecue, grilling up seafood bought at the Gibsons Farmer’s Market (or caught on a fishing trip) and enjoying it in the outdoor dining area under a grapevine-covered arbour.

Wine & Dine: Just a three-minute walk down the hill from The Seasalt Cottage you’ll find an array of hip boutiques, coffee shops, restaurants and pubs at Gibsons Landing. My friend Fran and I arrived late on a Friday night and as soon as we dropped our bags in our suite we made a beeline to Tapworks pub, on Michele’s recommendation. The brewery has recently expanded from a hole-in-the-wall behind Gibsons Art Gallery to a two-level hotspot to see-and-be-seen while sipping locally crafted brews.

After ascending to the second floor, Fran and I made ourselves comfortable next to the firepit and ordered beer tasting flights, flatbread and spinach and artichoke dip from the snack menu. It wasn’t long before we had made friends with a couple of folks in their sixties who were visiting from West Vancouver and a group of twenty-somethings who were in town from Kitsilano. By the end of the night, we were playing board games with our new friends in the pub’s first-floor area. I mentioned to Fran later that night that it was Gibsons’ friendly small-town vibe that had likely inspired us to bond with complete strangers so quickly: if we had encountered the same people in a Vancouver bar we probably wouldn’t have connected in the same way.

Other notable (and super hip) dining experiences in Gibsons include Buono Osteria, a new Italian restaurant with a warm ambiance that overlooks the marina. Opened by Wally Buono’s son, the eatery serves traditional Italian fare with a modern twist, as well as excellent wines. Fran and I loved the locally foraged wild mushroom Bucatini with celery root and sherry cream. For happy hour drinks, super fresh oysters and a fun environment, head to Smitty’s Oyster House which is set right on the water. Next door Lunitas Mexican Eatery serves up beer, margaritas and excellent Mexican fare.

No trip to Gibsons is complete without a meal at the infamous Molly’s Reach restaurant which made its mark in the ’70s as one of the locations in the infamous Beachcombers series. On Day 2, Fran and I started our morning with a bacon and egg breakfast at the eatery while listening to Elvis tunes and overlooking Gibsons Marina.

Later in the day we had coffee at the locally owned and operated Beachcomber Coffee shop, an energetic little place located right on Gibsons’ Gower Point strip. I loved the unexpected, youthful vibe of the space known for its neon yellow and green branding and club-style music. On the last morning of my stay, after Fran had returned to Vancouver, I sat on the patio for a couple of hours, drinking coffee and snacking on pastries from Sandy’s Bake Shoppe down the street, people-watching, chatting with the locals and listening as they caught up on life.

Explore: The Sunshine Coast is a haven for nature-lovers so hiking, kayaking, fishing and beach-going are givens for visitors to the area. Soames Hill is a beautiful intermediate hike that we completed in about an hour and rewarded us with spectacular views of the Georgia Strait and Keats and Bowen Islands. Davis Bay is a beautiful beach to park yourself for the day with a blanket and a book. And for breathtaking sunsets Bonniebrook beach comes highly recommended by the locals I chatted with a Beachcomber Coffee.

But there is also lots to do right in Gibsons. You could spend a few hours visiting the many shops and boutiques along the strip which sell well-curated homewares and local art, as we did. And the Gibsons Public Market, opened in March 2017, is a fun place to pick up local cheeses, fresh fish, produce and flowers, and to visit the Nicholas Sonntag Marine Education Centre which temporarily holds local marine life in its tanks until they are returned to their natural habitat.

After spending a weekend getting to know Gibsons, it’s strange for me to think that it was once a town I’d drive through, without a thought, on my way to Sechelt. Now I realize it’s a gem in its own right—and I’ll definitely be back the next time I want a fun and laid back experience just a boat ride from Vancouver.

Here’s how,[],,"Do you have a dream of immigrating to Canada? If you have a university degree from your home country, the process is relatively straightforward.

Canada is a welcoming country for individuals who want to invest their talents here. Case in point: it has a target of accepting 350,000 new immigrants every year by 2021.

article continues below

“We are 40 million people and yet we don’t have enough people living here to fulfill all the opportunities for growth,” says Rachel Gary, COO of Canada Direct. “The Canadian government is giving people the chance to have a good life here but there is the expectation that you contribute to the economy as well.”

The immigration process in Canada operates using a points system. Here, factors including work experience, level of education and English or French proficiency are taken into account. You can begin accumulating some points in your home country, but others require presence in Canada to accumulate.

When clients reach out to Canada Direct for help, a team member takes them through a questionnaire. Next, the team member sends the client profile to one of Canada Direct’s regulated Canadian immigration consultants.

Of all of the factors considered, education is one of the most important. A bachelor or master’s degree from another country is well-regarded in the application process but complications can arise when post-secondary education is at a technical school.

While many applicants have numerous years of work experience, they may not have the educational credentials to back it up, since job requirements may not be as stringent in other countries as they are in Canada. Gary says that in many Central American countries, for instance, a person can have management experience without a university degree.

If they want to continue working in their field, Gary suggests that they come to Canada on a student visa and study to get their university degree or college diploma. Canada Direct can also get them a work visa that allows them to earn both an income and more points for immigration.

Those who are over the age of 35 and possess only a high school diploma might find the immigration application process to be more difficult. However, it’s not impossible, says Gary. Some Canadian provinces are more lenient than others in terms of immigration application requirements, with Manitoba being the most relaxed (for instance, it does not require applicants to pass an English language test). Older applicants who are coming up against roadblocks may want to consider applying for a student visa. This can allow them to study for the qualifications that are required for employment.

Rebecca Collins, the owner of Dance Collective, said balancing the mental aspect of dance is just as important as the physical side.

“We help the physical aspect of dance and the mental to come together in unity so they are more balanced,” Collins explained. Relieving stress and promoting a positive self-image are two things Collins is bringing to her dancers by bringing in Brain Gym expert Mariah-Janes Thies which has made a difference with their competitive dancers. “And though we’re interested in cultivating artists, ultimately what we do is cultivate an environment. Where kids can be themselves, explore their identities, and grow into strong capable people with thoughts, visions, and ideas about the world. To learn a love of art and to learn even more from it."" In fact, for both dancers and instructors, Dance Collective is a second home.

The Burnaby dance studio is also the place where many dancers find their passion. “It helps kids with discovering their own creativity,” Collins said. When passion and creativity are shaped with commitment and discipline, as it is with dance, Collins said people are often better off for it.

Since Collins took over Dance Collective, it has expanded to become one of the top dance schools in the Lower Mainland. Bringing in her own jazz, tap and musical theatre background, Collins has brought in and built up a strong musical and lyrical platform to accompany the existing renowned RAD ballet program.

“We foster dance excellence, but in a fun, encouraging, and family-oriented environment,” Collins said, “we really want our dancers to discover their own creativity and take pride in what they’ve accomplished.”

Recognizing what a client needs and being able to deliver it – not just legally but also personally and emotionally – is part of what sets the Deer Lake Law Group apart.

“It’s not enough to provide great legal services, we must ensure that clients feel valued,” said Antonio Simoes who founded the Deer Lake Law Group with his spouse, Lana Shparberg. “Families and individuals find us during times of crisis and we should do whatever it takes to make the best of an unfortunate circumstance.”

In 2010, the Simoes family moved from Calgary to Burnaby. Simoes had practised law for more than a decade in Alberta. The pair opened the doors of their practice in 2011, and have been growing ever since.

In 2015, the Deer Lake Law Group moved into bigger offices at Deer Lake Centre, and the team – which Simoes describes as a family – now includes a large and diverse group of lawyers and support staff.

“We focus on finding timely and cost-effective solutions to life’s biggest and most unexpected challenges, like the breakdown of a family, car accidents, issues in the workplace, estate issues, applying for probate and more,” said Simoes. “Our main areas of practice are family litigation, family mediation, and estate litigation, but with six lawyers in the office, we can assist with virtually any situation.”

Simoes says it’s a priority for his team that every client feels supported through their unique and individual circumstances.

“We want our clients to find the ‘good in goodbye’ and to remain future-focused,” he said. “We help clients recognize that no matter the pain, physical or emotional, that they are feeling at this time, there is a happier life waiting for them.”

Additionally, Simoes notes that it’s critical to listen to clients at every step of the process, and to respond to what they want and need.

“We involve our clients in making decisions about the course of action to be taken on their file so that they feel in control of the process. While some clients prefer a low-conflict approach focused on negotiation and mediation, others choose to litigate aggressively. We help our clients pursue their choices so that there are fewer surprises in the end,” he said. “And my door is always open – I encourage clients to share with me any positive comments but also express to me any concerns that they may have.”

Simoes says Burnaby has been an ideal place to call home, both for himself and for Deer Lake Law Group.

“We love to keep things local: we live, work, shop and learn in Burnaby,” he said. “It’s the geographical centre of the greater Vancouver area and this makes it an ideal location to operate.”

The firm has been involved with a number of local community organizations and institutions, and have been members of the Burnaby Board of Trade for more than seven years.

No matter what the future brings, Simoes says the focus will remain the same: offering top-notch legal services to every single client.

“We have remained true to our roots as a small family-owned business with friendly staff and experienced lawyers. No matter how big we grow, we want everyone who walks through our doors to feel comfortable, welcome and heard.”

Just ask Ernesto Coelho, the latest massage therapist to join the team at Royal City Health & Manual Therapy.

article continues below

A number of years back, he had racked up a lengthy list of aches and pains while working out at the gym - without the guidance of a knowledgeable trainer - and realized he needed some help dealing with them.

“I finally gave in and booked for physio and massage therapy,” Coelho says. “That experience changed everything. In the weeks and sessions that followed, that sense of feeling your body getting better was incredible. I was being led on the path to feeling pain-free again, and these therapists were the ones leading the way.”

In particular, massage therapy left a deep impression on him for its one-on-one sessions.

“Instead of a divide where a practitioner works on a patient, the nature of massage therapy encourages the practitioner to work with the patient,” he says. “This approach, in my mind, really lends to the feeling of support and focused expertise that is so instrumental to healing.”

So, Coelho decided to study massage therapy and recently graduated from West Coast College of Massage Therapy.

And today he lays out that same path his massage therapists led him on, only now he also enjoys being able to derive satisfaction from seeing his clients improve.

“To me, it is definitely a warm and encompassing wave of satisfaction, pride, and also gratitude that we're able to do what we do for others,” Coelho says. “When I was a patient myself I had gotten that awesome rush of feeling your own body recover - it was an invincible feeling.

“Now, turn that around and imagine you’re the one capable of handing out that invincible feeling to others -that is supreme!”

It is also an intriguing challenge when he meets a client for the first time and begins mapping out a route to regain wellness.

“It's like being given a new puzzle to solve,” Coelho explains. “What's causing this patient discomfort? Is it this or that? Why don't we try this assessment test and see if it indicates anything?

“Truth be told, we may or may not even find any clues at all within the first session. Sometimes it's just not that straightforward. But when we finally solve the puzzle and see the patient fully functioning and happy, knowing that you yourself have had a hand in making it happen... that's when the giant warm wave rides over everything. There's nothing like it.”

And Derby Manor, a new affordable 55+ community in Burnaby run by a non-profit society, is planning to incorporate the philosophy into many of its programs.

Numerous studies locally and abroad have found seniors suffering from loneliness and isolation experience improved physical and mental health when they spend time in the company of youngsters on a regular basis. And young people reap the benefits of being supported with their activities such as schoolwork and hearing the wisdom shared by these elders.

Adele Fussi, Derby Manor’s general manager, shares a touching story that has inspired the residence to implement intergenerational programs into its curriculum of activities. “A choir from Caribou Hill highschool came to perform at the residence and afterwards they had a chance to chat with the seniors. We thought they would be pretty bored but when they went back to school they asked their teachers if they could come back every week!”

This experience inspired the residence to create a buddy system where a senior is partnered up with a student. Youngsters can teach the older folks such things as computer skills while the students will learn such qualities as patience, respect and compassion. “We’re hoping this [program] will happen by May 2018,” Fussi says.

There is also talk of eventually converting the large multipurpose room at the expansive and brightly decorated residence into an after-school daycare. “It’s something I would love to bring into this, it brightens up everybody,” says Fussi.

Buying local is easy during the spring and summer months when farmers markets set up shop in communities across the Lower Mainland, and leafy greens, voluptuous berries and fragrant herbs are in abundance. But come fall and winter, accessing local goods can be more of a challenge.

Here, Natalie Forstbauer, an organic farmer and author, shares her tips for loving local 365 days a year. To speak with Forstbauer and other farmers in person, visit the farmers’ markets in West Vancouver, Burnaby and Lonsdale Quay every May to October where you’ll find crafts, produce and other edibles brought to you locally by the non-profit Artisan Farmers’ Markets Society.

article continues below

Stock up on hearty produce. Before summer farmers markets come to a close in October, buy large quantities of items with longevity that will keep well into the cooler months. “Pick up a 25-pound bag of carrots, potatoes, onions, or apples to store in a cold room or at the bottom of the fridge,” advises Forstbauer. Winter squash is also another good one to stock up on because it will often last for months on the table displayed in a bowl. Grow your own year-round garden. It doesn’t get more local than your home kitchen! Try planting a small winter salad herb basket that you place on your windowsill to soak in the mid-winter sunshine, suggests Forstbauer. You can even grow a year-round garden from kitchen scraps; for example, put the last 3 cm of green onion stems and roots into a glass of water, and watch it grow! Shop the winter markets. Artisan Farmers Markets are open from spring until mid-fall. The rest of the year, farmers’ markets in New Westminster, Port Moody, Squamish, and Vancouver are open to serve customers seasonal items including kale, chard, carrots, squash, beets, potatoes, frozen berries, frozen meats, and preserved foods. You can also make a point of seeking out local produce at the grocery store. Preserve fruits and veggies at their peak. Berries, orchard fruit, tomatoes and onions are just a few of the items that can be canned, dried, frozen and stewed at the height of the season, to be enjoyed all year round. Imagine tasting the flavour of a sun-ripened Okanagan peach in the middle of January as you bite into a homemade Peach Crisp.



Natalie Forstbauer’s recipe for Simple Harvest Soup is ideal for either preserving summer’s vegetables, or enjoying fall’s harvest:

Simple Harvest Soup

Ingredients

1 medium/large onion, diced

4 to 6 cloves finely chopped garlic

3 to 4 medium carrots, diced

2 to 4 stalks of celery, diced (include the leaves)

1 small winter squash cubed (about 1 to 2 pounds) You may have to peel it; ask the farmer

1 to 3 large potatoes, diced

1 bunch finely chopped kale

1 large tomato, diced (optional)

½ teaspoon sea salt or Himalayan salt to taste

1 4-inch sprig thyme, or 1 to 2 tbsp. dried thyme (optional)

Instructions

Chop the vegetables into bite-size pieces and place in a large pot. Fill the pot with water (6 cups or so to cover the veggies, plus a bit extra). Bring to a boil, then simmer for 30 to 40 minutes.

Serve soup with salt and pepper to taste, or with grated cheddar cheese, sour cream and your favourite farmers market hot sauce. To complete the meal, add fresh farmers’ market bread from A Bread Affair or Gesundheit Bakery.

Choose any fine wine, craft beer, cooler, or pick from the diverse liquor selection and West Coast Liquor Company will put it all together and deliver it right to your door, usually within the hour.

Along with home delivery and VIP loyalty programs, Lucky believes what keeps customers coming back is the knowledge and friendliness of his staff.

West Coast Liquor's philosophy is to offer a high level of customer service and knowledgeable help is just part of that.""

Staff is trained to help customers find both what they're looking for, and also products that they may not know about.

""When someone comes in looking for wine, for example, we're going to ask them if they had a certain country in mind,"" Lucky says. ""Narrowing it down to either white, red, or rose is the next step, and then we'll ask about budget. If the customer has a dollar range, we'll keep that in mind when making recommendations.""

Lucky and his team at the Royal Oak store offer their own product suggestions based on what sells well and the latest wine or beer trends, but also throw in some personal recommendations.

""We're here to give top notch customer service,"" Lucky says. ""We go out of our way to make our customers happy. If they're looking for something we don't have, we're more than happy to order it in for them.""

Those looking to escape the West Coast weather can find adventure inside the indoor trampoline park, which is a short drive from Burnaby and an even shorter SkyTrain ride. Sky Zone has plenty of entertaining activities to make the trip well worth it.

“This is a different experience,” says Morey Chaplick, owner of Sky Zone Trampoline Park in Surrey. “We do unbelievably good birthday parties.”

In addition to birthday parties, the jump park has frequent activities and events that cannot be found anywhere else – at least, not under one roof.

Sky Zone specializes in five forms of completely unique entertainment, according to Chaplick:

1. SkyRobics. Working out doesn’t have to be boring, not when clients can leap into better health with trampoline fitness. This low-impact workout is gentle on the joints but hard on calories – it burns up to 1,000 calories per hour.

2. Foam Zone. For freewheeling, foamy fun, look to the Foam Zone. The pit filled with 10,000 foam cubes is great for practicing tricks, and it provides a feeling of weightlessness that most people never get to experience elsewhere.

3. Ultimate Dodgeball. Dodging and diving on trampolines is such a good time, players might almost forget they’re competing for Ultimate Dodgeball victory. And for those competitive types who are all about the win, they can form a team and give their all in the Ultimate Dodgeball Tournament.

4. Sky Slam.Most people will never jump like Michael Jordan – at least, not without help. Sky Zone’s trampoline launch pads are just the thing, giving anyone the chance to brag about their slam dunks and pro skills.

5. Open Jump. But why choose? Open Jump allows jumpers to practice flips in the free jump area, the Main Court, leap into the Foam Zone, take part in a daily pickup Ultimate Dodgeball game, or sink a shot at Sky Jam. And for the truly inexhaustible jumper, they can do it all in one day.

For more information about what’s happening at Sky Zone Trampoline Park in Surrey, call 778-395-5867 or their website. Sky Zone in Surrey is at 11125-124th Street, just over the Pattullo Bridge. The indoor trampoline park can also be found on Facebook.",[]

For the team at North Burnaby Dental Group, it’s a trio of factors: longevity, growth and patient satisfaction. And they have all three in spades.

The practice has been serving its patients for more than 60 continuous years, all while steadily growing in size and scope, and providing a level of patient care that draws new patients in the door every month alongside lifelong ones – some of whom come from across the Lower Mainland and even the Gulf Islands to see their favourite dental providers.

Even in times of change, the focus is always on ensuring the best care for every patient, by fostering a staff of topnotch care providers. This year, Dr. Ron McCaffrey retired after 40 years, and Dr. Laura Schmidt came on board. Dr. Lisa Kostecki has moved to Ontario to raise her family, and Dr. Sherry Milani has taken over in her stead. The practice also welcomed periodontist, Dr. Mandy Nematollahi, orthodontist Dr. Sayeh Ehsani, and additional dentists Dr. Chad Pennington and Dr. Farzad Erfan.

“Our whole team works together to ensure that the care of the patient takes priority over anything else,” said Dr. Houman Houchmand.

In all, the team at North Burnaby Dental Group includes nearly 40 people – including administrative staff, hygienists, and a variety of specialists – who work as a close-knit group to provide the best care every single day.

“This practice really operates as a family,” said Dr. Houchmand, noting that there are staff members who have been part of the team for several decades.

Another factor in their continued success has been an ongoing focus on always being ahead of the curve on new techniques, equipment and technology for their patients.

“We offer sedation for nervous patients and our staff is trained to make people feel at ease and to decrease their stress,” said Dr. Houchmand. “We have the latest technology available, from CAT scans to lasers. We want to offer the best dental care, plain and simple.”

Their approach has certainly worked – with six decades under their belts, they continue to draw new patients largely due to word-of-mouth recommendations from current patients.

“We have been here a long time and generations of families come from all over, including the island, to continue their dental care with us,” he said. “We have several patients who are more than 100 years old and have been coming to us for half their lives.”

For Dr. Houchmand and his team, it’s rewarding to see those long time relationships continue and to be able to develop new ones.

“We really want people to walk away saying that was the best service they ever had, that we explained everything and that we were extremely friendly,” he said. “We want our patients to feel that they are coming to the best dental practice in Burnaby, and that they are truly among a team that cares and puts patients first.”

It’s a philosophy that influences every part of the organization’s work.

“I know that if you treat people the way you would like to be treated, then success will follow,” he said.

As part of the booming Heights neighbourhood, the clinic enjoys a central location between downtown and Coquitlam and beyond, with easy transit access.
